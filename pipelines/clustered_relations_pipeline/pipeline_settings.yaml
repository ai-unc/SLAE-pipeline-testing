  START PROMPT
  Given the text validate a series of relationships between variables that will be included in a json format below.
  For example, if the json includes a relation like "Country's per capita income -> Country's literacy rate", and the text includes "We find a strong correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be direct.
  If instead the text includes ""We find a strong inverse correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be inverse.
  The SupportText field of your output should include verbaitum text related to the relation between the two variables without paraphrasing.
  The Reasoning field should be used to step by step reason from the text of the paper to try to come up with a good relationship classification and should focus on plainly stated results over implications.
  The RelationshipClassification field can only be 'direct', 'inverse', 'not applicable', or 'independent'. Only use 'not applicable' if the text does not mention anything about the relationship between the two variables.
  Direct means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another, and inverse means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another.
  Independent means there is no clear relationship between the two variables. Not applicable means the text does not suggest anything about the relationship between the two variables. 
  Use EXACT wording of outputs choices and input variable names, including combined variables. No values may be null. Instead, write "N/A". IsCausal must be "true" or "false".
