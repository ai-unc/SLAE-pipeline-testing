Li?, Ellison Suthoff* and Alix Arnaud?\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Depression (major depressive disorder [MDD]) affects the functioning of patients in many facets of\nlife. Very few large-scale studies to date have compared health and economic related outcomes of those with versus\nwithout depression, and across various depression severity groups. We aimed to evaluate humanistic and economic\nburden in respondents with and without depression diagnosis, and across symptom severity groups.\n\nMethods: Data from the 2017 US National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) were utilized. Of the adult respond-\nents (N=75,004), 59,786 were < 65 years old. Respondents not meeting eligibility criteria were excluded (e.g. those\nself-reporting bipolar disorder or experiencing depression in past 12 months but no depression diagnosis). Overall,\ndata from 39,331 eligible respondents (aged 18-64 years) were analyzed; and comprised respondents \u2018with depres-\nsion diagnosis\u2019 (n= 8853; self-reporting physician diagnosis of depression and experiencing depression in past\n\n12 months) and respondents \u2018without depression diagnosis\u2019 (n=30,478; no self-reported physician diagnosis of\ndepression and not experiencing depression). Respondents with depression were further examined across depression\nseverity based on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Outcome measures included health-related quality-of-life\n(HRQoL; Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form [SF-36v2]: mental and physical component summary [MCS and\nPCS]; Short-Form 6 Dimensions [SF-6D]; and EuroQol 5 Dimensions [EQ-5D]), work productivity and activity impair-\nment (WPAI), and health resource utilization (HRU). Multivariate analysis was performed to examine group differences\nafter adjusting covariates.\n\nResults: Respondents with depression diagnosis reported significantly higher rates of diagnosed anxiety and sleep\nproblems versus those without depression (for both; P< 0.001). Adjusted MCS, PCS, SF-6D, and EQ-5D scores were\nsignificantly lower in respondents with depression versus those without depression (all P< 0.001). Consistently,\nrespondents with depression reported higher absenteeism, presenteeism, and overall WPAI, as well as greater number\nof provider visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations compared with those without depression (all P< 0.001).\nFurther, burden of each outcome increased with an increase in disease severity.\n\nConclusions: Diagnosed depression was associated with lower health-related quality-of-life and work productivity,\nand higher healthcare utilization than those without depression, and burden increased with an increase in symp-\ntom severity. The results show the burden of depression remains high even among those experiencing minimal\nsymptoms.\n\n\u201cCorrespondence: Shaloo Gupta@cernerenviza.com\n\n2 Cerner Enviza, 51 Valley Stream Pkwy, Malvern, PA 19355, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2022.

BMC Psychiatry (2022) 22:542\n\nPage 20f 14\n\nKeywords: Anxiety, Depression, Healthcare resource utilization, Quality of life, Sleep disorder, Work productivity\n\nBackground\n\nDepression is a common mental disorder in the United\nStates (US) [1]. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a\nform of depression, defined as the presence of>5 of the\nfollowing symptoms in the same 2-week period (with> 1\nsymptom being depressed mood or anhedonia): (1)\ndepressed mood, (2) marked loss of interest or pleasure\nin everyday activities (anhedonia), (3) significant change\nin weight or change in appetite, (4) insomnia or hyper-\nsomnia, (5) psychomotor agitation or retardation, (6)\nfatigue or loss of energy, (7) feelings of worthlessness or\nguilt, (8) diminished ability to think or concentrate, and\n(9) recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or\nsuicide attempt [2]. Additional criteria that must be met\nfor an MDD diagnosis are: the symptoms cause signifi-\ncant distress/impairment, the episode is not attributable\nto a substance\u2019s physiological effects, occurrence of epi-\nsode is not explained by other psychotic disorders, and\nabsence of a manic episode/hypomanic-like episode\n[2]. According to the Global Burden of Disease study\n(1990 to 2017), the incident cases of MDD increased by\n49.29% from 162 to 241 million globally [3]. As per the\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health report, 21.0\nmillion adults had experienced > 1 major depressive epi-\nsode in 2020, representing 8.4% of the adult population\nin the US; prevalence was higher among female adults\nthan males and in individuals aged 18-49 years than those\naged > 50 years [4].\n\nNumerous studies have reported on the detrimental\nimpact of MDD on overall health-related quality of life\n(HRQoL) in terms of interpersonal relationships, and\npsychological and physical functioning, noting that the\npsychological impairment can persist even after remis-\nsion of MDD symptoms [5-9]. According to an analysis of\nquality of life (QoL) data from the Sequenced Treatment\nAlternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, < 3% of\nuntreated patients with MDD reported \u201cwithin-normal\u201d\nQoL and approximately 50% of treated patients contin-\nued to experience \u201cseverely-impaired\u201d QoL [9]. Moreo-\nver, another analysis of the STAR*D trial data reported a\ndecrease in both response and remission rates with each\nstep of treatment [10].\n\nFurther, previous studies have shown that depression\naffects work productivity [11] and increases healthcare\nresource utilization (HRU), leading to higher direct and\nindirect costs with increasing severity of depression [12,\n13]. The economic burden in adults with MDD is high,\nwith 37.9% increase ($237 billion to $326 billion) in\nall costs from 2010 to 2018 in the US [14]. This burden\n\nincludes the costs attributed to not only MDD manage-\nment (37.0%) but also comorbid conditions (63.0%) [14].\n\nA nationally representative survey (2012-2013) con-\nducted in the US reported that among respondents with\nlifetime MDD (n=7432), the lifetime prevalence of\ncomorbid anxiety disorder was 37.3% and substance use\ndisorder was 57.9% [15]. Patients with both MDD and\nanxiety disorders incur higher healthcare costs as com-\npared to those with either disorder alone [16]. Consider-\ning the humanistic and economic impact MDD has on\nan individual, it is important to not only treat depressive\nsymptoms but also focus on improving overall QoL in the\npresence of comorbidities.\n\nAlthough previous studies have evaluated the burden\nof MDD on QoL [5, 7-9], work productivity and activity\nimpairment (WPAI) [11-13], HRU [12], and health eco-\nnomic outcomes across depression severity groups [5, 7,\n12, 13], few studies to date have compared the outcomes\nof those without depression to those with depression or\nacross various depression severity groups in a large sam-\nple size in the US [12, 14]. Thus, there is a need for more\nrecent data in the US population. The objective of this\nlarge, cross-sectional study was to evaluate the humanistic\nand economic burden of depression in the US by compar-\ning outcomes (HRQoL, WPAL and HRU) of respondents\nwith depression diagnosis versus without depression diag-\nnosis and also across symptom severity groups.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design and data source\n\nThis study was conducted using data from the 2017\nUS National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS;\nN=75,004). The NHWS is a self-administered, internet-\nbased survey of a sample of adults (aged > 18 years) that\nprovides \u201creal world\u201d patient-level information over 165\ntherapeutic conditions. Potential respondents for the\nsurvey are recruited through a general-purpose web-\nbased consumer panel. The panel recruits its members\nvia opt-in e-mails, co-registration with panel partners,\ne-newsletter campaigns, banner placements, and affiliate\nnetworks. All the respondents who explicitly agreed to\nbe a panel member registered through a unique e-mail\naddress and completed an in-depth demographic regis-\ntration profile. A quota sampling procedure (using data\nfrom the Current Population Survey of the US Census)\nwas used to ensure that the final NHWS sample was\nrepresentative of the US\u2019 adult population in 2017 with\nrespect to age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Informed\nconsent was obtained from all the respondents and all\n\n\nJain et al.

Disease-specific diagnoses includ-\ning depression, anxiety, and sleep difficulties were also\nanalyzed.\n\n\nJain et al. BMC Psychiatry (2022) 22:542\n\nDepression symptoms, anxiety and sleep problems\nDepression symptoms assessed that prompted respond-\nents to see their doctor included self-reported depressed\nmood and other emotional problems, changes in eat-\ning and sleep patterns, mental changes (e.g, forgetful-\nness, difficulty thinking, difficulty concentrating), and\nsocial and physical problems. Sleep problems including\nself-reported difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying\nawake, daytime sleepiness, leg cramps/leg problems,\nnight sweats/hot flashes, and poor quality of sleep\nwere evaluated. Anxiety was assessed according to the\nself-reported diagnoses of anxiety disorders and self-\nreported experiences of anxiety. Additionally, anxiety\nwas measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7\n(GAD-7) scale (Supplementary Table 1) [19].\n\nHealth-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health utilities\n\nShort Form Survey Instrument version 2 (SF-36v2) HRQoL\nwas assessed using the SF-36v2 [20], which is a multi-\npurpose, generic health status instrument comprised of\n36 questions. The instrument is designed to report eight\nhealth domains (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bod-\nily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-\nEmotional, and Mental Health) and two summary scores\n(Physical Component Summary [PCS] and Mental Com-\nponent Summary [MCS]). Each domain and PCS and MCS\nscores are normed to a mean of 50 and a standard deviation\nof 10 for the US\u2019 population. Higher scores are indicative of\nbetter health status [20]. SF-36v2 related parameters were\nstudied based on past 4 weeks health status. Additionally,\nhealth state utility index was calculated using the Short-\nForm 6 Dimensions (SF-6D) form. The SF-6D is a prefer-\nence-based single index measure for health using general\npopulation values and provides scores on a theoretical 0-1\nscale with higher scores indicating better health status [21].\n\nEuroQol 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire The Euro-\nQol 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L)\n[21] consists of a descriptive system (EQ-5D) and a vis-\nual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system is\ncomposed of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual\nactivities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The\nEQ VAS (score: 0 to 100) indicates the respondent's self-\nrated health, with the endpoints being Best imaginable\nhealth state\u2019 (score=100) and \"Worst imaginable health\nstate\u2019 (score=0). Lower overall scores on the EQ-5D-5L\nhealth utilities are indicative of higher disability. The\nmost recent version with 5-point rating scales for each\ndimension was used in this study [22]. The EQ-5D-5L\nutility scores were calculated by mapping the five-level\ndescriptive system (EQ-5D-5L) onto the three-level\nvalue set (EQ-5D-3L) using the mapping (\u201ccrosswalk\u201d)\n\nPage 4of 14\n\napproach developed by van Hout et al. [23]. Health states\nwere mapped using country-specific value set.\n\nWork productivity and activity impairment (WPAI)\n\nWork productivity loss was measured using the WPAI\nquestionnaire [24], a six-item validated instrument which\nconsists of four metrics: absenteeism (the percentage\nof work time missed because of one\u2019s health in the past\nseven days), presenteeism-related impairment (the per-\ncentage of impairment experienced while at work in the\npast seven days because of one\u2019s health), overall work\nproductivity loss (an overall impairment estimate that it\nis a combination of absenteeism and presenteeism), and\nactivity impairment (the percentage of impairment in\ndaily activities because of one\u2019s health in the past seven\ndays). Only respondents who reported being employed\nfull-time or part-time provided data for absenteeism,\npresenteeism, and overall work impairment; all respond-\nents reported data for activity impairment.\n\nHealth-resource utilization (HRU)\n\nHealthcare utilization was defined by the number of\nhealthcare provider (HCP) visits (e.g. general practi-\ntioner, internist, cardiologist, gynecologist, etc.), the\nnumber of emergency room (ER) visits, and the number\nof times hospitalized in the past six months. All outcome\nmeasures and scales [19-21, 24, 25] used in this study are\ndetailed in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nStatistical analyses\nChi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests\nwere used to determine the significant differences for\ncategorical variables and continuous variables, respec-\ntively. These results served to characterize differences\nbetween respondents with and without a depression\ndiagnosis as well as between no/minimal, mild, moder-\nate, moderately severe, and severe diagnosed depres-\nsion and informed the selection of covariates for\nmultivariable models.\n\nGeneralized linear models (GLMs) were used to con-\ntrol for demographic, health characteristic and comor-\nbidity variables to compare HRQoL, WPAI, and HRU\nbetween respondents with and without a depression\ndiagnosis and across symptom severity among respond-\nents with a depression diagnosis. Only variables that\nwere statistically significant in the bivariate analysis and\nhad clinical importance were included in the regression\nmodels. GLMs with a negative binomial distribution\nwere used for skewed data (e.g., WPAI and HRU).\n\nThe covariates included in the multivariable models\nwere: Age (continuous), gender (male vs. female), ethnic-\nity (black, hispanic, other vs. white [reference]), marital\n\n\nJain et al. BMC Psychiatry (2022) 22:542\n\nstatus (single, decline to answer vs. married/living with\npartner [reference]), education (less than college, decline\nto answer vs. college education [reference], income\n(<50 k, 50-75 k, decline to answer vs. 75 k + [reference]),\nemployment (employed vs. not), insured (yes vs. no),\nBMI (underweight, overweight, obese [combined obese\nand morbidly obese], decline to answer vs. normal weight\n[reference]), smoking (former, current vs. never smoked),\nCCl and individual comorbidities. The individual comor-\nbidities included: Diagnosed with anxiety, nasal allergies/\nhay fever, allergies, pain, hypertension, high cholesterol,\nmigraine, generalized anxiety disorder, heartburn, social\nanxiety disorder, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma,\narthritis, panic disorder, acne, post-traumatic stress dis-\norder, urinary tract infection, irritable bowel syndrome,\ndry eye, sleep apnea, eczema, thyroid problem, diabetes,\nyeast infection, and bladder control condition.\n\nIn bivariate analyses, comparisons were made for: (a)\n\u2018with depression diagnosis\u2019 versus \u2018without depression\ndiagnosis\u2019 groups, and (b) across all severity groups using\nan overall omnibus test. In multivariable analyses, com-\nparisons were made for: (a) \u2018with depression diagnosis\u2019\ngroup versus \u2018without depression diagnosis\u2019 group (ref-\nerence), and (b) mild, moderate, moderately severe, or\nsevere groups versus \u2018no/minimal\u2019 symptoms. severity\ngroup (reference). P-value less than 0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nThe NHWS total US adult population consisted of 75,004\nrespondents, of which 59,786 respondents were < 65 years\nold. Of these, respondents who self-reported bipolar\ndisorder/screened positive on the mood disorder ques-\ntionnaire were excluded (n=3322). Of the non-bipolar\nrespondents (n=56,464): (a) 15,419 respondents self-\nreported experiencing depression in the past 12 months,\nof which 8853 respondents reported diagnosed depres-\nsion; (b) 39,301 respondents did not self-report experi-\nencing depression in the past 12 months and reported no\ndepression diagnosis, of which 30,478 respondents had\nPHQ-9 scores <4 and screened negative for MDD based\non the PHQ-9; and (c) 1744 respondents did not self-\nreport experiencing depression in the past 12 months but\nwere diagnosed (at any point) (Fig. 1).\n\nThis study included a total of 39,331 eligible respond-\nents (aged 18-64 years), consisting of 8853 respondents\nwho reported depression diagnosis and 30,478 respond-\nents who reported no depression diagnosis. Respond-\nents with depression diagnosis were further stratified\nby PHQ-9 scores as indicated in Fig. 1. Among these\nrespondents, 47.2% had moderate to severe symptoms,\n31.6% had mild symptoms, and 21.2% had no/minimal\ndepression symptoms at the time of survey.\n\nPage 5 of 14\n\nDemographics and health characteristics\nData on the demographic and health characteristics,\ndepression symptoms, anxiety and sleep problems,\nand prescription use for treating anxiety disorders or\nsleep problems collected from NHWS respondents are\nreported in Table 1. Respondents with depression diag-\nnosis were more likely to be female, non-Hispanic white,\nsingle, have less than a college education, have lower\nannual household income, and less likely to be employed\nfull-time than respondents without a depression diagno-\nsis (all P<0.001) (Table 1). Those with severe symptoms\ntended to be younger, female, single, have less than a col-\nlege education, have lower annual household income,\nand less likely to be employed full-time compared to\nthose with no/minimal symptoms (all omnibus P< 0.001).\nFurthermore, respondents with severe symptoms also\ntended to be obese, less likely to exercise regularly, and\nhave higher CCI scores compared to those with no/mini-\nmal symptoms (all omnibus P< 0.001).\n\nDepression symptoms and anxiety and sleep problems\nThe most frequent depression symptoms reported by\nrespondents with a depression diagnosis were depressed\nmood and other emotional problems (88.0%), followed\nby mental changes (e.g., forgetfulness, difficulty think-\ning, difficulty concentrating; 49.0%), and sleep pat-\n\ntern changes (43.8%; Table 1). A higher proportion\n\ncompared to respondents with-\n\nout depression diagnosis (Table 1). The proportion of\n\nMean GAD-7 scores were higher in respondents with\na depression diagnosis (total) (8.0) as well as those with\nno/minimal symptoms (3.1) than respondents without\ndepression diagnosis (1.16). GAD-7 scores increased (ie,\nworsened) with increasing severity of depression symp-\ntoms (Table 1).\n\n\nJain et al.

BMC Psychiatry (2022) 22:542\n\npresenteeism, overall work impairment, and activity\nimpairment increased (all P<0.001) compared to those\nwith no/minimal symptoms (Fig. 3b). Respondents with\ndepression diagnosis reported greater number of HCP\nvisits (3.6 vs. 2.4), ER visits (0.14 vs. 0.09), and hospitaliza-\ntions (0.08 vs. 0.04) than respondents without depression\ndiagnosis (all P<0.001) in the last 6 months (Table 2). In\ngeneral, the mean number of HCP visits, ER visits, and\nhospitalizations in the last six months increased with\nincreasing severity. Respondents with severe depression\nsymptoms reported significantly higher HRU compared\nto those with no/minimal symptoms (P< 0.050).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe current study provides important insights into the\nhumanistic and economic burden associated with diag-\nnosed depression in the US. The study findings demon-\nstrate that notable differences exist in terms of symptom\nburden, QoL, WPAIL and HRU between respondents\nwith depression diagnosis (self-reported) versus those\nwithout depression diagnosis, as well as across depres-\nsion groups based on severity.\n\nThe sociodemographic characteristics of respondents\nwith depression diagnosis correlated with previous stud-\nies in terms of high prevalence in women and high rates\nof comorbidities, most notably anxiety, compared to\nthose without depression diagnosis [26, 27]. In the cur-\nrent study, 73.2% of subjects with depression reported\na diagnosis of anxiety, which is in line with previous\nresearch that reported significant anxiety in majority of\npatients with depression (85%) [27].\n\nIn our study, of those respondents with depression\ndiagnosis (1=8853), 47.2% had moderate-to-severe\nsymptoms and 21.2% had no/minimal symptoms of\ndepression, at the time of the survey. Respondents with\nno/minimal symptoms of depression, as determined by\nthe PHQ-9 scores at the time of survey, indicate poten-\ntial remission or that depression had resolved. How-\never, these respondents still reported a higher burden\nof anxiety and sleep issues than respondents without a\ndepression diagnosis. These findings are consistent with\npublished studies which indicate that patients\u2019 sympto-\nmatic recovery could be misleading as they may continue\nto experience reduced QoL and disabling residual symp-\ntoms, while in remission [9, 28-30].\n\nConsistent with previously published studies,\nrespondents with depression diagnosis had poorer\nHRQoL (with lower scores on MCS, PCS, SF-6D, and\nEQ-5D scores) compared to those without depression\ndiagnosis [7, 31, 32]. In the STAR*D study approxi-\nmately 50% of the patients with depression reported\nexperiencing \u201cseverely impaired\u201d QoL even after anti-\ndepressant treatment [9]. The minimal important\n\nPage 100f 14\n\ndifference (MID) of 3 points on the MCS [33] was\nexceeded in the present study (with depression diagno-\nsis: 38.8; without depression diagnosis: 51.8; P<0.001),\nfurther confirming poorer mental health in respondents\nwith depression; however, although PCS was signifi-\ncantly different between respondents with depression\ndiagnosis versus without depression diagnosis (52.2 vs\n52.8; P<0.001), the MID of 3 points on the PCS [33]\nwas not reached. Respondents with higher depressive\nsymptom severity also reported a higher burden of ill-\nness across various health indices as compared with the\nno/minimal symptom severity group. A similar trend\nwas reported by a study in Europe that showed reduced\nHRQoL as assessed by SF-12 and the EQ-5D utility\nindex scores in patients with MDD [5]. Taken together,\nthe data are suggestive of the substantial humanistic\nburden and need for specific interventions to improve\nHRQoL in patients with depression.\n\nThe current study also demonstrated that respondents\nwith depression diagnosis reported greater work produc-\ntivity losses when employed than respondents without\ndepression diagnosis. These results are in agreement with\npreviously published data that demonstrated higher presen-\nteeism, absenteeism, overall work impairment, and activity\nimpairment in those with depression versus those without\ndepression [31, 34, 35]. We also observed higher presentee-\nism than absenteeism in the current study, which is consist-\nent with previous research [31], where presenteeism could\nbe identified as the primary contributor to work productiv-\nity loss. Further, studies by Beck et al. reported that even\nminimal levels of depression symptoms were associated\nwith loss of work productivity [13, 36]. Our findings are\nin line with prior research that demonstrated increase in\nWPA with the severity of the disease [12, 34, 36].\n\nIn the current study, respondents with depression diag-\nnosis had a greater number of HCP visits, ER visits, and\nhospitalizations than those without depression diagno-\nsis. These findings are in accord with prior research that\nreported higher HRU in those with depression compared\nto controls [31, 32]. In our study, the frequency of hos-\npitalizations and ER visits increased with increase in the\nseverity of depression, similar to previous research [12].\nCollectively these observations suggest that respondents\nwith a depression diagnosis may incur higher direct and\nindirect costs than those without depression.\n\nRecently, research has shown the impact of the pan-\ndemic on mental health, and the growing prevalence of\ndepression [37, 38]. Thus, the treatment of depression has\nbecome an even more critical issue, from both humanis-\ntic and economic perspectives.\n\n\nJain et al.

This increases our understanding about the\noverall effect of depression on the HRQoL of patients as\nwell as the burden of lost work productivity on employ-\ners and increased resource utilization on payers. Substan-\ntially higher burden of illness even among respondents\nwith minimal symptoms (vs. those without depression)\nis suggestive that they might not be exhibiting symp-\ntoms on common and validated scales (such as PHQ-9 in\nthis case). It is important to note that the evaluation of\ntreatment efficacy typically focuses on depression symp-\ntom scales that are an important part of treatment, but\ndo not fully capture patient-centric concepts related to\nwell-being. Considering the impact that depression has\non various aspects of patients\u2019 lives, there is an additional\nneed to treat patients focusing on core symptom resolu-\ntion as well as overall and broader well-being, including\nfunctional improvement and minimizing residual symp-\ntoms [29, 39-42]. Additionally, it is important to broaden\nthe routine outcome monitoring systems [43] to effec-\ntively capture patients\u2019 experiences, perspectives, needs,\nand priorities and incorporating them into the treatment\napproach for better outcomes [42]. The combination of\npsychotherapy and pharmacotherapy has already shown\nto improve QoL and work productivity in patients diag-\nnosed with depression [35, 44, 45]. Observations from\n\nof depression, reported not experiencing depression in the past\n\nthis study provide insights for future research, while\nreinforcing the widespread need for novel, effective, and\naccessible treatment options for depression considering\nthe negative impact of increasing depression severity on\noutcomes.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nThe sampling methodology utilized in the NHWS is\ndesigned to generate a representative sample of the US\u2019\ngeneral population. However, results from this study may\nnot be generalizable to the US\u2019 population of patients\ndiagnosed with depression. As an internet-based survey,\nsimilar to other patient-reported surveys, this approach\nlikely underrepresents people with no access to or lack of\ncomfort with online administration, less healthy elderly\npeople, institutionalized patients, and those with low\nhealth literacy, severe comorbidities, and disabilities.\nThe self-reported nature of the NHWS is also associated\nwith potential corresponding biases such as recall and\nself-presentation biases. To reduce recall bias, shorter\nand recent timeframes for questions were chosen (e.g.,\nHRU in the past 6 months). Moreover, the survey con-\ntent was thoroughly reviewed with the study team to\navoid any self-presentation bias. Physician records were\nnot reviewed as part of the current study and therefore\nphysician-diagnosed depression could not be verified.\nThus, patients\u2019 self-reported diagnosis of depression was\nrecorded, which may have created a bias in the results\nobtained. Further, associations between depression and\noutcomes (e.g, HRU, HRQoL) may be complex due to\n\n\nJain et al. BMC Psychiatry (2022) 22:542\n\nthe presence of comorbidities, which might have affected\nthe results; these effects were controlled by including\npotential comorbidities as covariates in the multivariable\nanalyses. However, there may be other confounders not\ncollected in the current study.\n\nPHQ-9, a well-validated and commonly used screening\nand monitoring scale, was used as one of the eligibility\ncriteria and to classify the severity of depression. Previ\nously published studies stated that PHQ-9 can be consid-\nered for screening but PHQ-9 scores above cut-off should\nbe interpreted with caution or should be coupled with\nother assessment tools for definitive diagnosis in patients\nwith major depression [46, 47]. Patients may rate high on\nthe scale total score without having elevated core symp-\ntoms of depression. Additionally, demographic, cultural,\nand religious backgrounds may impact how a patient\nanswers certain questions. No strong causal conclusions\ncan be drawn between MDD and outcomes due to the\ncross-sectional nature of this study. Hence, a longitudinal\nstudy would be needed to reduce bidirectional effects.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe overall study results demonstrate that respondents\nwith depression diagnosis (self-reported) experienced\nlower HRQoL, higher WPAL and greater HRU compared\nto those without depression diagnosis. The humanis-\ntic and economic burden of depression increased with\nseverity of illness. Furthermore, the study results high-\nlight that the burden of depression remains high, even\namong those experiencing minimal severity/symptoms\nof depression. Although such patients may show symp-\ntomatic relief/remission of symptoms, they continue\nto experience lower QoL compared to controls. These\nresults indicate the need for novel and effective treat-\nments that help improve patients\u2019 wellness and function-\ning for this psychiatric disorder. Further, while treating\npatients, it is important to focus not only on the resolu-\ntion of depressive symptoms but also on the overall well-\nbeing, including functional improvement.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nANOVA: Analysis of Variance; BMI: Body mass index; CCl: Charlson Comorbidity\nIndex; EQ-5D-5L: EuroQol 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire; EQ VAS: EuroQol\nVisual Analogue Scale; ER: Emergency room; GAD-7: Generalized Anxiety\nDisorder-7 scale; GLMs: Generalized linear models; HCP: Healthcare provider;\nHRQoL: Health related quality of life; HRU: Healthcare resource utilization; MCS:\nMental component summary; MOD: Major depressive disorder; MID: Minimal\nimportant difference; NHWS: National Health and Wellness Survey; PCS: Physi-\nal component summary; PHQ-9: Patient Health Questionnaire-9; QoL: Quality\nof lfe; SF-36v2: Short Form Survey Instrument version 2; SF-60: Short-Form-6\nDimensions; STAR'D: Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression;\nUS: United States; WPA: Work productivity and activity impairment\n\nPage 120f 14\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https/dol.\n0rg/10.1186/512888-022-04165-x.\n\nAdditional file 1: Supplementary Table 1.
