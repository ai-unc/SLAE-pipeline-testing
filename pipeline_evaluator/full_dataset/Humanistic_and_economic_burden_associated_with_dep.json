Li2, Ellison Suthoff3 and Alix Arnaud3 Abstract Background: Depression (major depressive disorder [MDD]) affects the functioning of patients in many facets of life. Very few large-scale studies to date have compared health and economic related outcomes of those with versus without depression, and across various depression severity groups. We aimed to evaluate humanistic and economic burden in respondents with and without depression diagnosis, and across symptom severity groups.Methods: Data from the 2017 US National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) were utilized. Of the adult respond-ents (N = 75,004), 59,786 were < 65 years old. Respondents not meeting eligibility criteria were excluded (e.g., those self-reporting bipolar disorder or experiencing depression in past 12 months but no depression diagnosis). Overall, data from 39,331 eligible respondents (aged 18\u201364 years) were analyzed; and comprised respondents \u2018with depres-sion diagnosis\u2019 (n = 8853; self-reporting physician diagnosis of depression and experiencing depression in past 12 months) and respondents \u2018without depression diagnosis\u2019 (n = 30,478; no self-reported physician diagnosis of depression and not experiencing depression). Respondents with depression were further examined across depression severity based on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Outcome measures included health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL; Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form [SF-36v2]: mental and physical component summary [MCS and PCS]; Short-Form 6 Dimensions [SF-6D]; and EuroQol 5 Dimensions [EQ-5D]), work productivity and activity impair -ment (WPAI), and health resource utilization (HRU). Multivariate analysis was performed to examine group differences after adjusting covariates.Results: Respondents with depression diagnosis reported significantly higher rates of diagnosed anxiety and sleep problems versus those without depression (for both; P < 0.001). Adjusted MCS, PCS, SF-6D, and EQ-5D scores were significantly lower in respondents with depression versus those without depression (all P < 0.001). Consistently, respondents with depression reported higher absenteeism, presenteeism, and overall WPAI, as well as greater number of provider visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations compared with those without depression (all P < 0.001). Further, burden of each outcome increased with an increase in disease severity.Conclusions: Diagnosed depression was associated with lower health-related quality-of-life and work productivity, and higher healthcare utilization than those without depression, and burden increased with an increase in symp -tom severity. The results show the burden of depression remains high even among those experiencing minimal symptoms.\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:542 BackgroundDepression is a common mental disorder in the United States (US) [1]. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a form of depression, defined as the presence of \u2265 5 of the following symptoms in the same 2-week period (with \u2265 1 symptom being depressed mood or anhedonia): (1) depressed mood, (2) marked loss of interest or pleasure in everyday activities (anhedonia), (3) significant change in weight or change in appetite, (4) insomnia or hyper -somnia, (5) psychomotor agitation or retardation, (6) fatigue or loss of energy, (7) feelings of worthlessness or guilt, (8) diminished ability to think or concentrate, and (9) recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or suicide attempt [2]. Additional criteria that must be met for an MDD diagnosis are: the symptoms cause signifi -cant distress/impairment, the episode is not attributable to a substance\u2019s physiological effects, occurrence of epi -sode is not explained by other psychotic disorders, and absence of a manic episode/hypomanic-like episode [2]. According to the Global Burden of Disease study (1990 to 2017), the incident cases of MDD increased by 49.29% from 162 to 241 million globally [3]. As per the National Survey on Drug Use and Health report, 21.0 million adults had experienced \u2265 1 major depressive epi -sode in 2020, representing 8.4% of the adult population in the US; prevalence was higher among female adults than males and in individuals aged 18-49\u00a0years than those aged \u2265 50\u00a0years [4].Numerous studies have reported on the detrimental impact of MDD on overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in terms of interpersonal relationships, and psychological and physical functioning, noting that the psychological impairment can persist even after remis -sion of MDD symptoms [5 \u20139]. According to an analysis of quality of life (QoL) data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, < 3% of untreated patients with MDD reported \u201cwithin-normal\u201d QoL and approximately 50% of treated patients contin -ued to experience \u201cseverely-impaired\u201d QoL [9 ]. Moreo -ver, another analysis of the STAR*D trial data reported a decrease in both response and remission rates with each step of treatment [10].Further, previous studies have shown that depression affects work productivity [11] and increases healthcare resource utilization (HRU), leading to higher direct and indirect costs with increasing severity of depression [12, 13]. The economic burden in adults with MDD is high, with 37.9% increase ($237 billion to $326 billion) in all costs from 2010 to 2018 in the US [14]. This burden includes the costs attributed to not only MDD manage -ment (37.0%) but also comorbid conditions (63.0%) [14].A nationally representative survey (2012\u20132013) con -ducted in the US reported that among respondents with lifetime MDD (n = 7432), the lifetime prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorder was 37.3% and substance use disorder was 57.9% [15]. Patients with both MDD and anxiety disorders incur higher healthcare costs as com -pared to those with either disorder alone [16]. Consider -ing the humanistic and economic impact MDD has on an individual, it is important to not only treat depressive symptoms but also focus on improving overall QoL in the presence of comorbidities.Although previous studies have evaluated the burden of MDD on QoL [5 , 7\u20139], work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) [11\u2013 13], HRU [12], and health eco -nomic outcomes across depression severity groups [5 , 7, 12, 13], few studies to date have compared the outcomes of those without depression to those with depression or across various depression severity groups in a large sam -ple size in the US [12, 14]. Thus, there is a need for more recent data in the US population. The objective of this large, cross-sectional study was to evaluate the humanistic and economic burden of depression in the US by compar -ing outcomes (HRQoL, WPAI, and HRU) of respondents with depression diagnosis versus without depression diag -nosis and also across symptom severity groups.MethodsStudy design and\u00a0data sourceThis study was conducted using data from the 2017 US National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS; N = 75,004). The NHWS is a self-administered, internet-based survey of a sample of adults (aged \u2265 18\u00a0years) that provides \u201creal world\u201d patient-level information over 165 therapeutic conditions. Potential respondents for the survey are recruited through a general-purpose web-based consumer panel. The panel recruits its members via opt-in e-mails, co-registration with panel partners, e-newsletter campaigns, banner placements, and affiliate networks. All the respondents who explicitly agreed to be a panel member registered through a unique e-mail address and completed an in-depth demographic regis -tration profile. A quota sampling procedure (using data from the Current Population Survey of the US Census) was used to ensure that the final NHWS sample was representative of the US\u2019 adult population in 2017 with respect to age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Informed consent was obtained from all the respondents and all Keywords: Anxiety, Depression, Healthcare resource utilization, Quality of life, Sleep disorder, Work productivityPage 3 of 14 Jain\u00a0et\u00a0al.

The study protocol and questionnaire were reviewed by the Pearl Institutional Review Board and granted exemp -tion status.Study sampleRespondents aged 18-64\u00a0 years \u2018with depression diag -nosis\u2019 (n  = 8853) or \u2018without depression diagnosis\u2019 (n = 30,478) were included in the analysis. Respondents with depression diagnosis: those who self-reported physician diagnosis of depression and reported expe -riencing depression in the past 12\u00a0 months) [2 ]. These respondents were further stratified by severity of depres -sion as determined by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores: none/minimal (score = 0\u20134; n = 1876), mild (score = 5\u20139; n = 2801), moderate (score = 10\u201314; n = 1938), moderately severe (score = 15\u201319; n = 1376), or severe (score = 20\u201327; n = 862). Respondents with -out depression diagnosis: those who had no self-reported physician diagnosis of depression, reported not experiencing depression in the past 12\u00a0months, and had PHQ-9 scores \u2264 4 [17] (Fig.\u00a0 1). Respondents diagnosed with bipolar disorder and those who reported not expe -riencing depression in the past 12\u00a0months but had a diag -nosis were excluded from the study.MeasuresDemographics and\u00a0health characteristicsDemographic variables including age, gender, employ -ment status, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, household income, insurance status, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol use, exercise behav -ior, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were collected. The CCI represents a weighted sum of mul -tiple comorbid conditions predictive of mortality with greater scores indicating greater comorbid burden on the patient [18]. Disease-specific diagnoses includ -ing depression, anxiety, and sleep difficulties were also analyzed.Fig. 1 Eligible US NHWS sample for participants 18\u201364 years of ageaPatients with depression diagnosis were stratified by PHQ-9 score at time of survey.

BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:542 Depression symptoms, anxiety and\u00a0sleep problemsDepression symptoms assessed that prompted respond -ents to see their doctor included self-reported depressed mood and other emotional problems, changes in eat -ing and sleep patterns, mental changes (e.g., forgetful -ness, difficulty thinking, difficulty concentrating), and social and physical problems. Sleep problems including self-reported difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying awake, daytime sleepiness, leg cramps/leg problems, night sweats/hot flashes, and poor quality of sleep were evaluated. Anxiety was assessed according to the self-reported diagnoses of anxiety disorders and self-reported experiences of anxiety. Additionally, anxiety was measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale (Supplementary Table\u00a01 ) [19].Health\u2011related quality of\u00a0life (HRQoL) and\u00a0health utilitiesShort Form Survey Instrument version 2 (SF\u201136v2) HRQoL was assessed using the SF-36v2 [20], which is a multi -purpose, generic health status instrument comprised of 36 questions. The instrument is designed to report eight health domains (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bod -ily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health) and two summary scores (Physical Component Summary [PCS] and Mental Com -ponent Summary [MCS]). Each domain and PCS and MCS scores are normed to a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 for the US\u2019 population. Higher scores are indicative of better health status [20]. SF-36v2 related parameters were studied based on past 4\u00a0weeks health status. Additionally, health state utility index was calculated using the Short-Form 6 Dimensions (SF-6D) form. The SF-6D is a prefer -ence-based single index measure for health using general population values and provides scores on a theoretical 0\u20131 scale with higher scores indicating better health status [21].EuroQol 5\u2011Dimension Health Questionnaire The Euro -Qol 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) [21] consists of a descriptive system (EQ-5D) and a vis -ual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system is composed of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS (score: 0 to 100) indicates the respondent\u2019s self-rated health, with the endpoints being \u2019Best imaginable health state\u2019 (score = 100) and \u2019Worst imaginable health state\u2019 (score = 0). Lower overall scores on the EQ-5D-5L health utilities are indicative of higher disability. The most recent version with 5-point rating scales for each dimension was used in this study [22]. The EQ-5D-5L utility scores were calculated by mapping the five-level descriptive system (EQ-5D-5L) onto the three-level value set (EQ-5D-3L) using the mapping (\u201ccrosswalk\u201d) approach developed by van Hout et\u00a0al. [23]. Health states were mapped using country-specific value set.Work productivity and\u00a0activity impairment (WPAI)Work productivity loss was measured using the WPAI questionnaire [24], a six-item validated instrument which consists of four metrics: absenteeism (the percentage of work time missed because of one\u2019s health in the past seven days), presenteeism-related impairment (the per -centage of impairment experienced while at work in the past seven days because of one\u2019s health), overall work productivity loss (an overall impairment estimate that it is a combination of absenteeism and presenteeism), and activity impairment (the percentage of impairment in daily activities because of one\u2019s health in the past seven days). Only respondents who reported being employed full-time or part-time provided data for absenteeism, presenteeism, and overall work impairment; all respond -ents reported data for activity impairment.Health\u2011resource utilization (HRU)Healthcare utilization was defined by the number of healthcare provider (HCP) visits (e.g., general practi -tioner, internist, cardiologist, gynecologist, etc.), the number of emergency room (ER) visits, and the number of times hospitalized in the past six months. All outcome measures and scales [19\u201321, 24, 25] used in this study are detailed in Supplementary Table\u00a01.Statistical analysesChi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to determine the significant differences for categorical variables and continuous variables, respec -tively. These results served to characterize differences between respondents with and without a depression diagnosis as well as between no/minimal, mild, moder -ate, moderately severe, and severe diagnosed depres -sion and informed the selection of covariates for multivariable models.Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to con -trol for demographic, health characteristic and comor -bidity variables to compare HRQoL, WPAI, and HRU between respondents with and without a depression diagnosis and across symptom severity among respond -ents with a depression diagnosis. Only variables that were statistically significant in the bivariate analysis and had clinical importance were included in the regression models. GLMs with a negative binomial distribution were used for skewed data (e.g., WPAI and HRU).The covariates included in the multivariable models were: Age (continuous), gender (male vs. female), ethnic -ity (black, hispanic, other vs. white [reference]), marital Page 5 of 14 Jain\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:542  status (single, decline to answer vs. married/living with partner [reference]), education (less than college, decline to answer vs. college education [reference]), income (< 50\u00a0k, 50-75\u00a0k, decline to answer vs. 75\u00a0k + [reference]), employment (employed vs. not), insured (yes vs. no), BMI (underweight, overweight, obese [combined obese and morbidly obese], decline to answer vs. normal weight [reference]), smoking (former, current vs. never smoked), CCI, and individual comorbidities. The individual comor -bidities included: Diagnosed with anxiety, nasal allergies/hay fever, allergies, pain, hypertension, high cholesterol, migraine, generalized anxiety disorder, heartburn, social anxiety disorder, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, arthritis, panic disorder, acne, post-traumatic stress dis -order, urinary tract infection, irritable bowel syndrome, dry eye, sleep apnea, eczema, thyroid problem, diabetes, yeast infection, and bladder control condition.In bivariate analyses, comparisons were made for: (a) \u2018with depression diagnosis\u2019 versus \u2018without depression diagnosis\u2019 groups, and (b) across all severity groups using an overall omnibus test. In multivariable analyses, com -parisons were made for: (a) \u2018with depression diagnosis\u2019 group versus \u2018without depression diagnosis\u2019 group (ref -erence), and (b) mild, moderate, moderately severe, or severe groups versus \u2018no/minimal\u2019 symptoms severity group (reference). P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsThe NHWS total US adult population consisted of 75,004 respondents, of which 59,786 respondents were < 65\u00a0years old. Of these, respondents who self-reported bipolar disorder/screened positive on the mood disorder ques -tionnaire were excluded (n = 3322). Of the non-bipolar respondents (n = 56,464): (a) 15,419 respondents self-reported experiencing depression in the past 12\u00a0months, of which 8853 respondents reported diagnosed depres -sion; (b) 39,301 respondents did not self-report experi -encing depression in the past 12\u00a0months and reported no depression diagnosis, of which 30,478 respondents had PHQ-9 scores \u2264 4 and screened negative for MDD based on the PHQ-9; and (c) 1744 respondents did not self-report experiencing depression in the past 12\u00a0months but were diagnosed (at any point) (Fig.\u00a01).This study included a total of 39,331 eligible respond -ents (aged 18\u201364\u00a0years), consisting of 8853 respondents who reported depression diagnosis and 30,478 respond -ents who reported no depression diagnosis. Respond -ents with depression diagnosis were further stratified by PHQ-9 scores as indicated in Fig.\u00a0 1. Among these respondents, 47.2% had moderate to severe symptoms, 31.6% had mild symptoms, and 21.2% had no/minimal depression symptoms at the time of survey.Demographics and\u00a0health characteristicsData on the demographic and health characteristics, depression symptoms, anxiety and sleep problems, and prescription use for treating anxiety disorders or sleep problems collected from NHWS respondents are reported in Table\u00a0 1. Respondents with depression diag -nosis were more likely to be female, non-Hispanic white, single, have less than a college education, have lower annual household income, and less likely to be employed full-time than respondents without a depression diagno -sis (all P < 0.001) (Table\u00a0 1). Those with severe symptoms tended to be younger, female, single, have less than a col -lege education, have lower annual household income, and less likely to be employed full-time compared to those with no/minimal symptoms (all omnibus P < 0.001). Furthermore, respondents with severe symptoms also tended to be obese, less likely to exercise regularly, and have higher CCI scores compared to those with no/mini -mal symptoms (all omnibus P < 0.001).Depression symptoms and\u00a0anxiety and\u00a0sleep problemsThe most frequent depression symptoms reported by respondents with a depression diagnosis were depressed mood and other emotional problems (88.0%), followed by mental changes (e.g., forgetfulness, difficulty think -ing, difficulty concentrating; 49.0%), and sleep pat -tern changes (43.8%; Table\u00a0 1). A higher proportion of respondents with severe symptoms had depressed mood and other emotional problems (91.2% vs. 84.9%; P < 0.001), mental changes (59.7% vs. 39.9%; P < 0.001), and sleep pattern changes (42.6% vs. 38.9%; P < 0.001) compared to those with no/minimal symptoms.A significantly higher proportion of respondents with a depression diagnosis (total) were diagnosed with anxi -ety (73.2% vs. 5.5%; P < 0.001) and used prescription medications for anxiety (44.0% vs. 2.7%; P < 0.001) than respondents without depression diagnosis (Table\u00a0 1). A similar trend was observed in respondents with a depres -sion diagnosis (total) with regard to being diagnosed with sleep problems (any; 39.9% vs. 6.5%; P < 0.001) and use of prescription medications for sleep problems (17.4% vs. 2.3%; P < 0.001) compared to respondents with -out depression diagnosis (Table\u00a0 1). The proportion of respondents diagnosed with anxiety or any sleep prob -lems and using prescription medications for anxiety or sleep increased with increasing severity of depression.Mean GAD-7 scores were higher in respondents with a depression diagnosis (total) (8.0) as well as those with no/minimal symptoms (3.1) than respondents without depression diagnosis (1.16). GAD-7 scores increased (ie, worsened) with increasing severity of depression symp -toms (Table\u00a01).Page 6 of 14 Jain\u00a0et\u00a0al.

Respondents with severe depression symptoms reported significantly higher HRU compared to those with no/minimal symptoms (P < 0.050).DiscussionThe current study provides important insights into the humanistic and economic burden associated with diag -nosed depression in the US. The study findings demon -strate that notable differences exist in terms of symptom burden, QoL, WPAI, and HRU between respondents with depression diagnosis (self-reported) versus those without depression diagnosis, as well as across depres -sion groups based on severity.The sociodemographic characteristics of respondents with depression diagnosis correlated with previous stud -ies in terms of high prevalence in women and high rates of comorbidities, most notably anxiety, compared to those without depression diagnosis [26, 27]. In the cur -rent study, 73.2% of subjects with depression reported a diagnosis of anxiety, which is in line with previous research that reported significant anxiety in majority of patients with depression (85%) [27].In our study, of those respondents with depression diagnosis (n = 8853), 47.2% had moderate-to-severe symptoms and 21.2% had no/minimal symptoms of depression, at the time of the survey. Respondents with no/minimal symptoms of depression, as determined by the PHQ-9 scores at the time of survey, indicate poten -tial remission or that depression had resolved. How -ever, these respondents still reported a higher burden of anxiety and sleep issues than respondents without a depression diagnosis. These findings are consistent with published studies which indicate that patients\u2019 sympto -matic recovery could be misleading as they may continue to experience reduced QoL and disabling residual symp -toms, while in remission [9, 28\u201330].Consistent with previously published studies, respondents with depression diagnosis had poorer HRQoL (with lower scores on MCS, PCS, SF-6D, and EQ-5D scores) compared to those without depression diagnosis [7 , 31, 32]. In the STAR*D study approxi -mately 50% of the patients with depression reported experiencing \u201cseverely impaired\u201d QoL even after anti -depressant treatment [9 ]. The minimal important difference (MID) of 3 points on the MCS [33] was exceeded in the present study (with depression diagno -sis: 38.8; without depression diagnosis: 51.8; P  < 0.001), further confirming poorer mental health in respondents with depression; however, although PCS was signifi -cantly different between respondents with depression diagnosis versus without depression diagnosis (52.2 vs 52.8; P < 0.001), the MID of 3 points on the PCS [33] was not reached. Respondents with higher depressive symptom severity also reported a higher burden of ill -ness across various health indices as compared with the no/minimal symptom severity group. A similar trend was reported by a study in Europe that showed reduced HRQoL as assessed by SF-12 and the EQ-5D utility index scores in patients with MDD [5 ]. Taken together, the data are suggestive of the substantial humanistic burden and need for specific interventions to improve HRQoL in patients with depression.The current study also demonstrated that respondents with depression diagnosis reported greater work produc -tivity losses when employed than respondents without depression diagnosis. These results are in agreement with previously published data that demonstrated higher presen -teeism, absenteeism, overall work impairment, and activity impairment in those with depression versus those without depression [31, 34, 35]. We also observed higher presentee -ism than absenteeism in the current study, which is consist -ent with previous research [31], where presenteeism could be identified as the primary contributor to work productiv -ity loss. Further, studies by Beck et\u00a0 al. reported that even minimal levels of depression symptoms were associated with loss of work productivity [13, 36]. Our findings are in line with prior research that demonstrated increase in WPAI with the severity of the disease [12, 34, 36].In the current study, respondents with depression diag -nosis had a greater number of HCP visits, ER visits, and hospitalizations than those without depression diagno -sis. These findings are in accord with prior research that reported higher HRU in those with depression compared to controls [31, 32]. In our study, the frequency of hos -pitalizations and ER visits increased with increase in the severity of depression, similar to previous research [12]. Collectively these observations suggest that respondents with a depression diagnosis may incur higher direct and indirect costs than those without depression.Recently, research has shown the impact of the pan -demic on mental health, and the growing prevalence of depression [37, 38]. Thus, the treatment of depression has become an even more critical issue, from both humanis -tic and economic perspectives.Page 11 of 14 Jain\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:542  Study implicationsOur study findings confirm that individuals with depres -sion diagnosis have substantial humanistic and economic burden and provide unique insights into the varying bur -den experienced among individuals with different sever -ity of disease. This increases our understanding about the overall effect of depression on the HRQoL of patients as well as the burden of lost work productivity on employ -ers and increased resource utilization on payers. Substan -tially higher burden of illness even among respondents with minimal symptoms (vs. those without depression) is suggestive that they might not be exhibiting symp -toms on common and validated scales (such as PHQ-9 in this case). It is important to note that the evaluation of treatment efficacy typically focuses on depression symp -tom scales that are an important part of treatment, but do not fully capture patient-centric concepts related to well-being. Considering the impact that depression has on various aspects of patients\u2019 lives, there is an additional need to treat patients focusing on core symptom resolu -tion as well as overall and broader well-being, including functional improvement and minimizing residual symp -toms [29, 39\u201342]. Additionally, it is important to broaden the routine outcome monitoring systems [43] to effec -tively capture patients\u2019 experiences, perspectives, needs, and priorities and incorporating them into the treatment approach for better outcomes [42]. The combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy has already shown to improve QoL and work productivity in patients diag -nosed with depression [35, 44, 45]. Observations from this study provide insights for future research, while reinforcing the widespread need for novel, effective, and accessible treatment options for depression considering the negative impact of increasing depression severity on outcomes.Strengths and\u00a0limitationsThe sampling methodology utilized in the NHWS is designed to generate a representative sample of the US\u2019 general population. However, results from this study may not be generalizable to the US\u2019 population of patients diagnosed with depression. As an internet-based survey, similar to other patient-reported surveys, this approach likely underrepresents people with no access to or lack of comfort with online administration, less healthy elderly people, institutionalized patients, and those with low health literacy, severe comorbidities, and disabilities. The self-reported nature of the NHWS is also associated with potential corresponding biases such as recall and self-presentation biases. To reduce recall bias, shorter and recent timeframes for questions were chosen (e.g., HRU in the past 6\u00a0 months). Moreover, the survey con -tent was thoroughly reviewed with the study team to avoid any self-presentation bias. Physician records were not reviewed as part of the current study and therefore physician-diagnosed depression could not be verified. Thus, patients\u2019 self-reported diagnosis of depression was recorded, which may have created a bias in the results obtained. Further, associations between depression and outcomes (e.g., HRU, HRQoL) may be complex due to Table 2 HRU among respondents with depression versus without depression diagnosis and across severity groups \u2013 Multivariable resultsResults are based on generalized linear regression models controlling for demographics, health characteristics, and comorbidities as covariatesa Respondents with depression diagnosis: those who self-reported physician diagnosis of depression and reported experiencing depression in the past 12\u00a0monthsb Respondents without depression diagnosis: those who had no self-reported physician diagnosis of depression, reported not experiencing depression in the past 12\u00a0months, and had PHQ-9 scores \u2264 4* P-value < 0.050 for comparison vs \u2018no/minimal symptoms\u2019 severity group** P-value < 0.010 for comparison vs \u2018no/minimal symptoms\u2019 severity group\u2021 P-value < 0.001 for comparison vs \u2018without depression diagnosis\u2019 groupER Emergency room, HRU  Healthcare resource utilization, SE Standard errorHRU in the past 6\u00a0monthsRespondents without depression diagnosisbn = 30,478Respondents with depression diagnosisaTotal (all symptom levels)n = 8853No/minimal symptomsn = 1876Mild symptomsn = 2801Moderate symptomsn = 1938Moderately severe symptomsn = 1376Severe symptomsn = 862Healthcare provider visits, mean \u00b1 SE2.41 \u00b1 0.03 3.61 \u00b1 0.08\u20215.46 \u00b1 0.17 5.60 \u00b1 0.14 5.78 \u00b1 0.17 6.23 \u00b1 0.22** 6.50 \u00b1 0.3**ER visits, mean \u00b1 SE0.09 \u00b1 0 0.14 \u00b1 0.01\u20210.25 \u00b1 0.02 0.23 \u00b1 0.01 0.26 \u00b1 0.02 0.31 \u00b1 0.02* 0.34 \u00b1 0.03**Hospitalizations, mean \u00b1 SE0.04 \u00b1 0 0.08 \u00b1 0.01\u20210.11 \u00b1 0.01 0.10 \u00b1 0.01 0.11 \u00b1 0.01 0.13 \u00b1 0.02 0.16 \u00b1 0.02*Page 12 of 14 Jain\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:542 the presence of comorbidities, which might have affected the results; these effects were controlled by including potential comorbidities as covariates in the multivariable analyses. However, there may be other confounders not collected in the current study.PHQ-9, a well-validated and commonly used screening and monitoring scale, was used as one of the eligibility criteria and to classify the severity of depression. Previ -ously published studies stated that PHQ-9 can be consid -ered for screening but PHQ-9 scores above cut-off should be interpreted with caution or should be coupled with other assessment tools for definitive diagnosis in patients with major depression [46, 47]. Patients may rate high on the scale total score without having elevated core symp -toms of depression. Additionally, demographic, cultural, and religious backgrounds may impact how a patient answers certain questions. No strong causal conclusions can be drawn between MDD and outcomes due to the cross-sectional nature of this study. Hence, a longitudinal study would be needed to reduce bidirectional effects.ConclusionsThe overall study results demonstrate that respondents with depression diagnosis (self-reported) experienced lower HRQoL, higher WPAI, and greater HRU compared to those without depression diagnosis. The humanis -tic and economic burden of depression increased with severity of illness. Furthermore, the study results high -light that the burden of depression remains high, even among those experiencing minimal severity/symptoms of depression. Although such patients may show symp -tomatic relief/remission of symptoms, they continue to experience lower QoL compared to controls. These results indicate the need for novel and effective treat -ments that help improve patients\u2019 wellness and function -ing for this psychiatric disorder. Further, while treating patients, it is important to focus not only on the resolu -tion of depressive symptoms but also on the overall well-being, including functional improvement.AbbreviationsANOVA: Analysis of Variance; BMI: Body mass index; CCI: Charlson Comorbidity Index; EQ-5D-5L: EuroQol 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire; EQ VAS: EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale; ER: Emergency room; GAD-7: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale; GLMs: Generalized linear models; HCP: Healthcare provider; HRQoL: Health related quality of life; HRU: Healthcare resource utilization; MCS: Mental component summary; MDD: Major depressive disorder; MID: Minimal important difference; NHWS: National Health and Wellness Survey; PCS: Physi-cal component summary; PHQ-9: Patient Health Questionnaire-9; QoL: Quality of life; SF-36v2: Short Form Survey Instrument version 2; SF-6D: Short-Form-6 Dimensions; STAR*D: Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression; US: United States; WPAI: Work productivity and activity impairment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12888- 022- 04165-x.Additional file\u00a01: Supplementary Table\u00a01.
