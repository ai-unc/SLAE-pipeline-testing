Lira Yoon2&Jutta Joormann3Published online: 23 August 2015#Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015Abstract Difficulty regulating emotions following stressfulevents is a hallmark of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).Although individuals\u2019 ability to regulate their emotions is be-lieved to have direct consequences for both emotional andphysical wellbeing, few studies have examined the cardiovas-cular effects of different emotion regulation strategies in MDD.The current study is the first to examine the effects of twoemotion regulation strategies, co gnitive distraction and rumina-tion, on both self-reported sadness and respiratory sinus ar-rhythmia (RSA) in individuals with MDD and healthy controls(CTLs). Following a forced-failure stressor, participants wererandomly assigned to a rumination or cognitive distraction con-dition. As expected, rumination increased sadness and triggeredRSA withdrawal for both MDDs and CTLs. Interestingly, al-though cognitive distraction red uced sadness, it also triggeredRSA withdrawal. Moreover, cognitive distraction was associat-ed with greater RSA withdrawal for MDDs than CTLs. Thus,although depressed individuals are able to use cognitive distrac-tion to emotionally recover from stress, it may be associatedwith greater cognitive effort. Adding low-cost physiologicalmeasures such as RSA into assessments has the potential tooffer new and important information about the effects of emo-tion regulation on mental and physiological health.Keywords Depression .Stress .Emotion regulation .Respiratory sinus arrhythmia .Autonomic nervous systemExaggerated emotional and cardiovascular responses to stressare central characteristics of Major Depressive Disorder(MDD; e.g., Brown and Harris 1986; Lazarus and Folkman1984; Monroe and Hadjiyannakis 2002), and can have detri-mental effects on mental and physical wellbeing (for a reviewsee Grippo and Johnson 2009). In fact, an altered response tostress is a primary pathophysiological mechanism linkingMDD to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Althoughpast research has focused on individual differences in the ini-tial reactivity to stress, studies increasingly emphasize the im-portance of examining individuals \u2019ability to regulate theiremotions after the stressor ends (Flynn and Rudolph 2007;Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 2008). For example, models of stressand health posit that emotion regulation strategies are criticaldeterminants of emotional and cardiovascular wellbeing, par-ticularly for those with psychopathology (Brosschot et al.2006; Kubzansky et al. 2005). Despite this, little is knownabout the effects of using different emotion regulation strate-gies on cardiovascular activity in MDD.The parasympathetic nervous system plays an importantrole in regulating cardiovascular activity. More specifically,the parasympathetic nervous syst em influences oscillations inheart rate via its influence on the vagus nerve, which affectsheart rate acceleration and deceleration during respiration.Whereas vagal activity is temporarily suppressed during inha-lation, causing heart rate to increase, vagal activity resumesduring exhalation, causing heart rate to decrease. Greater para-sympathetic input leads to great er heart rate acceleration after *Joelle LeMoultjoelle.lemoult@gmail.comK.

Respiratorysinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been identified as an optimal mark-er of this beat-to-beat variation in heart rate linked to the respi-ratory cycle. RSA offers advantages over other measures of theparasympathetic nervous system (e.g., low-frequency heart ratevariability) given that it is unconfounded by sympathetic acti-vation (Berntson et al. 1993). RSA also has advantages overother measures of biological functioning. For one, RSA is rel-atively inexpensive in that the per subject cost of data collectionis minimal. RSA data collection is also far less invasive thanother methods for collecting biological data. In fact, with thedevelopment of technology to collect ambulatory RSA, it isincreasingly feasible to measure RSA data in applied researchand clinical settings with minimal or no disruption to the indi-vidual (Cullins et al. 2013;G o e d h a r te ta l . 2008;G r o s s m a net al. 2004).Given the advantages of collecting RSA data, it is not sur-prising that RSA is used frequently to index parasympatheticactivity (see Berntson et al. 2007, for an overview). Parasym-pathetic activity, and thus RSA, is high during times of rest,when energy expenditure is actively reduced (e.g., byinhibiting the sympathetic innervations of the heart; Lovalloand Thomas 2000; Rottenberg 2007). However, when envi-ronmental demands become more challenging, such as in atime of stress, this Bbrake ^(Rottenberg 2007) is rapidly with-drawn in order to meet environmental demands. Thus, adap-tive parasympathetic responses to stress trigger moderate RSAwithdrawal (Blair and Peters 2003;K r e i b i g 2010). RSA with-drawal allows autonomic changes that prime the body foraction and facilitate responses to environmental changes, in-cluding better executive functioning and social competence(Blair and Peters 2003;M a r c o v i t c he ta l . 2010). In contrastto adaptive physiological responses to stress, exaggerated re-activity or delayed recovery (evidenced by greater or longerRSA withdrawal) places the body under excessive strain andincreases risk for cardiovascular and other organic diseases(Crowell et al. 2013). To facilitate recovery, the body activatesthe parasympathetic nervous system, leading to increasedRSA. Individual differences in the use of emotion regulationstrategies may be associated with different amounts of para-sympathetic activation, and these differences may be particu-larly relevant for individuals with MDD, who are at greaterrisk for poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular dis-ease (Kiecolt-Glaser and Glaser 2002).Past research on emotion regulation and recovery fromstress in MDD focuses largely on self-reported sadness.Whereas adaptive emotion regulation strategies facilitate re-covery from stress, maladaptive emotion regulation strategiesprolong depressed mood. Distraction is typically consideredan adaptive emotion regulation strategy in the short-term giv-en that it decreases sadness and facilitates engagement inbehaviors that are likely to further improve mood (Donaldsonand Lam 2004; Watkins et al. 2000). Both healthy controlsand individuals with MDD are able to effectively down-regulate negative emotions when exposed to a distraction in-duction (for a review see Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 2008). Un-like healthy controls, however, individuals with MDD do notoften spontaneously engage in distraction in everyday life.This may be due, in part, to the fact that it is difficult fordepressed individuals to disengage from negative thoughts,resulting in an unproductive pattern of ruminative thinking(Joormann 2010; Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 1993). The responsestyles theory (Nolen-Hoeksema 1991; Nolen-Hoeksema et al.2008) defines rumination as repeatedly thinking about nega-tive feelings and the potential antecedents or repercussions ofthose feelings. In contrast to distraction, ruminative responsesto stress increase the duration and severity of depressed moods(Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 1993).Although the emotional consequences of rumination anddistraction have been well established (see Lyubomirsky andTkach 2004, and Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 2008, for reviews),less is known about the effects of these emotion regulationstrategies on RSA. Initial evidence indicates that both angerand depressive rumination are associated with parasympatheticwithdrawal (Key et al. 2008; Ottaviani et al. 2009), whereasdistraction is associated with parasympathetic activation (Gerinet al. 2006; Ottaviani et al. 2009; Ottaviani and Shapiro 2011).The majority of studies use passive distraction tasks, whichinvolve passively viewing neutral movies or images (Gerinet al. 2006) or overhearing a fabricated phone conversation(Ottaviani et al. 2009; Ottaviani and Shapiro 2011). By con-trast, other studies use cognitive distraction tasks, which re-quire greater cognitive control and demand. Cognitive distrac-tion has been shown to be effective at improving negativemood (Eisenberg and Morris 2003; Eisenberg et al. 2008).The effect of cognitive distraction on parasympathetic activity,however, is more uncertain and has not been examined inMDD.The primary goal of the current study was to compare clin-ically depressed and healthy control participants \u2019parasympa-thetic activity during a rumination and cognitive distraction in-duction. In the process, we hoped to demonstrate the importanceand feasibility of adding physiological measures to assessmentsof emotion regulation. In this study, participants were exposedto a forced-failure stressor, selected for its ability both to inducesad mood (Hammen 2005) and to trigger biological changes(Kirschbaum et al. 1993). Following the forced-failure task,participants were randomly assigned either to ruminate on theirpoor performance or to cognitively distract themselves from it.We measured RSA reactivity before and during the forced-failure and emotion regulation periods. Whereas we expectedrumination to be associated with RSA withdrawal in both theMDD and control groups, we expected cognitive distraction tobe associated with RSA activation in both groups.J Psychopathol Behav Assess (2016) 38:20 \u201329 21MethodParticipantsInclusion and exclusion criteria for the current study weredetermined via an in-person Structured Clinical Interviewfor DSM-IV (SCID; First et al. 2002), which was conductedby trained graduate students. Strong inter-rater reliability wasestablished, \u03ba=1.00. Participants were included if they werebetween the ages of 18 and 60 and were in one of two groups:those who met criteria for current major depressive disorder(MDD; n=47), and those who did not meet criteria for anypast or current Axis I disorder (Control: CTL; n=51). Partic-ipants were excluded due to severe head trauma, learning dis-abilities, bipolar disorder, psychotic symptoms, alcohol orsubstance abuse within the past 6 months, or medical condi-tions that would affect psychophysiological recordings (e.g.,heart murmur). Data from seven participants with MDD andfour CTLs could not be included due to excessive movementartefacts or signal error. Thus, the final sample included 40participants in the MDD group and 47 in the CTL group.Forced-Failure StressorThree forced-failure tasks were used to elicit distress. The firstwas a facial identification task with false feedback indicatingthat the participant performed poorly. This 10-min task wasadapted from Tran et al. ( 2011). Participants were asked toidentify the emotional expression (happy, sad, angry) depictedin subliminally presented facial expressions. Participants re-peatedly received feedback that they were performing poorlyrelative to others who had already completed the task, and theexperimenter urged participants to try harder. The second taskwas an anagram task, in which approximately 30 % of theanagrams were unsolvable. Participants were given 5 min tosolve as many anagrams as possible but allowed only 30 s tosolve each anagram. In the third task, participants were given5 min to count backward aloud from 2083 to zero in 13-stepsequences (Kirschbaum et al. 1993).Rumination and Distraction InductionParticipants were randomly assigned to either a rumination orcognitive distraction condition, which was adapted from thestandard rumination and distraction (R/D) task created byNolen-Hoeksema and Morrow ( 1993). Regardless of the con-dition, participants viewed seven prompts one-at-a-time on thecomputer screen, and they were asked to think and write abouteach prompt for 2 min. Rumination prompts focused partici-pants \u2019attention on thoughts that were emotion or self-focused(e.g., \u2018why your performance on the tests earlier today madeyou feel the way it did \u2019or\u2018what people would think of you ifthey had observed you complete the tests earlier today \u2019). Incontrast, cognitive distraction prompts focused participants \u2019attention on thoughts unrelated to the self (e.g., \u2018how to makea peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich. Describe it in detail, withas many steps as possible. \u2019or\u2018the layout of your local mall.Walk the entire length in your mind and describe the stores,things, or people you would see \u2019). Participants \u2019written state-ments were later coded based on Hilt and Pollak ( 2013)b ytwo independent raters who were blind to group and condi-tion. Rumination score ratings were made on a 5-point Likertscale ranging from 1 ( Not at all ruminating )t o5( Completelyruminating ), ICC=0.84.MeasuresSadness Ratings We examined sadness ratings assessed atfour points: at the end of the baseline period, in the middleof the forced-failure induction, immediately before the R/Dinduction, and immediately after the R/D induction. Partici-pants rated their sadness on an 11-point Likert-scale rangingfrom 0 ( not at all )t o1 0( very much ). We focused on sadnessas opposed to other metrics of affect (e.g., general negativeaffect) given that sadness is central to MDD, a common re-sponse to forced-failure stressors (Hammen 2005 ), and theaffective dimension most directly targeted by our ruminationinduction (Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow 1993).Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) Electrocardiograph(ECG) and respiration frequency were recorded with acomputer-based data acquisition system (MP150, Biopac Sys-tems). Three standard electrodes were attached bilaterally toparticipants \u2019left and right upper rib cage and right collarbone.To measure respiration frequency, a strain-gauge transducerbelt was attached around the chest above the ribcage and be-low the bust. Data was collected using BIOPAC bioamplifiers.The ECG and respiration frequency signals were sampled at arate of 1000 Hz, digitized with a 16-bit analog-to-digital con-verter, and processed using AcqKnowledge and MindWaresoftware. Following recommendations of the Task Force ofthe European Society of Cardiology and the North AmericanSociety of Pacing and Electrophysiology ( 1996), we used afrequency domain measure of heart rate variability, namelyRSA. Thus, vagal activation was indexed by measuring heartrate variability in the frequency band between 0.14 and 0.4 Hz(high frequency- heart rate variability). R-wave markers in theECG signal were evaluated for artifacts by visual inspectionand the MAD/MED artifact detection algorithm implementedin MindWare software (Mindware Heart Rate Variability Ap-plication, version 2.51; Mindware Technologies Ltd.). Identi-fied artifacts were then manually corrected. Beat-to-beat inter-val series were obtained from the ECG and converted intotime series of instantaneous beat-to-beat intervals with a res-olution of 4 Hz. Spectral analysis using the Welch methoddetermined the power spectral density in the frequency band22 J Psychopathol Behav Assess (2016) 38:20 \u201329between 0.14 and 0.4 Hz. This value is then automatically log-transformed to correct for the non-normal distribution, andminute-by-minute estimates of RSA were determined. Thisapproach accords with best-practice guidelines for frequencydomain methods to calculate RSA (Berntson et al. 1993; TaskForce of the European Society of Cardiology and the NorthAmerican Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology 1996 ).Data were then analyzed in 5-min increments, or as close tothis interval as tasks would allow. Specifically, RSAwas mea-sured during the following four periods: 1. During the 5-minnature video (baseline), which occurred immediately beforethe forced-failure stressor; 2. During the first 5 min of theforced-failure stressor; 3. During the 5 min immediately be-fore the R/D induction, when participants were completing theforced-failure stressor (approximately 15 \u201320 min after theforced-failure onset); and 4. During the first 6 min of the R/D induction (i.e., during the first three R/D prompts).Questionnaires Participants completed the Beck DepressionInventory-II (BDI; Beck et al. 1996), a 21-item measureassessing depressive symptom severity ( \u03b1=0.97). Additional-ly, participants completed the Ruminative Responses Scale ofthe Response Style Questionnaire (RRS; Nolen-Hoeksemaand Morrow 1991), a 22-item self-report questionnaireassessing individual differences in the tendency to ruminatewhen sad ( \u03b1=0.99).ProcedureAfter participants provided informed consent, approximately5 min were taken to attach psychophysiological equipmentand ensure the accurate collection of RSA data. Participantsthen watched a 5-min nature video followed by the forced-failure stressor. Next, participants were randomly assigned tothe rumination or cognitive distraction condition of the R/Dinduction. Before leaving the laboratory, participants watcheda calming nature video in order to provide ample time formood to return to baseline. Participants completed demo-graphic and clinical questionnaires at the end of theexperiment.Data AnalysisAnalyses were conducted with SPSS version 20.0. Baselineand demographic data were analyzed via one-way analysis ofvariance (ANOV A) and chi square tests. To examine the effectof the forced-failure stressor and R/D induction on self-reported sadness and RSA, we examined the changes in sad-ness and RSA as a result of the forced-failure stressor and R/Dinduction. For example, sadness reactivity to the forced-failure stressor was calculated as sadness rated during theforced-failure induction minus sadness at baseline. Sadnessreactivity to the R/D induction was calculated as sadness ratedafter the R/D induction minus sadness immediately before theR/D induction. Positive scores indicate increases in sadness;negative scores indicate decreases in sadness. Similarly, RSAreactivity during the forced-failure stressor was calculated asRSA measured during the first 5 min of the forced-failurestressor minus RSA measured during the 5 min immediatelybefore the forced-failure stressor. RSA reactivity during the R/D induction was calculated as RSA measured during the first6 min of the R/D induction minus RSA measured during the5 min immediately before the R/D induction. Positive scoresindicate RSA activation; negative scores indicate RSA with-drawal. Univariate ANOVAs were used to examine reactivityand recovery scores by group (MDD, CTL) and condition(rumination, cognitive distraction).ResultsParticipant and Baseline CharacteristicsDemographic and clinical data are presented in Table 1. Therewas no significant difference in ethnicity across group or con-dition, \u03c72s(1,N=86)<1, and ethnicity did not significantlydiffer by group within the rumination, \u03c72s(1,N=43)<1, orcognitive distraction conditions, \u03c72s(1,N=43)<1, ps>.05.Age also did not significantly differ across groups or condi-tions, Fs(1, 83)<1, and age did not significantly differ bygroup within the rumination, t(42)=1.66, or cognitive distrac-tion conditions, t(41)=1.40, ps>.05.

As expected, BDI (depressive symptoms), RRS (traitrumination), and baseline sadness ratings were significantlyhigher in the MDD versus CTL group, F(1, 82)>39.19, ps<.001. Scores, however, did not differ by R/D condition, andthe group by condition interaction was not significant, Fs(1,82)<1, ps>.05. Baseline RSA did not differ by group or con-dition, and the group by condition interaction was not signif-icant, Fs(1, 83)<1, ps>.05.R/D Induction Manipulation CheckParticipants \u2019written responses during the R/D induction werecoded for the extent to which they were ruminating (seeRumination Score in Table 1). There was a main effect of R/Dc o n d i t i o n , F(1, 82)=76.38, p<.001, \u03b72=0.48, and a maineffect of diagnostic group, F(1, 82)=22.13, p<.001, \u03b72=0.21.However, these main effects were qualified by a significantgroup by condition interaction, F(1, 82)=15.01, p<.001, \u03b72=0.16. Although MDDs in the rumination condition receivedJ Psychopathol Behav Assess (2016) 38:20 \u201329 23higher rumination scores than CTLs in the rumination condi-tion, F(1, 42)=21.31 ,p<.001, rumination scores did not differbetween MDDs and CTLs in the cognitive distraction condi-tion, F(1, 40)=1.70, p>.05. Importantly, individuals assignedto the rumination condition received higher rumination scoresthan participants in the cognitive distraction condition in boththe MDD, F(1, 40)=54.25, p<.001, \u03b72=0.59, and CTL group,F(1, 44)=18.73, p<.001, \u03b72=0.30.Self-Reported SadnessSelf-reported sadness was examined to ensure the forced-failure induction and R/D induction had the anticipated effects(see Fig. 1). As expected, compared to CTLs, the MDD groupreported greater sadness reactivity to the forced-failure stress-or,F(1, 81)=7.36, p<.01, \u03b72=0.08. Sadness reactivity to thefailure stressor did not significantly differ by R/D condition,and the group by condition interaction was not significant,F(1, 81)<1, ps>.05, \u03b72<0.01, suggesting that random assign-ment was effective. Sadness reactivity to the R/D inductiondid not differ by group, F(1, 81)<1, p>.05, \u03b72<0.01. How-ever, individuals in the cognitive distraction and ruminationcondition differed in their emotional response to the R/D in-duction, F(1, 81)=6.20, p<.05, \u03b72=0.07. As was anticipated,participants \u2019self-reported sadness decreased in the cognitivedistraction condition but increased in the rumination condi-tion. The group by condition interaction was not significant,F(1, 81)=2.04, p>.05, \u03b72=0.03.RSAWe first conducted a repeated-measures ANOVA withdiagnostic-group and R/D condition as the between-subjectfactors and time as the within-subject factor. This yielded amain effect of time, F(3, 249)=15.51, p<.001, \u03b72=0.16,which was qualified by the interaction between diagnosticgroup, R/D condition, and time at the cubic level, F(1, 83)=3.81, p=.05, \u03b72=0.04. No other main or interaction effectswere significant, ps>.05. Follow-up tests conducted on RSAchange scores indicated that, as expected, there was a signif-icant RSA withdrawal in response to the forced-failure stress-or,t(86)=2.64, p=.01 (see Fig. 2). Importantly, RSA changeduring forced-failure induction did not significantly differ bygroup or condition, and the group by condition interaction wasnot significant, Fs(1, 83)<1, ps>.05, \u03b72<0.01.We examined RSA change during the R/D induction to testour main hypotheses. Across conditions, there was a signifi-cant RSA withdrawal during the R/D induction, t(86)=6.10,p<.001.

To the best of our knowledge, the currentstudy is the first to examine whether clinically depressed andhealthy control participants display different affective andparasympathetic responses to a rumination and cognitive dis-traction induction. As expected, rumination increased sadnessand triggered RSA withdrawal for both MDDs and CTLs.Interestingly, although cognitive distraction reduced sadness,it also triggered RSAwithdrawal. Moreover, cognitive distrac-tion was associated with greater RSA withdrawal for MDDsthan CTLs. For MDDs, RSA withdrawal was also greaterduring cognitive distraction than rumination.RSA withdrawal during rumination is in line with numerousstudies reporting that both anger and depressive rumination isassociated with less parasympathetic activation in analoguesamples (e.g., Gerin et al. 2006; Key et al. 2008; Ottavianiet al. 2009). It also parallels the broader literature, which findscardiovascular activation during perseverative thinking \u2013in-cluding worry, rumination, or trauma recall \u2013in analogue sam-ples (Brosschot et al. 2006; Verkuil et al. 2009). Our data ex-tend this literature by comparing clinically depressed andhealthy control participants: Results demonstrate that the effectof rumination on RSA withdrawal did not significantly differbetween MDDs and CTLs. This finding is relevant to modelsof cardiovascular disease that include rumination as a mecha-nism through which MDD heightens risk for cardiovascularmorbidity and mortality (Brosschot et al. 2006; Rozanskiet al. 1999; Rugulies 2002). More specifically, results fromour study suggest that depressed individuals may be at height-ened risk for cardiovascular disease not because rumination hasa greater effect on RSA in MDDs than in CTLs, but becauseMDDs spend more time using an em otion regulation strategythat is associated with parasympathetic withdrawal. Given thatrumination produced similar RSA withdrawal in the MDD andCTL groups, models of cardiovascular risk might include notonly the cardiovascular effects of rumination but also the fre-quency with which individuals ruminate in everyday life.In addition, the current study examined the effects of cogni-tive distraction on RSA and found RSA withdrawal instead ofRSA activation. Our results stand in contrast to observations ofcardiovascular recovery during pa ssive distraction (e.g., Gerinet al. 2006; Ottaviani et al. 2008,2009). For example, cardio-vascular recovery from stress \u2013indexed via increased parasym-pathetic activity or decreased sympathetic activity \u2013has beenobserved when passively viewing neutral pictures and posters(Gerin et al. 2006) or when distracted by overhearing a fabri-cated phone conversation (Ottaviani et al. 2008, 2009 ;Ottaviani and Shapiro 2011). An important difference between1Including sex as a covariate did not affect the significant diagnosticgroup by R/D condition interaction, F(1, 79)=6.76, p=.01, \u03b72=0.08.There were no significant main or interactive effects with sex, Fs<1.Fig. 2 Change in RSA inresponse to the forced-failurestressor and emotion regulationinduction in CTLs and MDDs inthe rumination and distractioncondition.

In fact, it is this effort that has been posited to driveparasympathetic withdrawal during cognitive tasks (Luft et al.2009; Reynard et al. 2011). Interestingly, greater effort has longbeen associated with parasympathetic withdrawal (Lundberg andFrankenhaeuser 1980). Moreover, evidence from other experi-mental paradigms shows that tasks requiring cognitive effort leadto parasympathetic withdrawal (Duschek et al. 2009;L u f te ta l .2009; Reynard et al. 2011; Verkuil et al. 2009; although see alsoButler et al. 2006, and Segerstrom and Nes 2007, for evidence ofparasympathetic activation). For example, studies report lessparasympathetic activity when pa rticipants control the contentof thoughts by thinking and writing about an assigned topiccompared to baseline parasympathetic activity (Reynard et al.2011) or when participants think about moral questions ( BIs itappropriate for your friend to mis represent his curriculum vitaein order to get a job? ^;V e r k u i le ta l . 2009). Luft et al. ( 2009)a l s oreported lower parasympathetic activity during tasks requiringhigh versus low cognitive effort. More specifically, greater para-sympathetic withdrawal was observed during a one-back work-ing memory task compared to a simple reaction time task.We also observed greater RSA withdrawal during cognitivedistraction in the MDD versus CTL group. Given evidenceconnecting effort and parasympathetic withdrawal (Lundbergand Frankenhaeuser 1980 ), greater RSA withdrawal in theMDD group could reflect greater effort required for depressedindividuals to enga ge in cognitive distraction followingsadness-inducing failure. This interpretation is in line with be-havioral data showing that depressed participants are slower todisengage from negative material (see reviews by Gotlib andJoormann 2010; Joormann 2010;K o s t e re ta l . 2011). It is fur-ther supported by evidence that depressed individuals showgreater activation in brain regi ons subserving cognitive control(dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the insula) when removingnegative material from working memory (Foland-Ross et al.2013). Furthermore, during cognitive distraction, individualswith remitted depression exhibited increased neural activitycompared to healthy controls in the regulating control-network,including the anterior c ingulate (Kanske et al. 2012). The ideaof cognitive effort leading to parasympathetic withdrawal isalso in line with research showing lower parasympathetic ac-tivity in other clinical groups when using adaptive, yet effortful,emotion regulation strategies (Aldao and Mennin 2012). Spe-cifically, Aldao and Mennin found that individuals with gener-alized anxiety disorder exhibited lower parasympathetic activ-ity when using acceptance or reappraisal to regulate their emo-tions compared to when passively viewing a film. Importantly,in the current study, despite group differences in parasympa-thetic withdrawal during cognitive distraction, both healthycontrols and clinically depressed participants were able to usedistraction to repair the sad mood that was induced during theforced-failure period. Thus, although cognitive distractionappears to facilitate emotional recovery from stress, it may beassociated with greater cognitive effort for individuals withMDD. In fact, for individuals with MDD, RSA withdrawalwas even greater during cognitive distraction than rumination,further emphasizing the effort required for this population toengage in cognitive distraction. The fact that we observed adifferent pattern of findings for RSA and self-reported affectin the MDD versus CTL group underscores the importance ofadding physiological measures to clinical assessments.It is also noteworthy that, in this study, baseline RSA didnot differ between MDD and CTL participants. Interestingly,the literature on baseline RSA in depression is mixed. Where-as some studies report lower RSA levels in depressed com-pared to control participants (Dalack and Roose 1990;L e h o f e retal.1999; Rottenberg et al. 2007), others report no differ-ences in RSA levels (e.g., Lehofer et al. 1997; Moser et al.1998 ). Although a meta-analysis conducted by Rottenberg(2007) found that depression was associated with lower levelsof resting RSA ( d=0.33), only 6 of the 39 comparisons indi-cated a significant difference between depressed and controlparticipants, and depression accounted for only about 2 % ofthe variance in RSA. Moreover, Rottenberg ( 2007) concludesthat the overall effect of depression on RSA likely reflects anupper-bound estimate that may be very modest after account-ing for confounds and unpublished studies, thereby castingdoubt on the effects of depression on baseline RSA. Whenincorporating our findings on baseline RSA into the broaderliterature, it is important to consider the fact that we measuredbaseline RSAwhile participants were watching a calming naturevideo, which may have served as a passive distraction task,which has been shown to increase parasympathetic activity(Gerin et al. 2006; Ottaviani et al. 2009; Ottaviani and Shapiro2011). We, therefore, caution against direct comparison betweenbaseline RSA measured in the current study with that measuredin studies where participants are not engaging in any activity.The current study has several limitations. For one, comorbidhealth conditions were determined based on participants \u2019selfreport, and it is possible that participants may have been un-aware of prior cardiovascular c onditions that would have affect-ed RSA. However, using reactivity and recovery, as opposed toraw scores, minimized external sources of variability. Nonethe-less, future work might consider including a physical checkup.Future studies might also include additional measures of cardio-vascular health, including blood pressure or pre-ejection period(PEP). A second limitation is that the current study did notdirectly assess self-reported effort, which prevents us fromdrawing a direct connection between effort and parasympatheticwithdrawal during the cognitive d istraction induction. Lastly,despite random assignment to the cognitive distraction and ru-mination conditions, there was an unequal proportion of femaleparticipants across cells. Importantly, however, the group bycondition interaction on RSA recovery remained significantwhen sex was included in the model.26 J Psychopathol Behav Assess (2016) 38:20 \u201329Despite these limitations, the current study offers a uniqueexamination of parasympathetic activity during a ruminationand cognitive distraction induction in clinically depressedversus healthy control participants. Findings demonstrate thatthe effect of rumination on RSA did not significantly differbetween the MDD and CTL groups. In addition, the currentstudy provides the first evidence of the effects of cognitivedistraction on RSA in MDD. Our results demonstrate thatdistraction leads to greater parasympathetic withdrawal,indexed via RSA withdrawal, for MDDs than CTLs, whichmay reflect that depressed individuals require additional ef-fort to disengage from negative material. We hope that thisstudy also demonstrates the importance and feasibility of in-corporating physiological measures into assessments of emo-tion regulation. Assessing RSA activity can provide informa-tion about parasympathetic activation that cannot be obtainedfrom self-report measures. Thus, information on RSA couldhelp understand the effects of different emotion regulationstrategies on patients \u2019physical health, which is especiallyrelevant for patients with comorbid health conditions. In ad-dition, to the extent that RSA withdrawal indexes cognitiveeffort, examining changes in RSA during cognitive distrac-tion may prove a useful tool to assess skill integration astreatment progresses. With practice, cognitive distractionshould become less effortful for depressed individuals, lead-ing to less RSA withdrawal. These assessment options arepossible given that RSA provides a low-cost physiologicalmeasure that can be assessed with minimal disruption in ap-plied research and clinical settings. With the development ofdevices to collect ambulatory RSA, barriers to data collectionhave decreased even further. Future work might examineparasympathetic activation during other emotion regulationstrategies, including the use of emotion regulation strategiesin naturalistic settings. Additionally, investigators conductingresearch in applied or clinical settings might test whetherparasympathetic withdrawal during cognitive distraction de-creases with treatment or practice.Acknowledgments This work was supported by grant F31-MH086246.Conflicts of Interest Joelle LeMoult, K.
