Following a forced-failure stressor, participants were\nrandomly assigned to a rumination or cognitive distraction con-\ndition. As expected, rumination increased sadness and triggered\nRSA withdrawal for both MDDs and CTLs. Interestingly, al-\nthough cognitive distraction reduced sadness, it also triggered\nRSA withdrawal. Moreover, cognitive distraction was associat-\ned with greater RSA withdrawal for MDDs than CTLs. Thus,\nalthough depressed individuals are able to use cognitive distrac-\ntion to emotionally recover from stress, it may be associated\nwith greater cognitive effort.

In fact, an altered response to\nstress is a primary pathophysiological mechanism linking\nMDD to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although\npast rescarch has focused on individual differences in the ini-\ntial reactivity to stress, studies increasingly emphasize the im-\nportance of examining individuals’ ability to regulate their\nemotions after the stressor ends (Flynn and Rudolph 2007;\nNolen-Hoeksema et al. 2008). For example, models of stress\nand health posit that emotion regulation strategies are critical\ndeterminants of emotional and cardiovascular wellbeing, par-\nticularly for those with psychopathology (Brosschot et al.\n2006; Kubzansky et al. 2005). Despite this, little is known\nabout the effects of using different emotion regulation strate-\ngies on cardiovascular activity in MDD.\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system plays an important\nrole in regulating cardiovascular activity. More specifically,\nthe parasympathetic nervous system influences oscillations in\nheart rate via its influence on the vagus nerve, which affects\nheart rate acceleration and deceleration during respiration.\nWhereas vagal activity is temporarily suppressed during inha-\nlation, causing heart rate to increase, vagal activity resumes\nduring exhalation, causing heart rate to decrease. Greater para-\nsympathetic input leads to greater heart rate acceleration after\n\n\nJ Psychopathol Behav Assess (2016) 38:20-29\n\n21\n\ninhalation and greater heart rate deceleration after exhalation.\n‘Thus, greater parasympathetic activity is associated with great-\ner variability in the interval between heartbeats. Respiratory\nsinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been identified as an optimal mark-\ner of this beat-to-beat variation in heart rate linked to the respi-\nratory cycle. RSA offers advantages over other measures of the\nparasympathetic nervous system (c.g., low-frequency heart rate\nvariability) given that it is unconfounded by sympathetic acti-\nvation (Bemtson ct al. 1993). RSA also has advantages over\nother measures of biological functioning. For one, RSA is rel-\natively inexpensive in that the per subject cost of data collection\nis minimal. RSA data collection is also far less invasive than\nother methods for collecting biological data. In fact, with the\ndevelopment of technology to collect ambulatory RSA, it is\nincreasingly feasible to measure RSA data in applied rescarch\nand clinical settings with minimal or no disruption to the indi-\nvidual (Cullins et al. 2013; Goedhart et al. 2008; Grossman\netal. 2004).\n\nGiven the advantages of collecting RSA data, it is not sur-\nprising that RSA is used frequently to index parasympathetic\nactivity (see Berntson et al. 2007, for an overview). Parasym-\npathetic activity, and thus RSA, is high during times of rest,\nwhen energy expenditure is actively reduced (c.g., by\ninhibiting the sympathetic innervations of the heart; Lovallo\nand Thomas 2000; Rotenberg 2007). However, when envi-\nronmental demands become more challenging, such as in a\ntime of stress, this “brake” (Rottenberg 2007) is rapidly with-\ndrawn in order to meet environmental demands. Thus, adap-\ntive parasympathetic responses to stress trigger moderate RSA\nwithdrawal (Blair and Peters 2003; Kreibig 2010). RSA with-\ndrawal allows autonomic changes that prime the body for\naction and facilitate responses to environmental changes, in-\ncluding better exceutive functioning and social competence\n(Blair and Peters 2003; Marcovitch et al. 2010). In contrast\nto adaptive physiological responses to stress, exaggerated re-\nactivity or delayed recovery (evidenced by greater or longer\nRSA withdrawal) places the body under excessive strain and\nincreases risk for cardiovascular and other organic discases\n(Crowell etal. 2013). To facilitate recovery, the body activates\nthe parasympathetic nervous system, leading to increased\nRSA. Individual differences in the use of emotion regulation\nstrategies may be associated with different amounts of para-\nsympathetic activation, and these differences may be particu-\nlarly relevant for individuals with MDD, who are at greater\nrisk for poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular dis-\ncase (Kiccolt-Glaser and Glaser 2002).\n\nPast research on emotion regulation and recovery from\nstress in MDD focuses largely on self-reported sadness.\nWhereas adaptive emotion regulation strategies facilitate re-\ncovery from stress, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies\nprolong depressed mood. Distraction is typically considered\nan adaptive emotion regulation strategy in the short-term giv-\nen that it decreases sadness and facilitates engagement in\n\nbehaviors that are likely to further improve mood (Donaldson\nand Lam 2004; Watkins et al. 2000). Both healthy controls\nand individuals with MDD are able to effectively down-\nregulate negative emotions when exposed to a distraction in-\nduction (for a review see Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 2008). Un-\nlike healthy controls, however, individuals with MDD do not\noften spontancously engage in distraction in everyday life.\nThis may be due, in part, to the fact that it is difficult for\ndepressed individuals to disengage from negative thoughts,\nresulting in an unproductive pattern of ruminative thinking\n(Joormann 2010; Nolen-Hocksema et al. 1993). The response\nstyles theory (Nolen-Hoeksema 1991; Nolen-Hoeksema ct al.\n2008) defines rumination as repeatedly thinking about nega-\ntive feelings and the potential antecedents or repercussions of\nthose feelings. In contrast to distraction, ruminative responses\nto stress increase the duration and severity of depressed moods\n(Nolen-Hocksema ct al. 1993).\n\nAlthough the emotional consequences of rumination and\ndistraction have been well established (see Lyubomirsky and\nTkach 2004, and Nolen-Hocksema et al. 2008, for reviews),\nless is known about the effects of these emotion regulation\nstrategies on RSA. Initial evidence indicates that both anger\nand depressive rumination are associated with parasympathetic\nwithdrawal (Key et al. 2008; Ottaviani et al. 2009), whereas\ndistraction is associated with parasympathetic activation (Gerin\net al. 2006; Ottaviani et al. 2009; Ottaviani and Shapiro 2011).\nThe majority of studies use passive distraction tasks, which\ninvolve passively viewing neutral movies or images (Gerin\nct al. 2006) or overhearing a fabricated phone conversation\n(Ottaviani et al. 2009; Ottaviani and Shapiro 2011). By con-\ntrast, other studies use cognitive distraction tasks, which re-\nquire greater cognitive control and demand. Cognitive distrac-\ntion has been shown to be effective at improving negative\nmood (Eisenberg and Morris 2003; Eisenberg et al. 2008).\nThe effect of cognitive distraction on parasympathetic activity,\nhowever, is more uncertain and has not been examined in\nMDD.\n\n‘The primary goal of the current study was to compare clin-\nically depressed and healthy control participants’ parasympa-\nthetic activity during a rumination and cognitive distraction in-\nduction. In the process, we hoped to demonstrate the importance\nand feasibility of adding physiological measures to assessments\nof emotion regulation. In this study, participants were exposed\nto a forced-failure stressor, selected for ts ability both to induce\nsad mood (Hammen 2005) and to trigger biological changes\n(Kirschbaum ct al. 1993). Following the forced-failure task,\nparticipants were randomly assigned either to ruminate on their\npoor performance or to cognitively distract themselves from it.\nWe measured RSA reactivity before and during the forced-\nfailure and emotion regulation periods. Whereas we expected\nrumination to be associated with RSA withdrawal in both the\nMDD and control groups, we expected cognitive distraction to\nbe associated with RSA activation in both groups.\n\n4) Springer\n\n\n22\n\nJ Psychopathol Behav Assess (2016) 38:20-29\n\nMethod\nParticipants\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria for the current study were\ndetermined via an in-person Structured Clinical Interview\nfor DSM-IV (SCID; First et al. 2002), which was conducted\nby trained graduate students. Strong inter-rater reliability was\nestablished, k=1.00. Participants were included if they were\nbetween the ages of 18 and 60 and were in one of two groups:\nthose who met criteria for current major depressive disorder\n(MDD; n=47), and those who did not meet criteria for any\npast or current Axis I disorder (Control: CTL; n=51). Partic-\nipants were excluded due to severe head trauma, leaming dis-\nabilities, bipolar disorder, psychotic symptoms, alcohol or\nsubstance abuse within the past 6 months, or medical condi-\ntions that would affect psychophysiological recordings (c.g.\nheart murmur). Data from seven participants with MDD and\nfour CTLs could not be included due to excessive movement\nartefacts or signal error. Thus, the final sample included 40\nparticipants in the MDD group and 47 in the CTL group.\n\nForced-Failure Stressor\n\nThree forced-failure tasks were used to elicit distress. The first\nwas a facial identification task with false feedback indicating\nthat the participant performed poorly. This 10-min task was\nadapted from Tran ct al. (2011). Participants were asked to\nidentify the emotional expression (happy, sad, angry) depicted\nin subliminally presented facial expressions. Participants re-\npeatedly received feedback that they were performing poorly\nrelative to others who had already completed the task, and the\nexperimenter urged participants to try harder. The second task\nwas an anagram task, in which approximately 30 % of the\nanagrams were unsolvable. Participants were given 5 min to\nsolve as many anagrams as possible but allowed only 30's to\nsolve each anagram. In the third task, participants were given\n5 min to count backward aloud from 2083 to zero in 13-step\nsequences (Kirschbaum et al. 1993).\n\nRumination and Distraction Induction\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to cither a rumination or\ncognitive distraction condition, which was adapted from the\nstandard rumination and distraction (R/D) task created by\nNolen-Hoeksema and Morrow (1993). Regardless of the con-\ndition, participants viewed seven prompts one-at-a-time on the\ncomputer screen, and they were asked to think and write about\ncach prompt for 2 min. Rumination prompts focused partici-\npants’ attention on thoughts that were emotion or self-focused\n(e.g, ‘why your performance on the tests carlier today made\nyou feel the way it did” or ‘what people would think of you if\nthey had observed you complete the tests earlier today’). In\n\n4) Springer\n\ncontrast, cognitive distraction prompts focused participants’\nattention on thoughts unrelated to the self (¢.g., ‘how to make\na peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich. Describe it in detail, with\nas many steps as possible.” or ‘the layout of your local mall.\nWalk the entire length in your mind and describe the stores,\nthings, or people you would sce). Participants’ written state-\nments were later coded based on Hilt and Pollak (2013) by\ntwo independent raters who were blind to group and condi-\ntion. Rumination score ratings were made on a S-point Likert\nscale ranging from 1 (Not at all ruminating) to 5 (Completely\nruminating), ICC=0.84.\n\nMeasures\n\nSadness Ratings We examined sadness ratings assessed at\nfour points: at the end of the baseline period, in the middle\nof the forced-failure induction, immediately before the R/D\ninduction, and immediately after the R/D induction. Partici-\npants rated their sadness on an 11-point Likert-scale ranging\nfrom 0 (not at all) to 10 (very much). We focused on sadness\nas opposed to other metrics of affect (c.g., general negative\naffect) given that sadness is central to MDD, a common re-\nsponse to forced-failure stressors (Hammen 2005), and the\naffective dimension most directly targeted by our rumination\ninduction (Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow 1993).\n\nRespiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) Electrocardiograph\n(ECG) and respiration frequency were recorded with a\ncomputer-based data acquisition system (MP150, Biopac Sys-\ntems). Three standard electrodes were attached bilaterally to\nparticipants” left and right upper rib cage and right collarbone.\nTo measure respiration frequency, a strain-gauge transducer\nbelt was attached around the chest above the ribcage and be-\nlow the bust. Data was collected using BIOPAC bioamplifiers.\nThe ECG and respiration frequency signals were sampled at a\nrate of 1000 Hz, digitized with a 16-bit analog-to-digital con-\nverter, and processed using AcqKnowledge and MindWare\nsoftware. Following recommendations of the Task Force of\nthe European Society of Cardiology and the North American\nSociety of Pacing and Electrophysiology (1996), we used a\nfrequency domain measure of heart rate variability, namely\nRSA. Thus, vagal activation was indexed by measuring heart\nrate variability in the frequency band between 0.14 and 0.4 Hz\n(high frequency- heart rate variability). R-wave markers in the\nECG signal were evaluated for artifacts by visual inspection\nand the MAD/MED artifact detection algorithm implemented\nin MindWare software (Mindware Heart Rate Variability Ap-\nplication, version 2.51; Mindware Technologies Ltd.). Identi-\nfied artifacts were then manually corrected. Beat-to-beat inter-\nval series were obtained from the ECG and converted into\ntime series of instantaneous beat-to-beat intervals with a res-\nolution of 4 Hz. Spectral analysis using the Welch method\ndetermined the power spectral density in the frequency band\n\n\nJ Psychopathol Behav Assess (2016) 38:20-29\n\n23\n\nbetween 0.14 and 0.4 Hz. This value is then automatically log-\ntransformed to correct for the non-normal distribution, and\n‘minute-by-minute estimates of RSA were determined. This\napproach accords with best-practice guidelines for frequency\ndomain methods to calculate RSA (Berntson et al. 1993; Task\nForce of the European Society of Cardiology and the North\nAmerican Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology 1996).\nData were then analyzed in S-min increments, or as close to\nthis interval as tasks would allow. Specifically, RSA was mea-\nsured during the following four periods: 1. During the S-min\nnature video (baseline), which occurred immediately before\nthe forced-failure stressor; 2. During the first 5 min of the\nforced-failure stressor; 3. During the 5 min immediately be-\nfore the R/D induction, when participants were completing the\nforced-failure stressor (approximately 15-20 min after the\nforced-failure onset); and 4. During the first 6 min of the R/\nD induction (i.c., during the first three R/D prompts).\n\nQuestionnaires Participants completed the Beck Depression\nInventory-II (BDI; Beck et al. 1996), a 21-item measure\nassessing depressive symptom severity (=0.97). Additional-\nly, participants completed the Ruminative Responses Scale of\nthe Response Style Questionnaire (RRS; Nolen-Hoeksema\nand Morrow 1991), a 22-item self-report questionnaire\nassessing individual differences in the tendency to ruminate\nwhen sad (a=0.99).\n\nProcedure\n\nAfter participants provided informed consent, approximately\n5 min were taken to attach psychophysiological equipment\nand ensure the accurate collection of RSA data. Participants\nthen watched a 5-min nature video followed by the forced-\nfailure stressor. Next, participants were randomly assigned to\nthe rumination or cognitive distraction condition of the R/D\ninduction. Before leaving the laboratory, participants watched\na calming nature video in order to provide ample time for\nmood to return to baseline. Participants completed demo-\ngraphic and clinical questionnaires at the end of the\nexperiment.\n\nData Analysis\n\nAnalyses were conducted with SPSS version 20.0. Baseline\nand demographic data were analyzed via one-way analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) and chi square tests. To examine the effect\nof the forced-failure stressor and R/D induction on self-\nreported sadness and RSA, we examined the changes in sad-\nness and RSA as a result of the forced-failure stressor and R/D\ninduction. For example, sadness reactivity to the forced-\nfailure stressor was calculated as sadness rated during the\nforced-failure induction minus sadness at baseline. Sadness\nreactivity to the R/D induction was calculated as sadness rated\n\nafter the R/D induction minus sadness immediately before the\nR/D induction. Positive scores indicate increases in sadness;\nnegative scores indicate decreases in sadness. Similarly, RSA\nreactivity during the forced-failure stressor was calculated as\nRSA measured during the first 5 min of the forced-failure\nstressor minus RSA measured during the § min immediately\nbefore the forced-failure stressor. RSA reactivity during the R/\nD induction was calculated as RSA measured during the first\n6 min of the R/D induction minus RSA measured during the\n5 min immediately before the R/D induction. Positive scores\nindicate RSA activation; negative scores indicate RSA with-\ndrawal. Univariate ANOVAs were used to examine reactivity\nand recovery scores by group (MDD, CTL) and condition\n(rumination, cognitive distraction).\n\nResults\nParticipant and Baseline Characteristics\n\nDemographic and clinical data are presented in Table 1. There\n‘was no significant difference in ethnicity across group or con-\ndition, x’s(1, N=86)<1, and ethnicity did not significantly\ndiffer by group within the rumination, x’s(1, N=43)<1, or\ncognitive distraction conditions, x’s(1, N=43)<1, ps>.05.\nAge also did not significantly differ across groups or condi-\ntions, Fs(1, 83)<1, and age did not significantly differ by\ngroup within the rumination, 42)=1.66, or cognitive distrac-\ntion conditions, #(41)=1.40, ps>.05. Although there was a\nsignificant difference in proportion who were female across\ngroup, x*(1, N=87)=3.86, p=.05, and condition, x*(1, N=\n87)=5.09, p<.05, the proportion female did not differ across\ndiagnostic group within the rumination, x*(1, N=44)=2.93,\nor cognitive distraction condition, x*(1, N=43)=1.28,\nps>.05. As expected, BDI (depressive symptoms), RRS (trait\nrumination), and baseline sadness ratings were significantly\nhigher in the MDD versus CTL group, F(1, 82)>39.19, ps\n<.001. Scores, however, did not differ by R/D condition, and\nthe group by condition interaction was not significant, F5(1,\n82)<1, ps>.05. Baseline RSA did not differ by group or con-\ndition, and the group by condition interaction was not signif-\nicant, Fs(1, 83)<1, ps>.05.\n\nR/D Induction Manipulation Check\n\nParticipants’ written responses during the R/D induction were\ncoded for the extent to which they were ruminating (sce\nRumination Score in Table 1).

To the best of our knowledge, the current\nstudy is the first to examine whether clinically depressed and\nhealthy control participants display different affective and\nparasympathetic responses to a rumination and cognitive dis-\ntraction induction. As expected, rumination increased sadness\nand triggered RSA withdrawal for both MDDs and CTLs.\nInterestingly, although cognitive distraction reduced sadness,\nit also triggered RSA withdrawal. Moreover, cognitive distrac-\ntion was associated with greater RSA withdrawal for MDDs\nthan CTLs. For MDDs, RSA withdrawal was also greater\nduring cognitive distraction than rumination.\n\n!

It also parallels the broader literature, which finds\ncardiovascular activation during perseverative thinking — in-\ncluding worry, rumination, or trauma recall — in analogue sam-\nples (Brosschot et al. 2006; Verkuil et al. 2009). Our data ex-\ntend this literature by comparing clinically depressed and\nhealthy control participants: Results demonstrate that the effect\nof rumination on RSA withdrawal did not significantly differ\nbetween MDDs and CTLs. This finding is relevant to models\nof cardiovascular disease that include rumination as a mecha-\nnism through which MDD heightens risk for cardiovascular\nmorbidity and mortality (Brosschot ct al. 2006; Rozanski\nct al. 1999; Rugulies 2002)\n\n. Given that\nrumination produced similar RSA withdrawal in the MDD and\nCTL groups, models of cardiovascular risk might include not\nonly the cardiovascular effects of rumination but also the fre-\nquency with which individuals ruminate in everyday life.\n\nIn addition, the current study examined the effects of cogni-\ntive distraction on RSA and found RSA withdrawal instead of\nRSA activation. Our results stand in contrast to observations of\ncardiovascular recovery during passive distraction (e.g, Gerin\net al. 2006; Ottaviani et al. 2008, 2009). For example, cardio-\nvascular recovery from stress — indexed via increased parasym-\npathetic activity or decreased sympathetic activity — has been\nobserved when passively viewing neutral pictures and posters\n(Gerin ct al. 2006) or when distracted by overhearing a fabri-\ncated phone conversation (Ottaviani et al. 2008, 2009;\nOttaviani and Shapiro 2011). An important difference between\n\n4) Springer\n\n\n©\n\n6\n\nJ Psychopathol Behav Assess (2016) 38:20-29\n\nour distraction task and passive distraction tasks is that our task\nrequired participants to engage in effortful control over their\nthoughts. In fact, it is this effort that has been posited to drive\nparasympathetic withdrawal during cognitive tasks (Luft ct al.\n2009; Reynard et al. 2011). Interestingly, greater effort has long\nbeen associated with parasympathetic withdrawal (Lundberg and\nFrankenhacuser 1980). Moreover, evidence from other experi-\n‘mental paradigms shows that tasks requiring cognitive effort lead\nto parasympathetic withdrawal (Duschek et al. 2009; Luft ct al.\n2009; Reynard et al. 2011; Verkuil et al. 2009; although see also\nButler etal. 2006, and Segerstrom and Nes 2007, for evidence of\nparasympathetic activation). For example, studies report less\nparasympathetic activity when participants control the content\nof thoughts by thinking and writing about an assigned topic\ncompared to baseline parasympathetic activity (Reynard ct al.\n2011) or when participants think about moral questions (“Is it\nappropriate for your friend to misrepresent his curriculum vitae\nin order to get a job?”; Verkuil et al. 2009). Luft etal. (2009) also\nreported lower parasympathetic activity during tasks requiring\nhigh versus low cognitive effort. More specifically, greater para-\nsympathetic withdrawal was observed during a one-back work-\ning memory task compared to a simple reaction time task.\n\n‘This interpretation is in line with be-\nhavioral data showing that depressed participants are slower to\ndisengage from negative material (see reviews by Gotlib and\nJoormann 2010; Joormann 2010; Koster et al. 2011). It is fur-\nther supported by evidence that depressed individuals show\ngreater activation in brain regions subserving cognitive control\n(dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the insula) when removing\nnegative material from working memory (Foland-Ross ct al.\n2013). Furthermore, during cognitive distraction, individuals\nwith remitted depression exhibited increased neural activity\ncompared to healthy controls in the regulating control-network,\nincluding the anterior cingulate (Kanske et al. 2012). The idea\nof cognitive effort leading to parasympathetic withdrawal is\nalso in line with research showing lower parasympathetic ac-\ntivity in other clinical groups when using adaptive, yet effortful,\nemotion regulation strategies (Aldao and Mennin 2012). Spe-\ncifically, Aldao and Mennin found that individuals with gener-\nalized anxiety disorder exhibited lower parasympathetic activ-\nity when using acceptance or reappraisal to regulate their emo-\ntions compared to when passively viewing a film. Importantly,\nin the current study, despite group differences in parasympa-\nthetic withdrawal during cognitive distraction, both healthy\ncontrols and clinically depressed participants were able to use\ndistraction to repair the sad mood that was induced during the\nforced-failure period. Thus, although cognitive distraction\n\n4) Springer\n\nappears to facilitate emotional recovery from stress, it may be\nassociated with greater cognitive effort for individuals with\nMDD. In fact, for individuals with MDD, RSA withdrawal\nwas even greater during cognitive distraction than rumination,\nfurther emphasizing the effort required for this population to\nengage in cognitive distraction. The fact that we observed a\ndifferent pattern of findings for RSA and self-reported affect\nin the MDD versus CTL group underscores the importance of\nadding physiological measures to clinical assessments.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that, in this study, baseline RSA did\nnot differ between MDD and CTL participants. Interestingly,\nthe literature on baseline RSA in depression is mixed. Where-\nas some studies report lower RSA levels in depressed com-\npared to control participants (Dalack and Roose 1990; Lehofer\nct al. 1999; Rottenberg ct al. 2007), others report no differ-\nences in RSA levels (c.g, Lehofer et al. 1997; Moser et al.\n1998). Although a meta-analysis conducted by Rottenberg\n(2007) found that depression was associated with lower levels\nof resting RSA (4=0.33), only 6 of the 39 comparisons indi-\ncated a significant difference between depressed and control\nparticipants, and depression accounted for only about 2 % of\nthe variance in RSA. Moreover, Rottenberg (2007) concludes\nthat the overall effect of depression on RSA likely reflects an\nupper-bound estimate that may be very modest after account-\ning for confounds and unpublished studies, thereby casting\ndoubt on the effects of depression on baseline RSA. When\nincorporating our findings on baseline RSA into the broader\nliterature, it is important to consider the fact that we measured\nbaseline RSA while participants were watching a calming nature\nvideo, which may have served as a passive distraction task,\nwhich has been shown to increase parasympathetic activity\n(Gerin et al. 2006; Ottaviani et al. 2009; Ottaviani and Shapiro\n2011). We, therefore, caution against direct comparison between\nbaseline RSA measured in the current study with that measured\nin studies where participants are not engaging in any activity.\n\n‘The current study has several limitations. For one, comorbid\nhealth conditions were determined based on participants’ self\nreport, and it is possible that participants may have been un-\naware of prior cardiovascular conditions that would have affect-\ned RSA. However, using reactivity and recovery, as opposed to\nraw scores, minimized external sources of variability. Nonethe-\nless, future work might consider including a physical checkup.\nFuture studies might also include additional measures of cardio-\nvascular health, including blood pressure or pre-cjection period\n(PEP). A second limitation is that the current study did not\ndirectly assess self-reported effort, which prevents us from\ndrawing a direct connection between effort and parasympathetic\nwithdrawal during the cognitive distraction induction. Lastly,\ndespite random assignment to the cognitive distraction and ru-\nmination conditions, there was an unequal proportion of female\nparticipants across cells. Importantly, however, the group by\ncondition interaction on RSA recovery remained significant\nwhen sex was included in the model.\n\n\nJ Psychopathol Behav Assess (2016) 38:20-29\n\n27\n\nDespite these limitations, the current study offers a unique\nexamination of parasympathetic activity during a rumination\nand cognitive distraction induction in clinically depressed\nversus healthy control participants. Findings demonstrate that\nthe effect of rumination on RSA did not significantly differ\nbetween the MDD and CTL groups. In addition, the current\nstudy provides the first evidence of the effects of cognitive\ndistraction on RSA. in MDD. Our results demonstrate that\ndistraction leads to greater parasympathetic withdrawal,\nindexed via RSA withdrawal, for MDDs than CTLs, which\nmay reflect that depressed individuals require additional ef-\nfort to disengage from negative material. We hope that this\nstudy also demonstrates the importance and feasibility of in-\ncorporating physiological measures into assessments of emo-\ntion regulation. Assessing RSA activity can provide informa-\ntion about parasympathetic activation that cannot be obtained\nfrom self-report measures. Thus, information on RSA could\nhelp understand the effects of different emotion regulation\nstrategies on patients’ physical health, which is especially\nrelevant for patients with comorbid health conditions. In ad-\ndition, to the extent that RSA withdrawal indexes cognitive\neffort, examining changes in RSA during cognitive distrac-\ntion may prove a useful tool to assess skill integration as\ntreatment progresses. With practice, cognitive distraction\nshould become less effortful for depressed individuals, lead-\ning to less RSA withdrawal. These assessment options are\npossible given that RSA provides a low-cost physiological\nmeasure that can be assessed with minimal disruption in ap-\nplied research and clinical settings. With the development of\ndevices to collect ambulatory RSA, barriers to data collection\nhave decreased even further. Future work might examine\nparasympathetic activation during other emotion regulation\nstrategies, including the use of emotion regulation strategies\nin naturalistic settings. Additionally, investigators conducting\nresearch in applied or clinical settings might test whether\nparasympathetic withdrawal during cognitive distraction de-\ncreases with treatment or practice.\n\nAcknowledgments This work was supported by grant F31-MH086246.\n\nConflicts of Interest Joelle LeMoult, K.
