This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate\npotential differences in brain activation patterns in these conditions. In addition, the function of the hypothalamic —pituitary—\nadrenal (HPA) axis was examined and compared between groups. Since there is a clear overrepresentation of women in these\ndiagnostic groups, and to ensure a more homogenous sample population, only women were included. To examine the neural\ncorrelates of relevant cognitive processes in patients on sick leave >90 days due to work-related LTSL, recently diagnosed\npatients with major depression Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV criteria,\nuntreated), and healthy controls (2 = 10, each group), a 2-back working memory task and a visual long-term memory task\nwere administered during fMRI scanning. HPA axis functioning was investigated using a diurnal curve of saliva cortisol and a\ndexamethasone suppression test. Task performance was comparable among the three groups. Multivariate image analysis\nrevealed that both memory tasks engaged a similar brain network in all three groups, including the prefrontal and parietal\ncortex. During the 2-back task, LTSL patients had significant frontal hypoactivation compared to controls and patients with\ndepression. Saliva cortisol measurements showed a flattening of the diurnal rythmicity in LTSL patients compared to patients\nwith depression and healthy contols. Taken together, these findings indicate that work stress-related LTSL and major\ndepression are dissociable in terms of frontal activation and diurnal cortisol rhythmicity.\n\nKeywords: Cognition, fMRI, HPA axis, multivariate, prefrontal, stress\n\nIntroduction notably the hypothalamic pituitaryadrenal (HPA)\naxis as well as immune and metabolic systems are\ninvolved in the process of protecting the organism\nfrom and adapting to challenges. This process,\nreferred to as allostasis, is an essential component\nof maintaining homeostasis (McEwen 2003). One\nexample of allostasis is improved memory and\nimmune function with moderate increases in cortisol,\n\nStress has emerged as an important factor in\npsychiatric diagnoses. A dysregulation of stress\nsystems is implicated in major diagnostic categories,\nincluding mood and anxiety disorders, potentially\nreflecting psychological responses to work-related\nand personal stressors (McEwen 2003; Wahlberg\net al. 2009). Psychosocial factors and individual\n\ndifferences in coping style, emotional state, cognition,\nand appraisal have major impact on stress regulation\n(Berntson and Cacioppo 2000; Cacioppo 2002).\nThe brain is the central mediator of physiological\nadjustments and behavioral responses to behavioral\nchallenges (McEwen 2006). Hormonal systems,\n\nwhich helps overcome challenging situations. Per-\nsistently high concentrations of cortisol may in\ncontrast have adverse effects, including inhibiting\nthe formation of new neurons (neurogenesis) in the\nhippocampal region of the brain, possibly leading to\ncognitive deficits and dysregulation of the HPA axis\n\nCorrespondence: A.

Sandstrom et al.\n\n(Alderson and Novack 2002; Lupien et al. 2005). The\nclose relationship between stress, allostatic load, and\nits impact on cognitive and endocrine function is well\nestablished in psychiatric research today (Lupien et al.\n2007). Notably, specific alterations of HPA axis and\ncognitive function in different diagnostic categories of\npsychiatric diseases, such as major depression and\npost traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are well\ndocumented (Lupien et al. 2009). In Sweden, more\nthan 50% of patients who were on long-term sick leave\n(LTSL) reported work-related stress as the main cause\nof disease (The Swedish National Social Insurance\nBoard 2003).\n\nResearch efforts in the field of work-related stress are\ncomplicated by the lack of consensus about diagnostic\ncriteria. Depression is the category of use in the field of\nstress-related disorders, despite the fact that several\nscientific papers indicate that depression and work-\nrelated stress do not share patterns of physiological and\npsychological changes (Rydmark et al. 2006; Wahlberg\net al. 2009). The concept of burnout is initially a\ndescription of the frustration and emotional detach-\nment seen in social and health workers (Mason 1975;\nMaslach et al. 2001). Originally, the term was not\nmeant as a classification of disease, but rather a\ndescription of the process of exhaustion or adaptation\nto an overwhelming work situation. The Swedish\nNational Board of Health and Welfare recently\nrecommended a specific International statistical\nclassification of diseases and related health problems\n(ICD)-10 code (i.e. exhaustion syndrome F43.8) to\nclassify the closely related terms: clinical burnout, vital\nexhaustion, and mental fatigue. As proposed byAsberg\nand co-workers, burnout should not be considered a\nnecessary or sufficient condition for developing stress-\nrelated disease. Rather, itis a process or coping strategy\nto endure challenging situations at work that may lead\nto disease or exhaustion syndrome (Asberg etal. 2010).\nSince there is no international consensus on this issue,\nwe have used the term work-related LTSL in this study.\n\n‘The symptoms of individuals on work-related LTSL.\noverlap with core symptoms of major depression\n(Wahlberg et al. 2009), which has prompted examin-\nations of whether individuals on LTSL due to work\nstress and patients with major depression share HPA\naxis pathophysiology (Rydmark et al. 2006). Though\nmajor depression has been associated with up-\nregulated reactivity of the HPA axis, patients with\nstress were found to exhibit a marked decrease in the\nreactivity of the HPA axis (Wahlberg etal. 2009). In the\nsame study, no support was obtained for a reduction in\nhippocampal volume, and cognitive impairment was\nmore indicative of a disruption of the frontocortical\nsystem rather than hippocampus dysfunction. We and\nothers have reported a similar pattern of neurocogni-\ntive alterations in stressed patients, with evidence of\nfrontal cognitive deficits (Sandstrom et al. 2005) and\nintact hippocampal volume (Sandstrom et al. 2011).\n\nIn contrast, major depression has repeatedly been\nassociated with lowered performance on hippocampal-\ndependent explicit/episodic memory tasks (Airaksinen\net al. 2004) and reduced hippocampal volume\n(Videbech and Ravnkilde 2004).\n\nCollectively, these findings suggest differences\nbetween major depression and chronic stress. In\nparticular, individuals on LTSL due to work stress\ntend to exhibit frontal, rather than hippocampal,\ndysfunction. This view is in line with a notion of the\nstress—brain link that implicates many cortical and\nsubcortical regions other than the hippocampus,\nincluding the frontal cortex (Lupien and Lepage\n2001). Converging evidence indicates that not only\naffective but also cognitive regions in the frontal lobes\nare dysfunctional in major depression (Steele et al.\n2007), and patients suffering from major depression\nexhibit a pattern of cognitive dysfunction that extends\nbeyond the domain of explicit/episodic memory to\nexecutive, frontal lobe-sensitive tasks (Stordal et al.\n2004; Dahlin et al. 2008). Furthermore, imaging\nstudies have suggested an increased activity in the\nsubgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in\npatients with depression, which is decreased by\nsuccessful treatment (Mayberg et al. 2003, 2005).\n\nDirect, within-study, comparisons of patients on\nLTSL due to work stress and patients with major\ndepression are critical for addressing the questions of\nwhether these two categories reflect a shared or distinct\npathophysiology. To date, such studies are rare and, to\nthe best of our knowledge, no prior study has\ncompared the functional brain responses of patients\nfrom each category while engaged in memory tasks.\n\nThe main objective of this study was to compare\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI)\npatterns and diurnal cortisol across three groups:\n(i) controls, (ii) acute unmedicated patients with\nunipolar major depression, and (iii) patients on\nLTSL due to work stress. During fMRI scanning,\nthe participants alternated between a baseline task, an\nn-back working memory protocol known to reliably\nelicit frontal activity (Dahlin et al. 2008), and the\ncontinuous visual memory task (CVMT) that has\nbeen related to hippocampal activity (Yassa and\nStark 2008). First, we assessed similarities and\ndifferences in task-related fMRI activity among groups\nusing a multivariate partial least squares (PLS)\nanalysis (McIntosh and Lobaugh 2004; Salami et al.\n2010), and then conducted univariate contrasts\nguided by the multivariate findings. We predicted\ngroup differences in engagement of prefrontal cortex,\nsuch that the stress group would under-recruit some\nfrontal regions. In addition, the diurnal rhythm of\nsaliva cortisol and the cortisol response to the\ndexamethasone suppression test (DST) was investi-\ngated using saliva samples. We predicted that\ndepressed patients would have higher cortisol levels,\nespecially after dexamethasone (DEX).\n\n\nMethods and materials\nSubjects\n\nA total of 30 females participated in the study, 10 in\neach group: work stress-related LTSL, unipolar major\ndepression, and healthy controls (Table I). The\ndepressed patients were recruited from the psychiatric\nclinic at Norrland’s University Hospital. The stress\npatients were recruited from the stress clinic at the\nsame hospital and were part of a larger study\n(Stenlund et al. 2009), which aimed at exploring\nwork-related long-term stress.\n\nExclusion criteria were left-handedness or ambi-\ndextrousness, co-morbid psychiatric disorders, known\nabuse of alcohol or drugs, endocrinological diseases,\nand neurological disorders. Subjects who were not\nmenstruating were also excluded. All participants\nwere native Swedish speakers. For the stress group,\nadditional exclusion criteria were other diseases that\ncould result in fatigue and/or stress-related symptoms,\nother diseases that cause future sick leave, other\ndiseases or treatments that can interfere with active\nparticipation, post-traumatic stress disorder, unem-\nployment for more than 2 years prior to participation,\nspeech and language difficulties, and a need for\nindividual therapy.\n\nThe patients with depression and the controls were\nall medication-naive. In the work stress-related LTSL\ngroup, four patients were taking selective serotonin\n\nBrain activity in depression and stress 505\nreuptake inhibitors. None of the stress patients were\ntaking tricyclic anti-depressants.\n\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee\nfor Medical Research at Norrland’s University\nHospital. All patients provided informed written\nconsent after having the procedure and objective of\nthe study carefully explained to them and after the\nopportunity to ask questions. Subjects were not paid\nfor their participation.\n\nClinical assessments\n\nThe depressed patients were assessed by a clinically\nexperienced psychologist (RS). The interviews\nreviewed clinical and demographic information, and\nthe obtained data were used to confirm or reject a\ndiagnosis of unipolar major depressive disorder\naccording to DSM-IV. Depression severity was\nmeasured with the Montgomery Asberg depression\nrating scale (MADRS) (Montgomery and Asberg\n1979; Svanborg and Asberg 1994). To be included\nin the depression group, participants had to have\na minimum score of 20, which reflects moderate to\nsevere depression. All of the depressed patients were\neither on sick leave or otherwise incapable to work due\nto the severity of their symptoms.\n\nThe stress patients were subjected to medical\nand psychological examinations to confirm the\ndiagnosis of burnout (Schaufeli and Enzmann\n\nTable I.

The patients were required to have been on\ncontinuous sick leave for burnout and stress-related\ndisorder =25% of their working hours for at least 3\nmonths and to have an average score of =4.6 on the\nShirom Melamed burnout questionnaire (Kushnir\nand Melamed 1992; Melamed et al. 1992, 1999).\n\nAll subjects were assessed with the MADRS,\nthe Hamilton anxiety scale (HAS), the perceived\nstress questionnaire (PSQ), and the burnout inventory\n(BI) on the day of the fMRI examination. Group\ncharacteristics are presented in Table I.\n\nAll self-rating scales and measurements of psychia-\ntric health used in this work are well known, validated,\nand reliable with excellent Cronbach’s a. MADRS is a\nwidely used questionnaire to measure severity of\ndepression. It is sensitive to change and therefore\ncommon in treatment studies. MADRS Cronbach’s a\nvaries between 0.80 and 0.90 (Montgomery and\nAsberg 1979). The HAS is considered a gold standard\nquestionnaire designed to assess anxiety symptoms\nregardless of diagnosis. It is sensitive to change and is\nfrequently used in clinical trials. Cronbach’s a ranging\nbetween 0.77 and 0.99 has been reported in different\nstudies (Hamilton 1959). PSQ is a self-assessment-\nbased instrument for recording subjective perceived\nstress (Cronbach’s a > 0.90) (Levenstein etal. 1993).\nThe BI is designed to assess components of the\nburnout syndrome: emotional exhaustion, deperso-\nnalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Its\nreported internal consistency/Cronbach’s a ranges\nbetween 0.71 and 0.90.\n\nFMRI procedure. fMRI was used to assess brain\nresponses while the subjects performed two cognitive\ntasks: the n-back task and a visual long-term memory\ntask. Additionally, during the fMRI session, a low-\ndemand baseline condition was modeled as a block\ndesign to achieve similar sensorimotor activation as\nthe experimental tasks.\n\nThe n-back task is a commonly used working\nmemory task in fMRI studies. Subjects are presented\na series of stimuli and required to respond if the\ncurrent stimulus matches the stimulus displayed\nn steps earlier in the sequence. In our version, single\nwords were displayed and the subjects were asked\nto indicate whether the displayed word was the same\nas or different from the one displayed two words\nearlier (2-back).\n\n‘The visual long-term memory task consisted of a set\nof black and white abstract and non-verbal pictures\ndrawn from the CVMT (Larrabee et al. 1992). The\npictures were displayed one at a time and the subjects\nwere told to respond “yes” or “no” as to whether they\nrecognized the picture from earlier presentations (i.e.\na continuous recognition test).\n\nFor both tasks, responses were given by pressing\none of two buttons using the right or left index finger.\n\nIn the baseline condition, the letters “xxxxx” were\ndisplayed on the computer screen either to the left or\nto the right side, and the subjects were told to press the\nbutton on the corresponding side. All stimuli (2-back\nwords, pictures, or letters) were displayed for 2.55,\nfollowed by a 0.5s fixation cross, and all blocks\nconsisted of 16 stimuli. The blocked task paradigm\nalternated between the baseline condition, the 2-back\ncondition, and the visual memory condition, and this\nwas repeated in five sessions in a sequential order.\nStimuli were presented in the same order to all\nsubjects during all sessions. Behavioral performance\nwas recorded for reaction times and response\naccuracy. Prior to fMRI scanning, subjects were\ninstructed and underwent a trial version of the task\nto ensure that they had understood the instructions.\nData collection was performed using a 1.5 T Philips\nIntera scanner (Philips Medical Systems, the\nNetherlands). Functional T2*-weighted images were\ncollected with a single-shot, gradient echo EPI\nsequence used for blood oxygen level-dependent\nimaging. The sequence had the following parameters:\necho time 50 ms, repetition time 3000 ms, flip angle\n90°, field of view 22 X 22 cm, 64 X 64 matrix, and slice\nthickness 3.9 mm. Thirty-three slices were acquired\nevery 3.0s. To eliminate signals arising from\nprogressive saturation, five dummy scans were\nperformed prior to image acquisition. Cushions and\nheadphones in the scanner were used to reduce head\nmovement, dampen scanner noise, and communicate\nwith the subjects. The stimuli were presented on a\nsemi-transparent screen, which the subjects viewed\nthrough a tilted mirror attached to the head coil.\nPresentation and reaction times were handled by a\nPC running E-Prime 1.0 (Psychology Software Tools,\nPA, USA). Responses were collected with fiber optic\nresponse boxes, one in each hand (Lumitouch reply\nsystem, Lightwave Medical Industries, Canada). After\nthe functional imaging, high-resolution T1- and\nT2-weighted structural images were acquired.\n\nRoutine analyses. Subjects and controls were screened\nin a fasting state at 08:00h with routine venous\nblood sampling (5ml) for each individual for later\nanalyses of full blood count, liver and kidney function\ntests, and thyroid hormones at the clinical chemistry\nlaboratory (University Hospital of Umea, Sweden).\n\nCortisol analyses. HPA axis tests were performed within\n10 days after cessation of a menstrual bleeding (i.e.\nduring the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle).\nStudy subjects were supplied with marked test tube\nand instructed to spit in the tubes at 07:00, 11:00,\n16:00, 19:00, and 23:00 h. This was followed by a low-\ndose DST in which subjects ingested 0.25 mg DEX\n(Decadron® MSD) after the 23:00h saliva sample.\n\n\nOn the following morning, a saliva sample was\ncollected at 07:00h for estimations of cortisol. No\nfood, tobacco, or tooth brushing was allowed during\nthe hour preceding sampling. Saliva cortisol was\nanalyzed at the clinical chemistry laboratory,\nUniversity Hospital of Umes, by radioimmunoassay\nfrom Spectra, Orion Diagnostica, Finland, according\nto the manufacturer's procedure for salivary cortisol.\nThe coefficient of variances (CVs) were <12% for\nsaliva cortisol with an analytical detection limit of\n0.8 nmol/l, according to the manufacturer.\n\nData and statistical analyses\n\nPre-processing of fMRI data. The fMRI images\nwere sent to a PC and converted to Analyze format.\nThe images were then pre-processed and analyzed\nusing SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive\nNeurology, UK) implemented in Matlab 7.1\n(Mathworks, Inc., MA, USA). During the pre-\nprocessing steps, the images were corrected for slice\ntiming to adjust for acquisition time differences\nbetween slices and subsequently realigned to the first\nvolume to account for subjects movement. The images\nwere then normalized to a standard anatomic space\ndefined by the MNI Atlas (SPM2) and finally spatially\nsmoothed using an 8.0-mm full-width at half-\nmaximum isotropic Gaussian filter kernel.\n\nMultivariate analysis of fMRI data. PLS reflects time-\nvarying distributed patterns in the brain (as a function\nof a task) without any assumption about how\nconditions collate to form a pattern and shape of the\nhemodynamic response function (HRF). A detailed\ndescription of how task PLS can be applied to fMRI\ndata can be found in earlier studies (Salami et al.\n2010). In short, a data matrix is constructed to\nfacilitate the operation of PLS on the entire data. This\nmatrix is subjected to mean centering, followed by\nsingular value decomposition (SVD), to produce\northogonal latent variables (LVs). Each LV contains\nvoxel/design saliencies and brain scores. The latter\nreflects the strength of the contribution of each subject\nto the LV, whereas the former reflects brain activation\nrelated to the experimental design. The significance of\neach LV, indicating whether the overall pattern is\ndifferent from randomness, was assessed by a\npermutation test (McIntosh and Lobaugh 2004).\nUsing PLS, it is feasible to extract the commonality as\nwell as the differences of brain activations across\ndifferent groups. Here, the critical interest was to\ninvestigate whether there were any group differences\nin brain activity in relation to the three tasks.\nBehavioral PLS analyzes the relationship between\nthe behavioral measures (e.g. reaction times) and the\nfunctional brain activity of groups. The procedure is\nroughly the same as the one described above for task\n\nBrain activity in depression and stress 507\n\nPLS, but instead of mean centering, a correlation\nanalysis is conducted between the data and behavioral\nmeasures. As such behavioral saliencies were obtained\nfrom SVD indicating task-dependent differences in\nthe brain-behavior correlation. A similar pattern of\nscores depicting experimental differences in behavior\ncan be obtained by conducting a correlation between\nthe brain scores and each behavioral measure. The\nconfidence interval (CI) around a brain-behavior\ncorrelation reveals its reliability.\n\nUnivariate analysis of fMRI data. Each condition (2-\nback, visual long-term memory task, and baseline) was\nmodeled as a fixed response (boxcar) waveform\nconvolved with the HRF. Single-subject statistical\ncontrasts (the 2-back task vs. baseline and the visual\nrecognition task vs. baseline) were generated (in\nSPM5) using a voxel-wise general linear model.\nContrast images for each subject at each session\nwere taken into the second-level random effect\nanalysis (one-sample t-test) to identify regions\nactivated across the groups for each model. The\nreported activations were significant at a voxel level of\np< 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons,\nwith an extent of >5 contiguous voxels.\n\nOther data. Data are shown as mean * 1 standard\ndeviation or means = SEM (standard error of mean),\nas indicated in the text. Non-parametric statistics\n(Kruskal-Wallis) with Bonferroni corrections was\nused to test for group differences. Repeated measures\nanalysis (ANOVA) for the 07:00 and 11:00h\nassessments of saliva cortisol was used to assess\nputative group by time interactions. A p value <0.05\nwas considered statistically significant. SPSS v14.0\nwas used for the univariate statistical analyses.\n\nResults\nBehavioral variables\n\nThe average MADRS, PSQ, and burnout scores\nwere highest in the depression group (Table I). All\nmeasurements of psychological health in the\ndepression group were significantly different from\nthe control group as well as the work-related LTSL\ngroup. All depressed subjects and five LTSL subjects\nhad MADRS scores above the depression limit of\n20, whereas none of the controls had MADRS\nscores over 20. A significant difference in the HAS\nwas found between controls and the patient groups,\nbut no significant difference was found between the\ndepressed patients and individuals on LTSL.\nPatients with depression were significantly younger\nthan controls and individuals on LTSL. The PSQ\nand MADRS scores also significantly differed among\n\n\n508 A. Sandstrom et al.\n\ngroups (Table I). Burnout scores and HAS did not\ndiffer between patient groups but separated controls\nfrom the two patient groups.\n\nBrain imaging\n\nThe multivariate PLS analysis revealed two signi-\nficant patterns (p < 0.0001, Figure 1) that were\nhighly similar across the three groups, suggesting\na high degree of similarity in the functional brain\npatterns of patients and controls. However, some\ngroup differences were also observed.\n\nThe first LV accounted for 46% of the cross-block\ncovariance and delineated a main effect of memory\ntask (i.e. n-back/CVMT vs. baseline; Figure 1). The\neffect was most pronounced for the visual CVMT,\nand occipital regions were found to contribute to the\neffect, reflecting a stronger engagement of visual areas\nduring the processing of complex pictures compared\nto strings of Xs. For controls and depressed patients,\nthe n-back task also significantly contributed to the\neffect, but this was not the case for the stress patients\n(the CI for the n-back task in the LTSL group crossed\nzero; Figure 1). Prefrontal regions, mainly in the right\nhemisphere, contributed to the effect expressed by\nLV1 (Figure 1, top row), thus indicating lesser\ninvolvement of prefrontal regions in the n-back for\nstress patients. This interpretation was examined in\nmore detail in the univariate analyses reported below.\n\nThe second pattern (Figure 1, bottom row), which\naccounted for 29.5% of the cross-block covariance,\nmainly reflected a difference between the two\ncognitive tasks (n-back vs. CVMT). During the\nn-back task, a well-characterized frontoparietal net-\nwork was activated (Figure 1, bottom row; red),\nwhereas dorsal occipital and temporal polar regions\nwere differentially more engaged during CVMT, and\n\nTable IL\n\nto some degree during the baseline task (Figure 1,\nbottom row; blue). This effect was similarly expressed\nacross all three groups.\n\nThe univariate SPM analyses involved group\ncomparisons of n-back vs. baseline and CVMT\nvs. baseline. On the basis of the multivariate analysis,\nwe expected weak or no group differences for CVMT,\nbut some differences for n-back. This prediction\nwas confirmed by lack of significant group differences\nfor CVMT along with a significant group difference\nfor n-bac]\n\nnetworks in the patients, However, during the n-back\n\ntask, the LTSL subjects tended to under-recruit\nregions in the prefrontal cortex.\n\nDiurnal cortisol rhythm\n\ngroup had a tendency toward fattening. This cffect\n\nwas pronounced between the 07:00 am and 11:00 am\nrecordings, as reflected by a significant group (controls\nvs. stress patients) by time (07:00 vs. 11:00h)\ninteraction in an ANOVA [F (15) = 4.65; p = 0.03].\n\nBrain— cognition correlations\n\nDue to the observation of altered brain activity in\nLTSL patients during n-back (Figure 1), we analyzed\nindividual differences in response times during n-back\nin relation to brain activity (behavioral PLS).

The singular images are overlaid on a standard MRI\ntemplate.\n\n(A) Brain regions with significant activation differences\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe main objective of this study was to compare\nmemory-related brain activity patterns and diurnal\ncortisol between acute unmedicated patients with\nunipolar major depression and patients on LTSL due\nto work stress. Of main interest was to examine\nwhether LTSL patients under-recruited parts of\nfrontal cortex during cognitive processing.\n\n‘The fMRI results showed pronounced similarities in\nactivation patterns across the groups, suggesting\nlargely intact functional networks. This was further\nsubstantiated by intact cognitive performance.\nHowever, during the more demanding cognitive task\n(n-back), the LTSL subjects showed a reduction\nin prefrontal cortex activation. Specifically, a group\ndifference was observed in the right dorsolateral\nand left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. In addition,\n\nresponse times during n-back correlated with brain\nactivity for controls and depressed patients but not for\nthe LTSL subjects, who tended to have a slower\nresponse. This pattern of slowed response and\nreduced frontal activity in patients with stress disorder\nis consistent with previous findings that patients with\nstress exhibit reduced performance on cognitively\ndemanding tasks that are assumed to reflect the\nintegrity of frontal lobe functioning (Rydmark et al.\n2006; Ohman et al. 2007; Sandstrom et al. 2011).\nIn particular, the findings from the brain- cognition\ncorrelation analysis are indicative of alterations of\nfunctional working memory networks in LTSL\npatients. Still, as this observation was found in a\nmore exploratory analysis and was based on a\nrelatively small group of patients, further generali-\nzations must await future replication.\n\nMore generally, the present findings are in line with\nthe view that the frontal cortex may be as critical as the\nhippocampus when it comes to the regulation of\nstress (Lupien et al. 2009). Notably, this is a dual\nrelationship, as the medial prefrontal cortex as well as\nthe hippocampus may be an important target for\nglucocorticoid actions (Herman et al. 2005). Indeed,\na recent study has shown that chronic stress or chronic\nadministration of glucocorticoids produces dendritic\nremodeling in prefrontal pyramidal neurons (Martin\nand Wellman 2011).\n\nThe diurnal saliva cortisol curve for the LTSL\npatients showed a trend toward flattening with higher\ncortisol levels at 11:00h, whereas controls and\ndepressed patients had similar diurnal patterns. It\nremains to be determined if a blunted diurnal cortisol\nrhythm relates to changes in frontal cortex function.\nPrevious work on the effect of glucocorticoids on\n\n20\n~~ Major depression n=7\n= Work stress related LTSL n=8\n\n= 4 Controls n=8\n\n°\n\ng\n\n£\n\n2 10\n\n5\n\n8\n\ng\n\n©\n\n[2]\n\n0\n\n7 1 16 19 23\nSampling times hours\n\nPost Dex\n\nFigure 3.

Behavioral pattern, singular image, and correlation overview for the only significant behavioral PLS LV1 (p < 0.005). The top row\ndemonstrates the behavioral LV that expressed a contrast, indicating task-dependent group differences in the brain behavior correlation. The\nsecond row shows the brain regions (overlaid on a standard MRI template) that negatively correlated with behavioral measures. The most\nreliable regions in the positive and negative directions were right middle frontal (x, y, z: 46, — 2, 56; BSR = 9.59; 1531 voxels) and left fusiform\n(x, 3» 2: —36, —56, —8; BSR = —4.38; 11 voxels) cortex, respectively. The bottom row shows the correlation overview in scatter plots,\nreflecting the correlation between brain scores and reaction times for the 2-back task within LV1. The correlation was significant (r= — 0.73;\nr= —0.80) for the first two columns (control and depression groups), but was roughly zero for the third column (stress group).\n\n\n\n512 A. Sandstrom et al.\n\nmemory function showed that they lead to deficits in\ncognitive tasks sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction\n(working memory), but do not impact cognitive\nfunctions sensitive to hippocampal damage. Notably,\nrepeated cortisol measurements across several days,\nincluding different weekdays, might provide\nadditional insight. Also, estimation of the cortisol\nawakening response be of interest, since several\nstudies have suggested an altered awakening response\nin different neuropsychiatric conditions (Kudielka and\n\nWast 2010). We did not find any difference in DEX\nsuppression between depressed subjects and controls.\n\nThis is of interest and suggests that short-term\nexposure to a depressive state may be less related to\nfailure of “shut-off” of the HPA axis. Indeed, the total\nlength of depression periods may be an important\npredictor of hippocampal dysfunction/volume which\nmay relate to dysfunctional feedback function in the\nHPA axis. The number of participants in this study\nwas also insufficient to reveal subgroups of depressed\npatients with different HPA axis activity. It has also\nbeen suggested that age of onset for depression may\ninfluence hippocampal function/volume, but this is a\nmatter of controversy (MacQueen and Frodl 2011).\n\nThe healthy subjects and depressed patients showed\nmarked similarities in brain activation patterns,\ndespite the fact that depressed subjects indicated\npoorer health in all measures of subjective well-being.\nNotably, the depressed group did not show the\nincreased sACC activity that has been reported earlier\nby Mayberg et al. (1999) and Mayberg (2003). These\ndiscrepancies may be related to the fact that the\ndepressed patients in this study were recently\ndiagnosed. Repeated episodes of major depression,\nas well as the severity of episodes, are known to\ncorrelate with structural and functional changes in the\nbrain, possibly reflecting hypersecretion of glucocor-\nticoids (Sapolsky 2000). Taken together, the amount\nof time a person is sick might be a crucial factor for\ndeveloping changes in frontal lobe functioning.\nImportantly, we wanted to avoid treatment with\nanxiolytics and other substances known to influence\ncognitive function, thereby creating another possible\nconfounder. An additional possible confounder is the\nyounger age of the depressed group vs. the LTSL\ngroup in our study. Finally, it is possible that the high\nscores in experienced stress and burnout in our\ndepressed group raise the possibility that some of them\nare suffering from work-related stress.\n\nIn summary, the present findings suggest a\ndifference between patient categories, such that\nlong-term stress relative to acute depression induces\nchanges in functional brain activity, notably in areas\nwithin the frontal cortex, as well as a flattening of the\ndiurnal cortisol curve. These findings need to be\nvalidated in future studies with larger samples, also\nincluding men. Future studies should also explore\nwhether functional and cognitive dysfunction, as\n\nshown in this study, is reversible by various\ninterventions.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAS and RS contributed equally to this article.
