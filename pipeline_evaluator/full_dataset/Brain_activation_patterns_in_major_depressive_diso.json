This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigatepotential differences in brain activation patterns in these conditions. In addition, the function of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis was examined and compared between groups. Since there is a clear overrepresentation of women in thesediagnostic groups, and to ensure a more homogenous sample population, only women were included. To examine the neuralcorrelates of relevant cognitive processes in patients on sick leave .90 days due to work-related LTSL, recently diagnosedpatients with major depression Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV criteria,untreated), and healthy controls ( n\u00bc10, each group), a 2-back working memory task and a visual long-term memory taskwere administered during fMRI scanning. HPA axis functioning was investigated using a diurnal curve of saliva cortisol and adexamethasone suppression test. Task performance was comparable among the three groups. Multivariate image analysisrevealed that both memory tasks engaged a similar brain network in all three groups, including the prefrontal and parietalcortex. During the 2-back task, LTSL patients had signi\ufb01cant frontal hypoactivation compared to controls and patients withdepression. Saliva cortisol measurements showed a \ufb02attening of the diurnal rythmicity in LTSL patients compared to patientswith depression and healthy contols. Taken together, these \ufb01ndings indicate that work stress-related LTSL and majordepression are dissociable in terms of frontal activation and diurnal cortisol rhythmicity.Keywords: Cognition, fMRI, HPA axis, multivariate, prefrontal, stressIntroductionStress has emerged as an important factor inpsychiatric diagnoses. A dysregulation of stresssystems is implicated in major diagnostic categories,including mood and anxiety disorders, potentiallyre\ufb02ecting psychological responses to work-relatedand personal stressors (McEwen 2003; Wahlberget al. 2009). Psychosocial factors and individualdifferences in coping style, emotional state, cognition,and appraisal have major impact on stress regulation(Berntson and Cacioppo 2000; Cacioppo 2002).The brain is the central mediator of physiologicaladjustments and behavioral responses to behavioralchallenges (McEwen 2006). Hormonal systems,notably the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA)axis as well as immune and metabolic systems areinvolved in the process of protecting the organismfrom and adapting to challenges. This process,referred to as allostasis, is an essential componentof maintaining homeostasis (McEwen 2003). Oneexample of allostasis is improved memory andimmune function with moderate increases in cortisol,which helps overcome challenging situations. Per-sistently high concentrations of cortisol may incontrast have adverse effects, including inhibitingthe formation of new neurons (neurogenesis) in thehippocampal region of the brain, possibly leading tocognitive de\ufb01cits and dysregulation of the HPA axisCorrespondence: A.

E-mail: agneta.sandstrom@jll.seStress , September 2012; 15(5): 503\u2013513qInforma Healthcare USA, Inc.ISSN 1025-3890 print/ISSN 1607-8888 onlineDOI: 10.3109/10253890.2011.646347(Alderson and Novack 2002; Lupien et al. 2005). Theclose relationship between stress, allostatic load, andits impact on cognitive and endocrine function is wellestablished in psychiatric research today (Lupien et al.2007). Notably, speci\ufb01c alterations of HPA axis andcognitive function in different diagnostic categories ofpsychiatric diseases, such as major depression andpost traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are welldocumented (Lupien et al. 2009). In Sweden, morethan 50% of patients who were on long-term sick leave(LTSL) reported work-related stress as the main causeof disease (The Swedish National Social InsuranceBoard 2003).Research efforts in the \ufb01eld of work-related stress arecomplicated by the lack of consensus about diagnosticcriteria. Depression is the category of use in the \ufb01eld ofstress-related disorders, despite the fact that severalscienti\ufb01c papers indicate that depression and work-related stress do not share patterns of physiological andpsychological changes (Rydmark et al. 2006; Wahlberget al. 2009). The concept of burnout is initially adescription of the frustration and emotional detach-ment seen in social and health workers (Mason 1975;Maslach et al. 2001). Originally, the term was notmeant as a classi\ufb01cation of disease, but rather adescription of the process of exhaustion or adaptationto an overwhelming work situation. The SwedishNational Board of Health and Welfare recentlyrecommended a speci\ufb01c International statisticalclassi\ufb01cation of diseases and related health problems(ICD)-10 code (i.e. exhaustion syndrome F43.8) toclassify the closely related terms: clinical burnout, vitalexhaustion, and mental fatigue. As proposed byA \u02dasbergand co-workers, burnout should not be considered anecessary or suf\ufb01cient condition for developing stress-related disease. Rather, it is a process or coping strategyto endure challenging situations at work that may leadto disease or exhaustion syndrome (Asberg et al. 2010).Since there is no international consensus on this issue,we have used the term work-related LTSL in this study.The symptoms of individuals on work-related LTSLoverlap with core symptoms of major depression(Wahlberg et al. 2009), which has prompted examin-ations of whether individuals on LTSL due to workstress and patients with major depression share HPAaxis pathophysiology (Rydmark et al. 2006). Thoughmajor depression has been associated with up-regulated reactivity of the HPA axis, patients withstress were found to exhibit a marked decrease in thereactivity of the HPA axis (Wahlberg et al. 2009). In thesame study, no support was obtained for a reduction inhippocampal volume, and cognitive impairment wasmore indicative of a disruption of the frontocorticalsystem rather than hippocampus dysfunction. We andothers have reported a similar pattern of neurocogni-tive alterations in stressed patients, with evidence offrontal cognitive de\ufb01cits (Sandstrom et al. 2005) andintact hippocampal volume (Sandstrom et al. 2011).In contrast, major depression has repeatedly beenassociated with lowered performance on hippocampal-dependent explicit/episodic memory tasks (Airaksinenet al. 2004) and reduced hippocampal volume(Videbech and Ravnkilde 2004).Collectively, these \ufb01ndings suggest differencesbetween major depression and chronic stress. Inparticular, individuals on LTSL due to work stresstend to exhibit frontal, rather than hippocampal,dysfunction. This view is in line with a notion of thestress\u2013brain link that implicates many cortical andsubcortical regions other than the hippocampus,including the frontal cortex (Lupien and Lepage2001). Converging evidence indicates that not onlyaffective but also cognitive regions in the frontal lobesare dysfunctional in major depression (Steele et al.2007), and patients suffering from major depressionexhibit a pattern of cognitive dysfunction that extendsbeyond the domain of explicit/episodic memory toexecutive, frontal lobe-sensitive tasks (Stordal et al.2004; Dahlin et al. 2008). Furthermore, imagingstudies have suggested an increased activity in thesubgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC) inpatients with depression, which is decreased bysuccessful treatment (Mayberg et al. 2003, 2005).Direct, within-study, comparisons of patients onLTSL due to work stress and patients with majordepression are critical for addressing the questions ofwhether these two categories re\ufb02ect a shared or distinctpathophysiology. To date, such studies are rare and, tothe best of our knowledge, no prior study hascompared the functional brain responses of patientsfrom each category while engaged in memory tasks.The main objective of this study was to comparefunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)patterns and diurnal cortisol across three groups:(i) controls, (ii) acute unmedicated patients withunipolar major depression, and (iii) patients onLTSL due to work stress. During fMRI scanning,the participants alternated between a baseline task, ann-back working memory protocol known to reliablyelicit frontal activity (Dahlin et al. 2008), and thecontinuous visual memory task (CVMT) that hasbeen related to hippocampal activity (Yassa andStark 2008). First, we assessed similarities anddifferences in task-related fMRI activity among groupsusing a multivariate partial least squares (PLS)analysis (McIntosh and Lobaugh 2004; Salami et al.2010), and then conducted univariate contrastsguided by the multivariate \ufb01ndings. We predictedgroup differences in engagement of prefrontal cortex,such that the stress group would under-recruit somefrontal regions. In addition, the diurnal rhythm ofsaliva cortisol and the cortisol response to thedexamethasone suppression test (DST) was investi-gated using saliva samples. We predicted thatdepressed patients would have higher cortisol levels,especially after dexamethasone (DEX).A. Sandstro \u00a8m et al. 504Methods and materialsSubjectsA total of 30 females participated in the study, 10 ineach group: work stress-related LTSL, unipolar majordepression, and healthy controls (Table I). Thedepressed patients were recruited from the psychiatricclinic at Norrland\u2019s University Hospital. The stresspatients were recruited from the stress clinic at thesame hospital and were part of a larger study(Stenlund et al. 2009), which aimed at exploringwork-related long-term stress.Exclusion criteria were left-handedness or ambi-dextrousness, co-morbid psychiatric disorders, knownabuse of alcohol or drugs, endocrinological diseases,and neurological disorders. Subjects who were notmenstruating were also excluded. All participantswere native Swedish speakers. For the stress group,additional exclusion criteria were other diseases thatcould result in fatigue and/or stress-related symptoms,other diseases that cause future sick leave, otherdiseases or treatments that can interfere with activeparticipation, post-traumatic stress disorder, unem-ployment for more than 2 years prior to participation,speech and language dif\ufb01culties, and a need forindividual therapy.The patients with depression and the controls wereall medication-na\u0131 \u00a8ve. In the work stress-related LTSLgroup, four patients were taking selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors. None of the stress patients weretaking tricyclic anti-depressants.The study was approved by the Ethics Committeefor Medical Research at Norrland\u2019s UniversityHospital. All patients provided informed writtenconsent after having the procedure and objective ofthe study carefully explained to them and after theopportunity to ask questions. Subjects were not paidfor their participation.Clinical assessmentsThe depressed patients were assessed by a clinicallyexperienced psychologist (RS). The interviewsreviewed clinical and demographic information, andthe obtained data were used to con\ufb01rm or reject adiagnosis of unipolar major depressive disorderaccording to DSM-IV. Depression severity wasmeasured with the Montgomery\u2013A \u02dasberg depressionrating scale (MADRS) (Montgomery and Asberg1979; Svanborg and Asberg 1994). To be includedin the depression group, participants had to havea minimum score of 20, which re\ufb02ects moderate tosevere depression. All of the depressed patients wereeither on sick leave or otherwise incapable to work dueto the severity of their symptoms.The stress patients were subjected to medicaland psychological examinations to con\ufb01rm thediagnosis of burnout (Schaufeli and EnzmannTable I.

LTSL, long-term sickleave; PSQ, perceived stress questionnaire; HAS, Hamilton anxiety score; MADRS, Montgomery\u2013A \u02dasberg depression rating scale.Brain activity in depression and stress 5051998). The patients were required to have been oncontinuous sick leave for burnout and stress-relateddisorder $25% of their working hours for at least 3months and to have an average score of $4.6 on theShirom Melamed burnout questionnaire (Kushnirand Melamed 1992; Melamed et al. 1992, 1999).All subjects were assessed with the MADRS,the Hamilton anxiety scale (HAS), the perceivedstress questionnaire (PSQ), and the burnout inventory(BI) on the day of the fMRI examination. Groupcharacteristics are presented in Table I.All self-rating scales and measurements of psychia-tric health used in this work are well known, validated,and reliable with excellent Cronbach\u2019sa. MADRS is awidely used questionnaire to measure severity ofdepression. It is sensitive to change and thereforecommon in treatment studies. MADRS Cronbach\u2019savaries between 0.80 and 0.90 (Montgomery andAsberg 1979). The HAS is considered a gold standardquestionnaire designed to assess anxiety symptomsregardless of diagnosis. It is sensitive to change and isfrequently used in clinical trials. Cronbach\u2019sarangingbetween 0.77 and 0.99 has been reported in differentstudies (Hamilton 1959). PSQ is a self-assessment-based instrument for recording subjective perceivedstress (Cronbach\u2019sa.0.90) (Levenstein et al. 1993).The BI is designed to assess components of theburnout syndrome: emotional exhaustion, deperso-nalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Itsreported internal consistency/Cronbach\u2019sarangesbetween 0.71 and 0.90.fMRI procedure . fMRI was used to assess brainresponses while the subjects performed two cognitivetasks: the n-back task and a visual long-term memorytask. Additionally, during the fMRI session, a low-demand baseline condition was modeled as a blockdesign to achieve similar sensorimotor activation asthe experimental tasks.The n-back task is a commonly used workingmemory task in fMRI studies. Subjects are presenteda series of stimuli and required to respond if thecurrent stimulus matches the stimulus displayednsteps earlier in the sequence. In our version, singlewords were displayed and the subjects were askedto indicate whether the displayed word was the sameas or different from the one displayed two wordsearlier (2-back).The visual long-term memory task consisted of a setof black and white abstract and non-verbal picturesdrawn from the CVMT (Larrabee et al. 1992). Thepictures were displayed one at a time and the subjectswere told to respond \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d as to whether theyrecognized the picture from earlier presentations (i.e.a continuous recognition test).For both tasks, responses were given by pressingone of two buttons using the right or left index \ufb01nger.In the baseline condition, the letters \u201cxxxxx\u201d weredisplayed on the computer screen either to the left orto the right side, and the subjects were told to press thebutton on the corresponding side. All stimuli (2-backwords, pictures, or letters) were displayed for 2.5 s,followed by a 0.5 s \ufb01xation cross, and all blocksconsisted of 16 stimuli. The blocked task paradigmalternated between the baseline condition, the 2-backcondition, and the visual memory condition, and thiswas repeated in \ufb01ve sessions in a sequential order.Stimuli were presented in the same order to allsubjects during all sessions. Behavioral performancewas recorded for reaction times and responseaccuracy. Prior to fMRI scanning, subjects wereinstructed and underwent a trial version of the taskto ensure that they had understood the instructions.Data collection was performed using a 1.5 T PhilipsIntera scanner (Philips Medical Systems, theNetherlands). Functional T2 *-weighted images werecollected with a single-shot, gradient echo EPIsequence used for blood oxygen level-dependentimaging. The sequence had the following parameters:echo time 50 ms, repetition time 3000 ms, \ufb02ip angle908, \ufb01eld of view 22 \u00a322 cm, 64 \u00a364 matrix, and slicethickness 3.9 mm. Thirty-three slices were acquiredevery 3.0 s. To eliminate signals arising fromprogressive saturation, \ufb01ve dummy scans wereperformed prior to image acquisition. Cushions andheadphones in the scanner were used to reduce headmovement, dampen scanner noise, and communicatewith the subjects. The stimuli were presented on asemi-transparent screen, which the subjects viewedthrough a tilted mirror attached to the head coil.Presentation and reaction times were handled by aPC running E-Prime 1.0 (Psychology Software Tools,PA, USA). Responses were collected with \ufb01ber opticresponse boxes, one in each hand (Lumitouch replysystem, Lightwave Medical Industries, Canada). Afterthe functional imaging, high-resolution T1- andT2-weighted structural images were acquired.Routine analyses . Subjects and controls were screenedin a fasting state at 08:00 h with routine venousblood sampling (5 ml) for each individual for lateranalyses of full blood count, liver and kidney functiontests, and thyroid hormones at the clinical chemistrylaboratory (University Hospital of Umea \u02da, Sweden).Cortisol analyses . HPA axis tests were performed within10 days after cessation of a menstrual bleeding (i.e.during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle).Study subjects were supplied with marked test tubeand instructed to spit in the tubes at 07:00, 11:00,16:00, 19:00, and 23:00 h. This was followed by a low-dose DST in which subjects ingested 0.25 mg DEX(DecadronwMSD) after the 23:00 h saliva sample.A. Sandstro \u00a8m et al. 506On the following morning, a saliva sample wascollected at 07:00 h for estimations of cortisol. Nofood, tobacco, or tooth brushing was allowed duringthe hour preceding sampling. Saliva cortisol wasanalyzed at the clinical chemistry laboratory,University Hospital of Umea \u02da, by radioimmunoassayfrom Spectra, Orion Diagnostica, Finland, accordingto the manufacturer\u2019s procedure for salivary cortisol.The coef\ufb01cient of variances (CVs) were ,12% forsaliva cortisol with an analytical detection limit of0.8 nmol/l, according to the manufacturer.Data and statistical analysesPre-processing of fMRI data .T h ef M R Ii m a g e swere sent to a PC and converted to Analyze format.The images were then pre-processed and analyzedusing SPM2 (Wellcome Department of CognitiveNeurology, UK) implemented in Matlab 7.1( M a t h w o r k s ,I n c . ,M A ,U S A ) .D u r i n gt h ep r e -processing steps, the images were corrected for slicetiming to adjust for acquisition time differencesbetween slices and subsequently realigned to the \ufb01rstvolume to account for subjects movement. The imageswere then normalized to a standard anatomic spacede\ufb01ned by the MNI Atlas (SPM2) and \ufb01nally spatiallysmoothed using an 8.0-mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian \ufb01lter kernel.Multivariate analysis of fMRI data . PLS re\ufb02ects time-varying distributed patterns in the brain (as a functionof a task) without any assumption about howconditions collate to form a pattern and shape of thehemodynamic response function (HRF). A detaileddescription of how task PLS can be applied to fMRIdata can be found in earlier studies (Salami et al.2010). In short, a data matrix is constructed tofacilitate the operation of PLS on the entire data. Thismatrix is subjected to mean centering, followed bysingular value decomposition (SVD), to produceorthogonal latent variables (LVs). Each LV containsvoxel/design saliencies and brain scores. The latterre\ufb02ects the strength of the contribution of each subjectto the LV, whereas the former re\ufb02ects brain activationrelated to the experimental design. The signi\ufb01cance ofeach LV, indicating whether the overall pattern isdifferent from randomness, was assessed by apermutation test (McIntosh and Lobaugh 2004).Using PLS, it is feasible to extract the commonality aswell as the differences of brain activations acrossdifferent groups. Here, the critical interest was toinvestigate whether there were any group differencesin brain activity in relation to the three tasks.Behavioral PLS analyzes the relationship betweenthe behavioral measures (e.g. reaction times) and thefunctional brain activity of groups. The procedure isroughly the same as the one described above for taskPLS, but instead of mean centering, a correlationanalysis is conducted between the data and behavioralmeasures. As such behavioral saliencies were obtainedfrom SVD indicating task-dependent differences inthe brain\u2013behavior correlation. A similar pattern ofscores depicting experimental differences in behaviorcan be obtained by conducting a correlation betweenthe brain scores and each behavioral measure. Thecon\ufb01dence interval (CI) around a brain\u2013behaviorcorrelation reveals its reliability.Univariate analysis of fMRI data . Each condition (2-back, visual long-term memory task, and baseline) wasmodeled as a \ufb01xed response (boxcar) waveformconvolved with the HRF. Single-subject statisticalcontrasts (the 2-back task vs. baseline and the visualrecognition task vs. baseline) were generated (inSPM5) using a voxel-wise general linear model.Contrast images for each subject at each sessionwere taken into the second-level random effectanalysis (one-sample t-test) to identify regionsactivated across the groups for each model. Thereported activations were signi\ufb01cant at a voxel level ofp,0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons,with an extent of .5 contiguous voxels.Other data . Data are shown as mean ^1 standarddeviation or means ^SEM (standard error of mean),as indicated in the text. Non-parametric statistics(Kruskal\u2013Wallis) with Bonferroni corrections wasused to test for group differences. Repeated measuresanalysis (ANOVA) for the 07:00 and 11:00 hassessments of saliva cortisol was used to assessputative group by time interactions. A pvalue,0.05was considered statistically signi\ufb01cant. SPSS v14.0was used for the univariate statistical analyses.ResultsBehavioral variablesThe average MADRS, PSQ, and burnout scoreswere highest in the depression group (Table I). Allmeasurements of psychological health in thedepression group were signi\ufb01cantly different fromthe control group as well as the work-related LTSLgroup. All depressed subjects and \ufb01ve LTSL subjectshad MADRS scores above the depression limit of20, whereas none of the controls had MADRSscores over 20. A signi\ufb01cant difference in the HASwas found between controls and the patient groups,but no signi\ufb01cant difference was found between thedepressed patients and individuals on LTSL.Patients with depression were signi\ufb01cantly youngerthan controls and individuals on LTSL. The PSQand MADRS scores also signi\ufb01cantly differed amongBrain activity in depression and stress 507groups (Table I). Burnout scores and HAS did notdiffer between patient groups but separated controlsfrom the two patient groups.Overall, all groups performed the memory tasks witha high level of accuracy during fMRI. The patientgroups, particularly the stress group, tended to haveslower reaction times than controls. This slowing wasparticularly marked for the n-back working memorytask, but did not reach statistical signi\ufb01cance (Table II).Brain imagingThe multivariate PLS analysis revealed two signi-\ufb01cant patterns ( p,0.0001, Figure 1) that werehighly similar across the three groups, suggestinga high degree of similarity in the functional brainpatterns of patients and controls. However, somegroup differences were also observed.The \ufb01rst LV accounted for 46% of the cross-blockcovariance and delineated a main effect of memorytask (i.e. n-back/CVMT vs. baseline; Figure 1). Theeffect was most pronounced for the visual CVMT,and occipital regions were found to contribute to theeffect, re\ufb02ecting a stronger engagement of visual areasduring the processing of complex pictures comparedto strings of Xs. For controls and depressed patients,then-back task also signi\ufb01cantly contributed to theeffect, but this was not the case for the stress patients(the CI for the n-back task in the LTSL group crossedzero; Figure 1). Prefrontal regions, mainly in the righthemisphere, contributed to the effect expressed byLV1 (Figure 1, top row), thus indicating lesserinvolvement of prefrontal regions in the n-back forstress patients. This interpretation was examined inmore detail in the univariate analyses reported below.The second pattern (Figure 1, bottom row), whichaccounted for 29.5% of the cross-block covariance,mainly re\ufb02ected a difference between the twocognitive tasks ( n-back vs. CVMT). During then-back task, a well-characterized frontoparietal net-work was activated (Figure 1, bottom row; red),whereas dorsal occipital and temporal polar regionswere differentially more engaged during CVMT, andto some degree during the baseline task (Figure 1,bottom row; blue). This effect was similarly expressedacross all three groups.The univariate SPM analyses involved groupcomparisons of n-back vs. baseline and CVMTvs. baseline. On the basis of the multivariate analysis,we expected weak or no group differences for CVMT,but some differences for n-back. This predictionwas con\ufb01rmed by lack of signi\ufb01cant group differencesfor CVMT along with a signi\ufb01cant group differenceforn-back. The latter difference was expressed inthe left frontal cortex during n-back when the controlsand depressed patients were combined into one groupand compared with the LTSL group (Figure 2A).A difference was also seen in the right dorsolateralprefrontal cortex, which was engaged by controls andpatients with major depression but not by the stresspatients (Figure 2B).Taken together, the fMRI results revealed pro-nounced similarities in activation patterns acrossthe groups, indicating largely preserved functionalnetworks in the patients. However, during the n-backtask, the LTSL subjects tended to under-recruitregions in the prefrontal cortex.Diurnal cortisol rhythmThe diurnal salivary cortisol concentration and DSTdid not reveal any overall differences between groups(Figure 3). However, the diurnal curve of the LTSLgroup had a tendency toward \ufb02attening. This effectwas pronounced between the 07:00 am and 11:00 amrecordings, as re\ufb02ected by a signi\ufb01cant group (controlsvs. stress patients) by time (07:00 vs. 11:00 h)interaction in an ANOVA [ F(15)\u00bc4.65; p\u00bc0.03].Brain\u2013cognition correlationsDue to the observation of altered brain activity inLTSL patients during n-back (Figure 1), we analyzedindividual differences in response times during n-backin relation to brain activity (behavioral PLS).

For LV1, the most reliable regions re\ufb02ecting the main effect of memory tasks vs. baseline were leftmiddle occipital ( x,y,z:216,2103, 8; BSR \u00bc8.99; 509 voxels) and right cuneus ( x,y,z: 14,2101, 12; BSR \u00bc6.82; 489 voxels). For LV2,the most reliable regions in the positive direction, expressing the effect of 2-back vs. visual memory, were left inferior occipital ( x,y,z:216,294,26; BSR \u00bc8.48; 2652 voxels) and right middle frontal ( x,y,z: 34, 56, 14; BSR \u00bc8.42; 2076 voxels) cortex, whereas the most reliableregions in the negative direction, indicating the effect of visual memory vs. 2-back, were middle occipital cortex ( x,y,z: 30,286, 19;BSR\u00bc214.05; 13,002 voxels). Note that the pattern as a whole is more important than one speci\ufb01c region alone.Brain activity in depression and stress 509DiscussionThe main objective of this study was to comparememory-related brain activity patterns and diurnalcortisol between acute unmedicated patients withunipolar major depression and patients on LTSL dueto work stress. Of main interest was to examinewhether LTSL patients under-recruited parts offrontal cortex during cognitive processing.The fMRI results showed pronounced similarities inactivation patterns across the groups, suggestinglargely intact functional networks. This was furthersubstantiated by intact cognitive performance.However, during the more demanding cognitive task(n-back), the LTSL subjects showed a reductionin prefrontal cortex activation. Speci\ufb01cally, a groupdifference was observed in the right dorsolateraland left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. In addition,response times during n-back correlated with brainactivity for controls and depressed patients but not forthe LTSL subjects, who tended to have a slowerresponse. This pattern of slowed response andreduced frontal activity in patients with stress disorderis consistent with previous \ufb01ndings that patients withstress exhibit reduced performance on cognitivelydemanding tasks that are assumed to re\ufb02ect theintegrity of frontal lobe functioning (Rydmark et al.2006; Ohman et al. 2007; Sandstrom et al. 2011).In particular, the \ufb01ndings from the brain\u2013cognitioncorrelation analysis are indicative of alterations offunctional working memory networks in LTSLpatients. Still, as this observation was found in amore exploratory analysis and was based on arelatively small group of patients, further generali-zations must await future replication.More generally, the present \ufb01ndings are in line withthe view that the frontal cortex may be as critical as thehippocampus when it comes to the regulation ofstress (Lupien et al. 2009). Notably, this is a dualrelationship, as the medial prefrontal cortex as well asthe hippocampus may be an important target forglucocorticoid actions (Herman et al. 2005). Indeed,a recent study has shown that chronic stress or chronicadministration of glucocorticoids produces dendriticremodeling in prefrontal pyramidal neurons (Martinand Wellman 2011).The diurnal saliva cortisol curve for the LTSLpatients showed a trend toward \ufb02attening with highercortisol levels at 11:00 h, whereas controls anddepressed patients had similar diurnal patterns. Itremains to be determined if a blunted diurnal cortisolrhythm relates to changes in frontal cortex function.Previous work on the effect of glucocorticoids on010207 11 16 19 23 Post DexSaliva cortisol (mmol/l)Sampling times hoursMajor depression n=7Work stress related LTSL n=8Controls n=8Figure 3.

The singular images are overlaid on a standard MRItemplate.A. Sandstro \u00a8m et al. 510Figure 4. Behavioral pattern, singular image, and correlation overview for the only signi\ufb01cant behavioral PLS LV1 ( p,0.005). The top rowdemonstrates the behavioral LV that expressed a contrast, indicating task-dependent group differences in the brain\u2013behavior correlation. Thesecond row shows the brain regions (overlaid on a standard MRI template) that negatively correlated with behavioral measures. The mostreliable regions in the positive and negative directions were right middle frontal ( x,y,z: 46,22, 56; BSR \u00bc9.59; 1531 voxels) and left fusiform(x,y,z:236,256,28; BSR \u00bc24.38; 11 voxels) cortex, respectively. The bottom row shows the correlation overview in scatter plots,re\ufb02ecting the correlation between brain scores and reaction times for the 2-back task within LV1. The correlation was signi\ufb01cant ( r\u00bc20.73;r\u00bc20.80) for the \ufb01rst two columns (control and depression groups), but was roughly zero for the third column (stress group).Brain activity in depression and stress 511memory function showed that they lead to de\ufb01cits incognitive tasks sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction(working memory), but do not impact cognitivefunctions sensitive to hippocampal damage. Notably,repeated cortisol measurements across several days,including different weekdays, might provideadditional insight. Also, estimation of the cortisolawakening response be of interest, since severalstudies have suggested an altered awakening responsein different neuropsychiatric conditions (Kudielka andWust 2010). We did not \ufb01nd any difference in DEXsuppression between depressed subjects and controls.This is of interest and suggests that short-termexposure to a depressive state may be less related tofailure of \u201cshut-off\u201d of the HPA axis. Indeed, the totallength of depression periods may be an importantpredictor of hippocampal dysfunction/volume whichmay relate to dysfunctional feedback function in theHPA axis. The number of participants in this studywas also insuf\ufb01cient to reveal subgroups of depressedpatients with different HPA axis activity. It has alsobeen suggested that age of onset for depression mayin\ufb02uence hippocampal function/volume, but this is amatter of controversy (MacQueen and Frodl 2011).The healthy subjects and depressed patients showedmarked similarities in brain activation patterns,despite the fact that depressed subjects indicatedpoorer health in all measures of subjective well-being.Notably, the depressed group did not show theincreased sACC activity that has been reported earlierby Mayberg et al. (1999) and Mayberg (2003). Thesediscrepancies may be related to the fact that thedepressed patients in this study were recentlydiagnosed. Repeated episodes of major depression,as well as the severity of episodes, are known tocorrelate with structural and functional changes in thebrain, possibly re\ufb02ecting hypersecretion of glucocor-ticoids (Sapolsky 2000). Taken together, the amountof time a person is sick might be a crucial factor fordeveloping changes in frontal lobe functioning.Importantly, we wanted to avoid treatment withanxiolytics and other substances known to in\ufb02uencecognitive function, thereby creating another possibleconfounder. An additional possible confounder is theyounger age of the depressed group vs. the LTSLgroup in our study. Finally, it is possible that the highscores in experienced stress and burnout in ourdepressed group raise the possibility that some of themare suffering from work-related stress.In summary, the present \ufb01ndings suggest adifference between patient categories, such thatlong-term stress relative to acute depression induceschanges in functional brain activity, notably in areaswithin the frontal cortex, as well as a \ufb02attening of thediurnal cortisol curve. These \ufb01ndings need to bevalidated in future studies with larger samples, alsoincluding men. Future studies should also explorewhether functional and cognitive dysfunction, asshown in this study, is reversible by variousinterventions.AcknowledgmentsAS and RS contributed equally to this article.
