Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) enhance the risk for MDD and can contribute to disturbances in the stress systems,including cortisol and cognitive functions. In healthy participants, cortisol administration as well as acute stress can affect cognitive per-formance. In the current study, we tested cognitive performance in MDD patients with ( N= 32) and without ( N= 52) ACE and healthyparticipants with ( N= 22) and without ( N= 37) ACE after psychosocial stress induction (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) and a control con-dition (Placebo-TSST). MDD predicted lower performance in verbal learning and both selective and sustained attention, while ACE pre-dicted lower performance in psychomotoric speed and working memory. There were no interaction effects of MDD and ACE. After stress,MDD patients were more likely to show lower performance in working memory as well as in selective and sustained attention comparedwith participants without MDD. Individuals with ACE were more likely to show lower performance in verbal memory after stress comparedwith individuals without ACE. Our results indicate negative effects of MDD and ACE on distinct cognitive domains. Furthermore, MDDand/or ACE seem to enhance susceptibility for stress-related cognitive impairments.Keywords: adverse childhood experiences, attention, major depressive disorder, memory, trier social stress test(Received 31 October 2018; revised 17 March 2019; accepted 11 May 2019)IntroductionCognitive dysfunction is a highly relevant symptom dimension ofmajor depressive disorder (MDD) (Millan et al., 2012 ) because itseverely compromises quality of life and complicates remission.Cognitive domains that are predominantly affected include mem-ory, executive function, and attention (Rock, Roiser, Riedel, &Blackwell, 2014 ).Interestingly, evidence has been accumulated that cognitivesymptoms of MDD, especially impairments in memory and execu-tive function, might be associated with elevated cortisol levels(Behnken et al., 2013; Gomez et al., 2006; Hinkelmann et al.,2009,2013;O\u2019Hara et al., 2007; Schlosser et al., 2011).Maladaptive changes in the stress systems have been found fre-quently in MDD patients, including alterations of the hypothalamuspituitary adrenal (HPA) axis with higher basal cortisol release andreduced feedback sensitivity. Reduced glucocorticoid receptor(GR) functions have been suggested as an underlying mechanism(Calfa et al., 2003; Holsboer, 2000; Pariante & Lightman, 2008;Parker, Schatzberg, & Lyons, 2003;W a t e r se ta l . , 2015; Webster,Knable, O \u2019Grady, Orthmann, & Weickert, 2002).In accordance with the hypothesis of reduced GR sensitivity inMDD patients, previous studies from our group demonstratedthat acute cortisol administration took effect on cognitive perfor-mance, with lower performance in working memory and retrievaland better performance in response inhibition in healthy controlparticipants but not in MDD patients (Schlosser et al., 2010 ;Schlosser et al., 2013 ; Terfehr et al., 2011a ,2011b ). To someextent, these pharmacological manipulations also mimic parts ofthe biological stress response.However, a whole stress response is a complex interplay ofrelated hormone and immune system factors. This explains whydivergent effects of stress induction versus cortisol administrationon cognitive performance (e.g., executive functions) were alsofound in previous studies (Shields, Sazma, & Yonelinas, 2016 ).Since stress-related factors such as socioenvironmental eventsplay an important role for the risk and outcome of MDD (Otteet al., 2016 ), it is of importance to understand the effects ofacute stress on cognitive performance in these patients. Severalstudies investigated the effects of acute psychosocial stress on cog-nitive performance in healthy participants (Domes, Heinrichs,Reichwald, & Hautzinger, 2002 ; Jiang & Rau, 2017 ; Luethi,Meier, & Sandi, 2008 ; Olver, Pinney, Maruff, & Norman, 2015 ;Schoofs, Preuss, & Wolf, 2008 ). The results of these studies varyAuthor for Correspondence: Linn K.

Stress effects on cognitive function in patients with major depres-sive disorder: Does childhood trauma play a role? Development and Psychopathology 32,1007\u20131016. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579419000932Development and Psychopathology (2020), 32, 1007 \u20131016doi:10.1017/S0954579419000932https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579419000932  Published online by Cambridge University Pressbetween different cognitive domains and show impairing effectsof acute psychosocial stress on working memory (Jiang & Rau,2017 ; Luethi, et al., 2008 ; Olver, et al., 2015 ; Schoofs, et al.,2008 ) and attention (Olver, et al., 2015 ), improvement of spatialmemory (Luethi, et al., 2008 ) and mixed results for verbal mem-ory (Domes, et al., 2002 ; Luethi, et al., 2008 ; Olver, et al., 2015 ).Comparable studies are missing in MDD patients. However,since important changes in the stress systems have been foundin these patients, an acute stress induction, such as psychosocialstress, might have different effects on MDD patients than onhealthy control participants as well.One important factor that might contribute to maladaptivechanges in the stress systems is severe early stress experiences,or adverse childhood experiences (ACE) such as physical or sex-ual abuse. Such experiences increase the risk for MDD, but mightalso have persistent effects on the stress systems (Otte et al., 2016 ).Furthermore, ACE have been associated with diminished cogni-tive performance later in life (Hedges & Woon, 2011 ; Lovalloet al., 2013 ; Pechtel & Pizzagalli, 2011 ; Pesonen et al., 2013 ).Therefore, it seems of great importance to take the potentialrole of ACE into account when associations of stress and cognitivefunctions are investigated in MDD patients.With the current study, we intended to systematically investi-gate the effect of a psychosocial stress induction on cognitive per-formance in different cognitive domains in individuals with MDDand ACE. To disentangle potential effects of MDD and ACE,MDD patients with and without ACE and healthy participantswith and without ACE were included using a full factorial designwith the factors MDD and ACE as predictors for cognitive perfor-mance after stress. For psychosocial stress induction, we chose theTrier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum, Pirke, &Hellhammer, 1993 ) to administer to experimental groups to com-pare their cognitive performance with participants in aPlacebo-TSST group. We expected the largest effects of the stressintervention on cognitive performance for the combination ofMDD and ACE factors.Methods and materialParticipantsTo investigate the potential effects of MDD and ACE, we recruitedwomen with MDD and ACE (MDD + / ACE +; N= 32); withMDD but without ACE (MDD + / ACE -; N= 52); with ACEbut no current or lifetime MDD (MDD - / ACE +; N= 22); andwomen who had never had any mental disorder and did notreport sexual or physical abuse (MDD - / ACE -; N= 37). ACEwas defined as repeated sexual or physical abuse at least once amonth over a period of one year or more (Heim, Ehlert, &Hellhammer, 2000 ) before the age of 18 years.On the first study day, all participants underwent a comprehen-sive clinical assessment. This a ssessment included the StructuredClinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I and II to validate psychiatricdiagnoses and a semistructured interview, the Early TraumaInventory (ETI; Bremner, Vermetten, & Mazure, 2000;W i n g e n f e l det al., 2011)a n dt h eC h i l d h o o dT r a u m aQ u e s t i o n n a i r e( C T Q ;Bernstein et al., 2003;W i n g e n f e l de ta l . , 2010) to assess ACE.All patients of the MDD groups met the diagnostic criteria forcurrent major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV, assessedby SCID-I (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I dis-orders). Exclusion criteria for the MDD groups were bipolar dis-order, depressive disorder with psychotic features, schizophrenia,schizoaffective disorder, anorexia, and alcohol or drug depen-dence. Current depressive symptoms were assessed by a clinicalinterview, the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale(MADRS; Montgomery & Asberg, 1979 ; Williams & Kobak,2008 ), and a self-rating questionnaire (Beck DepressionInventory (BDI; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996 ). Healthy participantswith and without ACE were free of any current mental disorder.Additional exclusion criteria for all participants were severesomatic diseases, CNS or autoimmune diseases, metabolic orendocrine diseases, current infections, pregnancy, or a bodymass index (BMI) above 30.Participants were recruited from our affective disorder clinicsand by public posting. Healthy controls were recruited via(online) advertisement.All participants provided written informed consent. Healthycontrol participants and outpatients received monetary compen-sation ( \u20ac200) for their participation. The study was approved bythe local ethical committee.ProceduresThe study protocol included two experimental sessions beginningat 5 p.m. At baseline, salivary samples for analyses of cortisol andalpha-amylase were collected (Salivettes\u00ae, blue cap; Sarstedt,Germany) and blood pressure as well as heart rate were measuredwith an automatic blood pressure monitor for upper arm mea-surement (Boso Medicus Uno, Bosch + Sohn GmbH u. Co KG)at 0 and +15 minutes. In quasi-randomized order, a psychosocialstress test (TSST) or a control task (P-TSST) was conducted onthe first or the second day, respectively. Afterwards, two post-stress salivary samples (+30 and +40 minutes) were collectedand blood pressure as well as heart rate were measured. Thirtyminutes after the TSST or P-TSST, neuropsychological testingtook place and saliva samples were collected before and after neu-ropsychological testing (+60 and +75 minutes). Blood pressureand heart rate were measured as well. During the break betweenTSST and neuropsychological testing, participants were invitedto consume food from a standardized buffet as a separate partof this study, with results reported elsewhere (Wingenfeld et al.,2017 ). There was no difference in the number of consumed calo-ries between groups or between TSST and P-TSST conditions.Apart from the buffet, participants were instructed not to eatafter 1 p.m.Stress inductionWe used the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) as a standardized psy-chosocial stress test and the Placebo-TSST (P-TSST) as the con-trol condition (Het, Rohleder, Schoofs, Kirschbaum, & Wolf,2009 ). The TSST reliably induces activation of the HPA axisand consists of three phases: preparation, a speech in front of atrained audience, and an arithmetic task (5 minutes each). TheP-TSST is designed to be as similar as possible to the TSST with-out being stressful to the participant. In an empty room, the par-ticipant is asked to talk aloud about a topic of his/her choice aftera preparation phase and to do an easy arithmetic task afterwards.We have described the TSST procedure and important outcomevariables in more detail in Wingenfeld et al. ( 2017 ).Neuropsychological testingNeuropsychological tests were conducted 30 minutes after theTSST or Placebo-TSST and comprised the Auditory Verbal1008 Linn K. Kuehl et al.https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579419000932  Published online by Cambridge University PressLearning Test, the Trail Making Test A and B (TMT-A, TMT-B),the letter cancellation test (d2), and the Digit Span Test. All neu-ropsychological tests were administered by trained psychologists.Auditory verbal learning test (AVLT; Lezak, Howieson, Loring,Hannay, & Fischer, 1995 )The AVLT measures short- and long-term verbal memory. Forfive times, the experimenter reads a list of 15 words (list A),which the participant is requested to repeat in loose order (verballearning). Then, the participant is asked to reproduce words froma newly presented list (list B) as a distractor. Following this, theparticipant is asked to recall the words from list A withoutrenewed presentation (immediate recall). After 30 min, the partic-ipant is instructed to repeat the words from list A again withoutrenewed presentation (delayed recall). Outcome measures werethe amount of recalled words of Trial 5 (measure of verbal learn-ing) and the percentage of recalled words based on the number ofrecalled words in the delayed trial (delayed recall after 30 min)compared with Trial 5.Trail-making test (TMT; Reitan, 1992 )With the TMT part A, psychomotoric speed is assessed. In thistask, the participant has to connect encircled numbers in ascend-ing order as quickly as possible. With part B, executive function isalso assessed. This test requires the alternation between numbersand letters in ascending order. The score of each part is repre-sented by the time needed to complete the task. Additionally,the difference score (B minus A) reflects switch costs, a relativelypure indicator of executive function (Sanchez-Cubillo et al.,2009 ).Forward and backward digit span (Tewes, 1991 )This test is part of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS).During the forward digit span task, participants are asked toremember a series of digits and to repeat them in the sameorder. During the backward digit span task, participants areasked to repeat the digits in reverse order. The number of cor-rectly remembered digits is a measure of working memory.Test d2 (Brickenkamp, 1978 )The Test d2 is a letter cancellation test that measures selective andsustained attention. On a paper with rows of target and distractorstimuli, the participant is instructed to cross out the letter \u201cd\u201dwhenever it is accompanied by two small lines; d \u2019s with moreor less than two lines or any stimuli containing the character\u201cp\u201dserve as distracters. After a practice trial, there are 14 rowswith target and distracter stimuli. The number of correctly iden-tified items serves as an indicator of selective attention, the differ-ence of correctly identified items minus wrongly identified itemsis a measure of sustained attention.Data analysisDemographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed withANOVA for continuous variables or a chi-squared test for dichot-omous variables.We analyzed whether the TSST evoked an increased stressresponse compared with the P-TSST. For cortisol andalpha-amylase, we additionally computed the area under thecurve with respect to increase (AUCi) (Pruessner, Kirschbaum,Meinlschmid, & Hellhammer, 2003 ). Because both variableswere not normally distributed, we log-transformed raw valuesand conducted 2 \u00d7 4 repeated measures ANOVAs with the factorsStress (TSST vs. P-TSST) and Group (MDD-/ ACE-; MDD-/ ACE+; MDD+/ ACE-; MDD+/ ACE+) for statistical analyses. The twoAUCi variables served also as predictors in the models describedbelow. Further analyses of biological and subjective stressresponses are presented in detail in Wingenfeld et al. ( 2017 ).We used mixed-model linear regression analyses (unstructuredcovariance type, maximum likelihood method) to analyze theinfluence of the factors MDD and ACE on neuropsychologicalperformance after the stress (TSST) and non-stress (P-TSST)induction conditions. The outcome measure of each neuro-psychological test served as the dependent variable. For thecomputations, MDD, ACE, and Stress (repeated factor) weredefined as fixed factors in model I. To control for cortisol andalpha-amylase response, we included the AUCi of cortisoland alpha-amylase as covariates in addition to the fixedfactors MDD and ACE in model II. Akaike\u00b4s InformationCriterion ( AIC) was used to assess model fit for each outcomevariable.In a follow-up analysis, we investigated whether antidepressantmedication had an effect on cognitive performance in our study.Within the depressive participants, we calculated a 2 \u00d7 2 ANOVAfor each dependent variable with the factors ACE ( yes/no )xMedication ( yes/no ). For explorative purposes, we calculatedbivariate correlations between neuropsychological outcome vari-able and childhood trauma (CTQ sum score) measures anddepressive symptoms (BDI score).Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software(SPSS 22.0, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A p-value smaller than .05was considered to indicate statistical significance.ResultsSample characteristicsDemographic and clinical data are shown in Table 1 . The groupsdid not differ in age, years of education, smoking, and intake oforal contraceptives. None of the healthy participants (MDD - /ACE -, MDD - / ACE +) took any psychotropic medication,whereas several patients with MDD (MDD + / ACE +; MDD + /ACE -) received antidepressant medication (see also Table 1 ).However, the MDD patients with ACE did not differ in currentmedication intake from MDD patients without ACE (MDD + /ACE + 37% with antidepressant medication; MDD + / ACE -,44% with antidepressant medication), \u03c72=. 3 7 , d f=1 , p= .543.Following our inclusion and exclusion criteria, none of thecontrols (MDD - / ACE -) and none of the ACE group (MDD- / ACE +) met any mental disorder diagnoses as assessed withthe SCID interview. Of the MDD patients with ACE (MDD + /ACE +), eight patients met criteria for a comorbid anxiety disor-der, one patient met criteria for an obsessive-compulsive disorder,two patients met criteria for a somatic symptom disorder, and onepatient met criteria for borderline personality disorder. Of theMDD patients without ACE (MDD + / ACE -), 14 showed acomorbid anxiety disorder, four a somatic symptom disorderand one met criteria of borderline personality disorder or avoi-dant personality disorder.In accordance with our recruitment, MDD patients with ACE(MDD + / ACE +) and healthy participants with ACE (MDD - /ACE +) had significantly higher ETI and CTQ scores comparedwith the MDD patients without ACE (MDD + / ACE -) and theMDD - / ACE - group (ETI: F(3, 139) = 29.30, p< .001; CTQ:Development and Psychopathology 1009https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579419000932  Published online by Cambridge University PressF(3, 137) = 55.63, p< .001). MDD patients with and without ACE(MDD +/ ACE +, MDD + / ACE -) had higher depression scorescompared with the MDD - / ACE + group and the MDD - / ACE \u2013group, as expected (MADRS: F(3, 139) = 318.55, p< .001; BDI:F(3, 135) = 43.65, p< .001). For ETI and CTQ sum scores, posthoc tests (Bonferroni) revealed significantly higher scores in bothA C Eg r o u p s( M D D+ /A C E+ ,M D D-/A C E+ )c o m p a r e dw i t hpatients and participants without ACE (MDD +/ ACE -, MDD -/ ACE -), but no significant difference between both ACE groups(MDD +/ ACE +, MDD - / ACE +). More detailed informationis provided in (Wingenfeld et al., 2017).Stress responseFor area under the curve (AUC) values, separate 2 (Stress) x 4(Group) ANOVAs were computed for AUCi of cortisol andalpha-amylase levels. For AUCi of cortisol levels, a significantmain effect of Stress occurred, F(1, 139) = 37.4, p< .001, indicat-ing successful stress induction by the TSST compared with theP-TSST. Concerning alpha-amylase levels, we found no signifi-cant effects (see Table 2 ). Results of further biological and subjec-tive stress responses (saliva cortisol and alpha-amylase, bloodpressure, heart rate, subjective stress ratings) are presented indetail in (Wingenfeld et al., 2017 ).Table 1.

Kuehl et al.https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579419000932  Published online by Cambridge University PressNeuropsychological testing after TSST and Placebo-TSSTWe used mixed-models linear regression analysis to study therelationship between MDD, ACE, stress induction, and the per-formances in the different neuropsychological tests. For all testoutcomes, the basic model I with MDD, ACE, and Stress asfixed factors was the best fitting model according to the minimumAIC (seeTable 3 ). Increase of cortisol and alpha-amylase did notcontribute significantly to the model.Auditory verbal learning test (AVLT)For the AVLT, verbal learning, calculated by the recalled wordsfrom Trial 5, served as the dependent variable. As an additionaldependent variable, we calculated the percentage of delayedrecalled words based on the number of recalled words in thedelayed trial compared with those from Trial 5.Concerning verbal learning, MDD was a significant predictor(Trial 5: F(1, 143) = 5.16, p= .025; AIC= 967.46). That is, partic-ipants with MDD recalled fewer words than did participants with-out MDD (see also Figure 1a ). We found no influence ofmedication as a main effect, F(1, 80) = 0.01, p= .924, or via inter-action with ACE, F(1, 80) = 1.17, p= .283).Concerning delayed recall, the ACE x Stress interaction was a sig-nificant predictor ( F(1, 143) = 6.19, p= .014, AIC= 2436.66), indi-cating that participants with ACE were more likely to recall fewerwords in the delayed Trial 7 (as a percentage compared with Trial5) after stress (TSST) than after non-stress (P-TSST) conditionscompared with participants without ACE (see also Figure 1b ).We found no influence of medication as a main effect, F(1,80) = 1.63, p= .205) or via interaction with ACE ( F(1, 80) =2.18, p= .144).Trail-making test (TMT)For the TMT, the speed (in seconds) to complete part A, as ameasure of psychomotoric speed, and the difference score Bminus A, as a measure of executive function, served as dependentvariables.For part A, ACE was a significant predictor, F(1, 142) = 4.00,p= .048; AIC= 1973.83. That means participants with ACE weremore likely to complete part A more slowly than participantswithout ACE (see Figure 2a ). We found no influence of medica-tion as a main effect, F(1, 80) = 0.33, p= .569, or via interactionwith ACE (F (1, 80) = 2.38, p= .127).For the difference score B minus A, there was no significantresult ( AIC= 2741.46; see Figure 2b ). We found no influence ofmedication as a main effect, F(1, 80) = 0.03, p= .871, or via inter-action with ACE, F(1, 80) = 1.44, p= .234.Forward and backward digit spanHere, the number of correctly remembered digits of the digit spanforward and the digit span backward as measures of workingmemory served as dependent variables.For digit span forward, ACE was a significant predictor,F(1, 142.52) = 6.47, p= .012; AIC= 1210.33). That is, participantswith ACE were more likely to remember fewer digits comparedwith participants without ACE (see Figure 3a ).

We found noinfluence of medication as a main effect, F(1, 80) = 0.76, p= .385,or via interaction with ACE, F(1, 80) = 0.01, p= .915.Relationship between degree of MDD or ACE andneuropsychological measuresWe found a negative association between CTQ and AVLT delayedrecall after TSST, r=\u2212.17, p= .04, and a positive associationbetween CTQ sum and TMT A after TSST, r= .24, p= .004.After the TSST, there were negative associations between BDIand AVLT verbal learning, r=\u2212.22, p= .01, selective attention,r=\u2212.22, p= .02, and sustained attention, r=\u2212.19, p= .03.Furthermore, BDI correlated positively with TMT B-A afterTSST, r= .25, p= 005. In the P-TSST condition there was a posi-tive association between BDI and TMT B-A, r= .23, p= 008.These explorative results fit to our mixed-model analyses.DiscussionWith the current study, we intended to systematically investigatethe effects of an acute psychosocial stress induction on cognitiveperformance in individuals with MDD and ACE. MDD patientswith and without ACE and healthy participants with and withoutACE were included to disentangle potential effects of MDD andACE on the association between stress and cognitive performance.Overall, the diagnosis of MDD and the experience of childhoodadversity were significant predictors for a lower performance inspecific cognitive tasks. MDD could predict a lower performancein verbal learning (measured with the AVLT) and in selective andsustained attention (measured with the test d2), while ACE pre-dicted a lower performance in working memory (measured withthe digit span test) and psychomotoric speed (measured withpart A of the TMT).Deficits in learning and memory, attention, working memory,and psychomotoric speed have previously been demonstratedin MDD patients (Lee, Hermens, Porter, & Redoblado-Hodge,2012 ; Roca, Vives, Lopez-Navarro, Garcia-Campayo, & Gili,2015 ; Rock et al., 2014 ) and in individuals with ACE (Hedges&W o o n , 2011 ; Pechtel & Pizzagalli, 2011 ). However, potentialconfounding effects of MDD and ACE cannot be ruled out inmany studies. Because of the four-group design of the currentstudy, we could systematically investigate the effects of MDDand ACE. The results revealed only one of the factors, MDD orACE, as a significant predictor for different test outcomes,which might indicate that each factor influences distinctcognitive domains. Of course, these findings need further replica-tion. So far, only a few studies have investigated the effects ofMDD and ACE on cognitive performance systematically. Forexample, Saleh et al. ( 2017 ) investigated the effects of ACE ondepression, cognitive performance, and brain morphology indepressed patients and never-depressed individuals. In linewith our results, individuals with ACE \u2014or more specificallywith the subtypes emotional and sexual abuse and severe familyconflicts \u2014showed lower performance in processing speed andworking memory independently of an MDD diagnosis. Othercognitive domains were not affected. Furthermore, associationsof cognitive function and brain structure including smallervolumes of orbitofrontal cortex and decreased cortical thicknessin multiple areas were found in these individuals, which might atleast partly explain the results. In a recent review, Chen andBaram ( 2016 ) explain how ACE in the sense of early life stresscan influence the maturation of brain networks underlying cog-nitive functions such as hippocampal circuitry. As one importantmechanism, alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenalaxis are described. For MDD, accumulated research suggeststhat stress-associated alterations in inflammatory and glucocorti-coid signaling are associated with corresponding functionalchanges in multiple brain networks that might contribute tocognitive dysfunction (Otte et al., 2016 ). However, confoundingFigure 3. Mean numbers of correctly remembered digits of (a) digit span forward and (b) digit span backward as measures of working memory according to thefactors MDD and ACE as well as the stress conditions TSST and P-TSST. For digit span forward, ACE was a significant predictor. For digit span backward, M DD \u00d7Stress was a significant predictor. Error bars indicate standard errors. MDD, major depressive disorder.

Indeed, the Stress condition (TSST vs. P-TSST) pre-dicted cognitive performance only in interaction. In depressedpatients, stress predicted the lowest performance of workingmemory and selective attention (measured with the digit spanand d2 test). In individuals with ACE, only verbal memory (mea-sured with the AVLT) was affected by stress. Our results mightindicate that patients with MDD or individuals with ACE weremore susceptible to the negative effects of acute psychosocialstress, which could reflect alterations in signaling pathways orbrain networks as mentioned above. Of note, the cortisol stressresponse to the TSST was rather blunted in the MDD and ACEgroups compared with healthy controls, which is in line with pre-vious research (Bunea, Szentagotai-Tatar, & Miu, 2017 ; Zornet al., 2017 ). Still, we found an increase of cortisol across groupsafter the TSST, thereby validating the experimental stress manip-ulation (for detailed results of biological and subjective responsesto the TSST and P-TSST, please see Wingenfeld et al. ( 2017 ).However, the statistical models that included measures of cortisoland alpha-amylase increase did not provide additionalinformational value. In previous studies using exogenous cortisoladministration, we did not find effects in healthy participants(Deuter, Wingenfeld, Schultebraucks, Otte, & Kuehl, 2019 )o rMDD patients (Schlosser et al., 2010 ; Schlosser et al., 2013 ;Terfehr et al., 2011a ,2011b ). In individuals with ACE, suchstudies are missing. However, we have investigated patients withPTSD caused by childhood trauma and found improved memoryperformance after hydrocortisone administration (Wingenfeldet al., 2012 ). Of course, psychosocial stress induction differs mark-edly from exogenous cortisol administration and has been shownto affect cognitive processes differently (Shields et al., 2016 ). Thus,other than stress-associated cortisol, related biological processessuch as further hormone and immune system factors or psycho-logical processes such as rumination might have played an impor-tant role as well in our study. Future studies should furtherinvestigate which factors mediate stress induced effects on cogni-tion in patients with MDD and individuals with ACE.While there is a lack of studies investigating the effects of acutepsychosocial stress on cognitive performance in MDD patientsand traumatized individuals, several studies have investigatedthis topic in healthy participants. For the cognitive domains ofworking memory, attention and delayed verbal recall, some stud-ies show impairments in healthy participants after the TSST(Jiang & Rau, 2017 ; Luethi et al., 2008 ; Olver et al., 2015 ;Schoofs et al., 2008 ), while other studies found no effects ofacute psychosocial stress (Hidalgo et al., 2012 ; Luettgau,Schlagenhauf, & Sjoerds, 2018 ; Vrshek-Schallhorn, Velkoff, &Zinbarg, 2018 ), at least not in younger (Hidalgo, Almela,Villada, & Salvador, 2014 ) or female subsamples (Espin et al.,2013 ; Wolf, Schommer, Hellhammer, McEwen, & Kirschbaum,2001 ). The latter findings are in line with our results, whichshowed no main effect of the stress intervention. Such heteroge-neous findings might be due to differences in the paradigms orin the study protocols. In addition, gender differences mightplay a role. Especially for effects of the TSST on cognitive perfor-mance, several studies explicitly emphasize the importance ofgender (Cornelisse, van Stegeren, & Joels, 2011 ; Dos Santos,Leyendecker, Costa, & de Souza-Talarico, 2018 ; Espin et al.,2013 ; Schoofs, Pabst, Brand, & Wolf, 2013 ; Zandara et al.,2016 ). Our sample was restricted to females, thus it is unclearwhether our results are applicable to men. This seems particularlyimportant in the light of studies showing differences of acutestress effects on cognitive performance between men andwomen. As order of task was not randomized, we could notrule out that rising tiredness or reduced attention might haveinfluenced our results. Furthermore, we only measured cortisolFigure 4. Mean numbers of (a) correctly identified items of the d2 test (measure of selective attention, and of (b) the difference score of correctly minus wrong lyidentified items (measure of sustained attention according to the factors MDD and ACE as well as the stress conditions TSST and P-TSST. For selective a ttention,MDD and MDD \u00d7 Stress were significant predictors. For sustained attention, MDD was a significant predictor and MDD \u00d7 Stress almost a significant predi ctor.

It is possible that taking antidepressant medica-tion has an influence on the cognitive measures we assessed.Accordingly, we took care to ensure that the proportion of med-icated patients in the groups with/without ACE was not different.In order to check the influence of medication, additional post hocanalyses were calculated. There were no differences betweenpatients with or without medication in all dependent measures,both for the main effects Medication and in the interactionsMedication x ACE.Besides these limitations, our study had several strengths. Weused a stress task as well as a control condition to investigatethe endocrine stress response and effects on cognitive perfor-mance in ACE and MDD. Additionally, the presence of any men-tal disorder was an exclusion criterion in the ACE group, which isa major strength of the study because it allowed us to systemati-cally differentiate between the factors MDD and ACE.ConclusionsWith the current study, we investigated the differential effects of apsychosocial stress induction on cognitive performance by usingestablished neuropsychological tests in a four-group factorialdesign in which the factors MDD and ACE were fully crossed.In sum, our results indicate a negative effect of MDD and ACEon distinct cognitive domains. Thereby, our results underlinethe importance of systematically studying the effects of MDDand ACE on cognitive impairments to understand underlyingmechanisms. Furthermore, the presence of MDD and/or ACEseemed to enhance susceptibility for stress-related impairmentsof cognitive performance. Future studies should further investi-gate which factors mediate such stress-induced effects on cogni-tion and should additionally include male participants toinvestigate potential gender differences.Acknowledgements.
