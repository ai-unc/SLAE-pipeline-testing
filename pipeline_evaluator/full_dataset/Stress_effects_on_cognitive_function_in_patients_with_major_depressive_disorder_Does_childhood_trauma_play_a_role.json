Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) enhance the risk for MDD and can contribute to disturbances in the stress systems,\nincluding cortisol and cognitive functions. In healthy participants, cortisol administration as well as acute stress can affect cognitive per-\nformance. In the current study, we tested cognitive performance in MDD patients with (N= 32) and without (N=52) ACE and healthy\nparticipants with (N= 22) and without (N= 37) ACE after psychosocial stress induction (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) and a control con-\ndition (Placebo-TSST). MDD predicted lower performance in verbal learning and both selective and sustained attention, while ACE pre-\ndicted lower performance in psychomotoric speed and working memory. There were no interaction effects of MDD and ACE. After stress,\nMDD patients were more likely to show lower performance in working memory as well as in selective and sustained attention compared\nwith participants without MDD. Individuals with ACE were more likely to show lower performance in verbal memory after stress compared\nwith individuals without ACE. Our results indicate negative effects of MDD and ACE on distinct cognitive domains. Furthermore, MDD\nand/or ACE seem to enhance susceptibility for stress-related cognitive impairments.\n\nKeywords: adverse childhood experiences, attention, major depressive disorder, memory, trier social stress test\n\n(Received 31 October 2018; revised 17 March 2019; accepted 11 May 2019)\n\nIntroduction (Calfa et al, 2003; Holsboer, 2000; Pariante & Lightman, 2008;\nParker, Schatzberg, & Lyons, 2003; Waters et al, 2015; Webster,\nKnable, O\u2019Grady, Orthmann, & Weickert, 2002).\n\nIn accordance with the hypothesis of reduced GR sensitivity in\nMDD patients, previous studies from our group demonstrated\nthat acute cortisol administration took effect on cognitive perfor-\nmance, with lower performance in working memory and retrieval\nand better performance in response inhibition in healthy control\nparticipants but not in MDD patients (Schlosser et al., 2010;\nSchlosser et al, 2013; Terfehr et al, 2011a, 2011b). To some\nextent, these pharmacological manipulations also mimic parts of\nthe biological stress response.\n\nHowever, a whole stress response is a complex interplay of\nrelated hormone and immune system factors. This explains why\ndivergent effects of stress induction versus cortisol administration\non cognitive performance (e.g, executive functions) were also\nfound in previous studies (Shields, Sazma, & Yonelinas, 2016).\nSince stress-related factors such as socioenvironmental events\nplay an important role for the risk and outcome of MDD (Otte\n\nAuthor for Correspondence: Linn K. Kuehl, PhD, Department of Peychiatry and \u20act la 2016), it is of importance to understand the effects of\nPsychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 - Universititsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, acute stress on cognitive performance in these patients. Several\nHindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany, Phone: +49 30 450 517625, Email: linn. studies investigated the effects of acute psychosocial stress on cog-\nkuehl@charite de ~ _ nitive performance in healthy participants (Domes, Heinrichs,\nCle de Lo Dor 5 95 OC Reichl, Havtingr, 2005 Tang & Rat, 2017; Luh,\nsive disorder: Does childhood trauma play a role? Development and Psychopathology 32, Meier, & Sandi, 2008; Olver, Pinney, Maruff, & Norman, 2015;\n1007-1016. https://doi.org/10.1017/50954579419000932 Schoofs, Preuss, & Wolf, 2008). The results of these studies vary\n\nCognitive dysfunction is a highly relevant symptom dimension of\n\u2018major depressive disorder (MDD) (Millan et al, 2012) because it\nseverely compromises quality of life and complicates remission.\nCognitive domains that are predominantly affected include mem-\nory, executive function, and attention (Rock, Roiser, Riedel, &\nBlackwell, 2014).\n\nInterestingly, evidence has been accumulated that cognitive\nsymptoms of MDD, especially impairments in memory and execu-\ntive function, might be associated with elevated cortisol levels\n(Behnken et al, 2013; Gomez et al, 2006; Hinkelmann et al,\n2009, 2013; O'Hara et al, 2007; Schlosser et al, 2011).\nMaladaptive changes in the stress systems have been found fre-\nquently in MDD patients, including alterations of the hypothalamus\npituitary adrenal (HPA) axis with higher basal cortisol release and\nreduced feedback sensitivity. Reduced glucocorticoid receptor\n(GR) functions have been suggested as an underlying mechanism\n\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2019\n\n\n1008\n\nbetween different cognitive domains and show impairing effects\nof acute psychosocial stress on working memory (Jiang & Rau,\n2017; Luethi, et al, 2008; Olver, et al, 2015; Schoofs, et al,\n2008) and attention (Olver, et al, 2015), improvement of spatial\nmemory (Luethi, et al, 2008) and mixed results for verbal mem-\nory (Domes, et al., 2002; Luethi, et al,, 2008; Olver, et al, 2015).\n\nComparable studies are missing in MDD patients. However,\nsince important changes in the stress systems have been found\nin these patients, an acute stress induction, such as psychosocial\nstress, might have different effects on MDD patients than on\nhealthy control participants as well.\n\nOne important factor that might contribute to maladaptive\nchanges in the stress systems is severe early stress experiences,\nor adverse childhood experiences (ACE) such as physical or sex-\nual abuse. Such experiences increase the risk for MDD, but might\nalso have persistent effects on the stress systems (Otte et al, 2016).\nFurthermore, ACE have been associated with diminished cogni-\ntive performance later in life (Hedges & Woon, 2011; Lovallo\net al, 2013; Pechtel & Pizzagalli, 2011; Pesonen et al, 2013).\nTherefore, it seems of great importance to take the potential\nrole of ACE into account when associations of stress and cognitive\nfunctions are investigated in MDD patients.\n\nWith the current study, we intended to systematically investi-\ngate the effect of a psychosocial stress induction on cognitive per-\nformance in different cognitive domains in individuals with MDD\nand ACE. To disentangle potential effects of MDD and ACE,\nMDD patients with and without ACE and healthy participants\nwith and without ACE were included using a full factorial design\nwith the factors MDD and ACE as predictors for cognitive perfor-\n\u2018mance after stress. For psychosocial stress induction, we chose the\nTrier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum, Pirke, &\nHellhammer, 1993) to administer to experimental groups to com-\npare their cognitive performance with participants in a\nPlacebo-TSST group. We expected the largest effects of the stress\nintervention on cognitive performance for the combination of\nMDD and ACE factors.\n\nMethods and material\nParticipants\n\nTo investigate the potential effects of MDD and ACE, we recruited\nwomen with MDD and ACE (MDD +/ ACE +; N=32); with\nMDD but without ACE (MDD +/ ACE -; N=52); with ACE\nbut no current or lifetime MDD (MDD - / ACE +; N=22); and\nwomen who had never had any mental disorder and did not\nreport sexual or physical abuse (MDD - / ACE -; N=37). ACE\nwas defined as repeated sexual or physical abuse at least once a\nmonth over a period of one year or more (Heim, Ehlert, &\nHellhammer, 2000) before the age of 18 years.\n\nOn the first study day, all participants underwent a comprehen-\nsive clinical assessment. This assessment included the Structured\nClinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I and II to validate psychiatric\ndiagnoses and a semistructured interview, the Early Trauma\nInventory (ETL; Bremner, Vermetten, & Mazure, 2000; Wingenfeld\net al, 2011) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ;\nBernstein et al, 2003; Wingenfeld et al, 2010) to assess ACE.\n\nAll patients of the MDD groups met the diagnostic criteria for\ncurrent major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV, assessed\nby SCID-I (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I di\norders). Exclusion criteria for the MDD groups were bipolar dis-\norder, depressive disorder with psychotic features, schizophrenia,\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50954579419000932 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nLinn K. Kuehl et al.\n\nschizoaffective disorder, anorexia, and alcohol or drug depen-\ndence. Current depressive symptoms were assessed by a clinical\ninterview, the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale\n(MADRS; Montgomery & Asberg, 1979 Williams & Kobak,\n2008), and a self-rating questionnaire (Beck Depression\nInventory (BDL Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996). Healthy participants\nwith and without ACE were free of any current mental disorder.\n\nAdditional exclusion criteria for all participants were severe\nsomatic diseases, CNS or autoimmune diseases, metabolic or\nendocrine diseases, current infections, pregnancy, or a body\n\u2018mass index (BMI) above 30.\n\nParticipants were recruited from our affective disorder clinics\nand by public posting. Healthy controls were recruited via\n(online) advertisement.\n\nAll participants provided written informed consent. Healthy\ncontrol participants and outpatients received monetary compen-\nsation (\u20ac200) for their participation. The study was approved by\nthe local ethical committee.\n\nProcedures\n\nThe study protocol included two experimental sessions beginning\nat 5 p.m. At baseline, salivary samples for analyses of cortisol and\nalpha-amylase were collected (Salivettes\u00ae, blue cap; Sarstedt,\nGermany) and blood pressure as well as heart rate were measured\nwith an automatic blood pressure monitor for upper arm mea-\nsurement (Boso Medicus Uno, Bosch + Sohn GmbH u. Co KG)\nat 0 and +15 minutes. In quasi-randomized order, a psychosocial\nstress test (TSST) or a control task (P-TSST) was conducted on\nthe first or the second day, respectively. Afterwards, two post-\nstress salivary samples (+30 and +40 minutes) were collected\nand blood pressure as well as heart rate were measured. Thirty\nminutes after the TSST or P-TSST, neuropsychological testing\ntook place and saliva samples were collected before and after neu-\nropsychological testing (+60 and +75 minutes). Blood pressure\nand heart rate were measured as well. During the break between\nTSST and neuropsychological testing, participants were invited\nto consume food from a standardized buffet as a separate part\nof this study, with results reported elsewhere (Wingenfeld et al.,\n2017). There was no difference in the number of consumed calo-\nties between groups or between TSST and P-TSST conditions.\nApart from the buffet, participants were instructed not to eat\nafter 1 p.m.\n\nStress induction\n\n\u2018We used the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) as a standardized psy-\nchosocial stress test and the Placebo-TSST (P-TSST) as the con-\ntrol condition (Het, Rohleder, Schoofs, Kirschbaum, & Wolf,\n2009). The TSST reliably induces activation of the HPA axis\nand consists of three phases: preparation, a speech in front of a\ntrained audience, and an arithmetic task (5 minutes each). The\nP-TSST is designed to be as similar as possible to the TSST with-\nout being stressful to the participant. In an empty room, the par-\nticipant is asked to talk aloud about a topic of his/her choice after\na preparation phase and to do an easy arithmetic task afterwards.\n\u2018We have described the TSST procedure and important outcome\nvariables in more detail in Wingenfeld et al. (2017).\n\nNeuropsychological testing\n\nNeuropsychological tests were conducted 30 minutes after the\nTSST or Placebo-TSST and comprised the Auditory Verbal\n\n\nDevelopment and Psychopathology\n\nLearning Test, the Trail Making Test A and B (TMT-A, TMT-B),\nthe letter cancellation test (d2), and the Digit Span Test. All neu-\nropsychological tests were administered by trained psychologists.\n\nAuditory verbal learning test (AVLT; Lezak, Howieson, Loring,\nHannay, & Fischer, 1995)\n\nThe AVLT measures short- and long-term verbal memory. For\nfive times, the experimenter reads a list of 15 words (list A),\nwhich the participant is requested to repeat in loose order (verbal\nlearning). Then, the participant is asked to reproduce words from\na newly presented list (list B) as a distractor. Following this, the\nparticipant is asked to recall the words from list A without\nrenewed presentation (immediate recall). After 30 min, the partic-\nipant is instructed to repeat the words from list A again without\nrenewed presentation (delayed recall). Outcome measures were\nthe amount of recalled words of Trial 5 (measure of verbal learn-\ning) and the percentage of recalled words based on the number of\nrecalled words in the delayed trial (delayed recall after 30 min)\ncompared with Trial 5.\n\nTrail-making test (TMT; Reitan, 1992)\n\n\u2018With the TMT part A, psychomotoric speed is assessed. In this\ntask, the participant has to connect encircled numbers in ascend-\ning order as quickly as possible. With part B, executive function is\nalso assessed. This test requires the alternation between numbers\nand letters in ascending order. The score of each part is repre-\nsented by the time needed to complete the task. Additionally,\nthe difference score (B minus A) reflects switch costs, a relatively\npure indicator of executive function (Sanchez-Cubillo et al,\n2009).\n\nForward and backward digit span (Tewes, 1991)\n\nThis test is part of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS).\nDuring the forward digit span task, participants are asked to\nremember a series of digits and to repeat them in the same\norder. During the backward digit span task, participants are\nasked to repeat the digits in reverse order. The number of cor-\nrectly remembered digits is a measure of working memory.\n\nTest d2 (Brickenkamp, 1978)\n\nThe Test d2 is a letter cancellation test that measures selective and\nsustained attention. On a paper with rows of target and distractor\nstimuli, the participant is instructed to cross out the letter \u201cd\u201d\nwhenever it is accompanied by two small lines; d's with more\nor less than two lines or any stimuli containing the character\n\u201cp\u201d serve as distracters. After a practice trial, there are 14 rows\nwith target and distracter stimuli. The number of correctly iden-\ntified items serves as an indicator of selective attention, the differ-\nence of correctly identified items minus wrongly identified items\nis a measure of sustained attention.\n\nData analysis\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed with\nANOVA for continuous variables or a chi-squared test for dichot-\nomous variables.\n\n\u2018We analyzed whether the TSST evoked an increased stress\nresponse compared with the P-TSST. For cortisol and\nalpha-amylase, we additionally computed the area under the\ncurve with respect to increase (AUCI) (Pruessner, Kirschbaum,\nMeinlschmid, & Hellhammer, 2003). Because both variables\nwere not normally distributed, we log-transformed raw values\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50954579419000932 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1009\n\nand conducted 2 x 4 repeated measures ANOVAs with the factors\nStress (TSST vs. P-TSST) and Group (MDD-/ ACE-; MDD-/ ACE\n+; MDD+/ ACE-; MDD+/ ACE+) for statistical analyses. The two\nAUCi variables served also as predictors in the models described\nbelow. Further analyses of biological and subjective stress\nresponses are presented in detail in Wingenfeld et al. (2017).\n\nWe used mixed-model linear regression analyses (unstructured\ncovariance type, maximum likelihood method) to analyze the\ninfluence of the factors MDD and ACE on neuropsychological\nperformance after the stress (TSST) and non-stress (P-TSST)\ninduction conditions. The outcome measure of each neuro-\npsychological test served as the dependent variable. For the\ncomputations, MDD, ACE, and Stress (repeated factor) were\ndefined as fixed factors in model I. To control for cortisol and\nalpha-amylase response, we included the AUCI of cortisol\nand alpha-amylase as covariates in addition to the fixed\nfactors MDD and ACE in model II. Akaike\u2019s Information\nCriterion (AIC) was used to assess model fit for each outcome\nvariable.\n\nIn a follow-up analysis, we investigated whether antidepressant\nmedication had an effect on cognitive performance in our study.\nWithin the depressive participants, we calculated a 2 x 2 ANOVA\nfor cach dependent variable with the factors ACE (yes/no) x\nMedication (yes/no). For explorative purposes, we calculated\nbivariate correlations between neuropsychological outcome vari-\nable and childhood trauma (CTQ sum score) measures and\ndepressive symptoms (BDI score).\n\nData analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software\n(SPSS 22.0, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A p-value smaller than .05\nwas considered to indicate statistical significance.\n\nResults\nSample characteristics\n\nDemographic and clinical data are shown in Table 1. The groups\ndid not differ in age, years of education, smoking, and intake of\noral contraceptives. None of the healthy participants (MDD - /\nACE -, MDD - / ACE +) took any psychotropic medication,\nwhereas several patients with MDD (MDD +/ ACE +; MDD +/\nACE -) received antidepressant medication (see also Table 1).\nHowever, the MDD patients with ACE did not differ in current\nmedication intake from MDD patients without ACE (MDD +/\nACE +37% with antidepressant medication; MDD +/ ACE -,\n44% with antidepressant medication), y* = 37, df= 1, p=.543.\n\nFollowing our inclusion and exclusion criteria, none of the\ncontrols (MDD - / ACE -) and none of the ACE group (MDD\n- / ACE +) met any mental disorder diagnoses as assessed with\nthe SCID interview. Of the MDD patients with ACE (MDD +/\nACE +), eight patients met criteria for a comorbid anxiety disor-\nder, one patient met criteria for an obsessive-compulsive disorder,\ntwo patients met criteria for a somatic symptom disorder, and one\npatient met criteria for borderline personality disorder. Of the\nMDD patients without ACE (MDD +/ ACE -), 14 showed a\ncomorbid anxiety disorder, four a somatic symptom disorder\nand one met criteria of borderline personality disorder or avoi-\ndant personality disorder.\n\nIn accordance with our recruitment, MDD patients with ACE\n(MDD +/ ACE +) and healthy participants with ACE (MDD - /\nACE +) had significantly higher ETI and CTQ scores compared\nwith the MDD patients without ACE (MDD +/ ACE -) and the\nMDD - / ACE - group (ETL: F (3, 139) =29.30, p < .001; CTQ:\n\n\n1010\n\nLinn K.

MDD could predict a lower performance\nin verbal learning (measured with the AVLT) and in selective and\nsustained attention (measured with the test d2), while ACE pre-\ndicted a lower performance in working memory (measured with\nthe digit span test) and psychomotoric speed (measured with\n\nadversity were si\n\npart A of the TMT).\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50954579419000932 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nand a positive association\n\nAfter the TSST, there were negative associations between BDI\nand AVLT verbal learning, r=\u2014.22, p=.01, selective attention,\nr=-22, p=.02, and sustained attention, r=-.19, p=.03.\nFurthermore, BDI correlated positively with TMT B-A after\nTSST, r= 25, p= 005. In the P-TSST condition there was a posi-\ntive association between BDI and TMT B-A, r=.23, p=008.\n\nDeficits in learning and memory, attention, working memory,\nand psychomotoric speed have previously been demonstrated\nin MDD patients (Lee, Hermens, Porter, & Redoblado-Hodge,\n2012; Roca, Vives, Lopez-Navarro, Garcia-Campayo, & Gili,\n2015; Rock et al,, 2014) and in individuals with ACE (Hedges\n& Woon, 2011; Pechtel & Pizzagalli, 2011). However, potential\nconfounding effects of MDD and ACE cannot be ruled out in\nmany studies. Because of the four-group design of the current\nstudy, we could systematically investigate the effects of MDD\nand ACE. The results revealed only one of the factors, MDD or\nACE, as a significant predictor for different test outcomes,\nwhich might indicate that each factor influences distinct\ncognitive domains. Of course, these findings need further replica-\ntion. So far, only a few studies have investigated the effects of\nMDD and ACE on cognitive performance systematically. For\nexample, Saleh et al. (2017) investigated the effects of ACE on\ndepression, cognitive performance, and brain morphology in\ndepressed patients and never-depressed individuals. In line\nwith our results, individuals with ACE\u2014or more specifically\nwith the subtypes emotional and sexual abuse and severe family\nconflicts\u2014showed lower performance in processing speed and\nworking memory independently of an MDD diagnosis. Other\ncognitive domains were not affected. Furthermore, associations\nof cognitive function and brain structure including smaller\nvolumes of orbitofrontal cortex and decreased cortical thickness\nin multiple areas were found in these individuals, which might at\nleast partly explain the results. In a recent review, Chen and\nBaram (2016) explain how ACE in the sense of early life stress\ncan influence the maturation of brain networks underlying cog-\nnitive functions such as hippocampal circuitry. As one important\nmechanism, alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\naxis are described. For MDD, accumulated research suggests\nthat stress-associated alterations in inflammatory and glucocorti-\ncoid signaling are associated with corresponding functional\nchanges in multiple brain networks that might contribute to\ncognitive dysfunction (Otte et al., 2016). However, confounding\n\n\n1014 Linn K.

P-TSST, placebo-TSST.\n\neffects of MDD and ACE might play a role in some of these\nstudies as well.\n\nInterestingly, stress alone had no predictive value in the cur-\nrent study. Indeed, the Stress condition (TSST vs. P-TSST) pre-\ndicted cognitive performance only in interaction. In depressed\npatients, stress predicted the lowest performance of working\nmemory and selective attention (measured with the digit span\nand d2 test). In individuals with ACE, only verbal memory (mea-\nsured with the AVLT) was affected by stress. Our results might\nindicate that patients with MDD or individuals with ACE were\nmore susceptible to the negative effects of acute psychosocial\nstress, which could reflect alterations in signaling pathways or\nbrain networks as mentioned above. Of note, the cortisol stress\nresponse to the TSST was rather blunted in the MDD and ACE\ngroups compared with healthy controls, which is in line with pre-\nvious research (Bunea, Szentagotai-Tatar, & Miu, 2017; Zorn\net al, 2017). Still, we found an increase of cortisol across groups\nafter the TSST, thereby validating the experimental stress manip-\nulation (for detailed results of biological and subjective responses\nto the TSST and P-TSST, please see Wingenfeld et al. (2017).\nHowever, the statistical models that included measures of cortisol\nand alpha-amylase increase did not provide additional\ninformational value. In previous studies using exogenous cortisol\nadministration, we did not find effects in healthy participants\n(Deuter, Wingenfeld, Schultebraucks, Otte, & Kuehl, 2019) or\nMDD patients (Schlosser et al, 2010; Schlosser et al, 2013;\nTerfehr et al, 2011a, 2011b). In individuals with ACE, such\nstudies are missing. However, we have investigated patients with\nPTSD caused by childhood trauma and found improved memory\nperformance after hydrocortisone administration (Wingenfeld\netal, 2012). Of course, psychosocial stress induction differs mark-\nedly from exogenous cortisol administration and has been shown\nto affect cognitive processes differently (Shields et al., 2016). Thus,\nother than stress-associated cortisol, related biological processes\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50954579419000932 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nsuch as further hormone and immune system factors or psycho-\nlogical processes such as rumination might have played an impor-\ntant role as well in our study. Future studies should further\ninvestigate which factors mediate stress induced effects on cogni-\ntion in patients with MDD and individuals with ACE.\n\n\u2018While there is a lack of studies investigating the effects of acute\npsychosocial stress on cognitive performance in MDD patients\nand traumatized individuals, several studies have investigated\nthis topic in healthy participants. For the cognitive domains of\nworking memory, attention and delayed verbal recall, some stud-\nies show impairments in healthy participants after the TSST\n(Jiang & Rau, 2017; Luethi et al, 2008; Olver et al, 2015;\nSchoofs et al,, 2008), while other studies found no effects of\nacute psychosocial stress (Hidalgo et al, 2012; Luettgau,\nSchlagenhauf, & Sjoerds, 2018; Vrshek-Schallhorn, Velkoff, &\nZinbarg, 2018), at least not in younger (Hidalgo, Almela,\nVillada, & Salvador, 2014) or female subsamples (Espin et al,\n2013; Wolf, Schommer, Hellhammer, McEwen, & Kirschbaum,\n2001). The latter findings are in line with our results, which\nshowed no main effect of the stress intervention. Such heteroge-\nneous findings might be due to differences in the paradigms or\nin the study protocols. In addition, gender differences might\nplay a role. Especially for effects of the TSST on cognitive perfor-\nmance, several studies explicitly emphasize the importance of\ngender (Cornelisse, van Stegeren, & Joels, 2011; Dos Santos,\nLeyendecker, Costa, & de Souza-Talarico, 2018; Espin et al,\n2013; Schoofs, Pabst, Brand, & Wolf, 2013; Zandara et al,\n2016). Our sample was restricted to female, thus it is unclear\n\nThis seems particularly\nimportant in the light of studies showing differences of acute\nstress effects on cognitive performance between men and\nwomen. As order of task was not randomized, we could not\nrule out that rising tiredness or reduced attention might have\ninfluenced our results. Furthermore, we only measured cortisol\n\n\nDevelopment and Psychopathology\n\nand alpha-amylase, but not ACTH release or other factors in\nresponse to stress which limits our interpretations of the stress\n\nAccordingly, we took care to ensure that the proportion of med-\nicated patients in the groups with/without ACE was not different.\nIn order to check the influence of medication, additional post hoc\nanalyses were calculated. There were no differences between\npatients with or without medication in all dependent measures,\nboth for the main effects Medication and in the interactions\nMedication x ACE.\n\nBesides these limitations, our study had several strengths. We\nused a stress task as well as a control condition to investigate\nthe endocrine stress response and effects on cognitive perfor-\n\u2018mance in ACE and MDD. Additionally, the presence of any men-\ntal disorder was an exclusion criterion in the ACE group, which is\na major strength of the study because it allowed us to systemati-\ncally differentiate between the factors MDD and ACE.\n\nConclusions\n\n\u2018With the current study, we investigated the differential effects of a\npsychosocial stress induction on cognitive performance by using\nestablished neuropsychological tests in a four-group factorial\ndesign in which the factors MDD and ACE were fully crossed.\nIn sum, our results indicate a negative effect of MDD and ACE\non distinct cognitive domains. Thereby, our results underline\nthe importance of systematically studying the effects of MDD\nand ACE on cognitive impairments to understand underlying\nmechanisms. Furthermore, the presence of MDD and/or ACE\nseemed to enhance susceptibility for stress-related impairments\nof cognitive performance. Future studies should further investi-\ngate which factors mediate such stress-induced effects on cogni-\ntion and should additionally include male participants to\ninvestigate potential gender differences.\n\nAcknowledgements.
