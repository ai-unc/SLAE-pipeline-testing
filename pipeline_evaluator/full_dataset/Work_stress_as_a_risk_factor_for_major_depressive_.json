Major depression is a prevalent mental disorder in the general population, with amulti-factorial etiology. However, work stress as a risk factor for major depression has not beenwell studied.Method. Using a longitudinal study design, this analysis investigated the association between thelevels of work stress and major depressive episode(s) in the Canadian working population, aged 18to 64 years. Data from the longitudinal cohort of the Canadian National Population Health Survey(NPHS) were used ( n=6663). The NPHS participants who did not have major depressive episodes(MDE) at baseline (1994\u20131995 NPHS) were classi\ufb01ed into four groups by the quartile values of thebaseline work stress scores. The proportion of MDE of each group was calculated using the1996\u20131997 NPHS data.Results. The \ufb01rst three quartile groups had a similar risk of MDE. Those who had a work stressscore above the 75th percentile had an elevated risk of MDE (7.1%). Using the 75th percentile as acut-o\ufb00, work stress was signi\ufb01cantly associated with the risk of MDE in multivariate analysis (oddsratio=2.35, 95% con\ufb01dence interval 1.54\u20133.77). Other factors associated with MDE in multi-variate analysis included educational level, number of chronic medical illnesses and child andadulthood traumatic events. There was no evidence of e\ufb00ect modi\ufb01cation between work stress andselected sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial variables.Conclusions. Work stress is an independent risk factor for the development of MDE in the workingpopulation. Strategies to improve working environment are needed to keep workers mentallyhealthy and productive.INTRODUCTIONMajor depression is one of the most prevalentmental disorders and has a multi-factorialetiology. In addition to genetic factors, child-hood traumatic events and recent stressful lifeevents have been found to be strong risk factorsfor major depression (Kendler et al. 2002). Inthe workplace, however, one important riskfactor for depressive disorders may be workstress. The demand\u2013control model posits thatthe situations in which one\u2019s control over one\u2019swork is low and the psychological demandsimposed by one\u2019s work are high may lead thenegative outcomes, such as fatigue and de-pression (Karasek & Theorell, 1990). Previousstudies indicate that work stress increases therisk of physical illnesses (Theorell et al. 1998;Melamed et al. 1999; Myers et al. 1999) and ofpsychological distress (Matthews et al. 2001;Bultmann et al. 2002) and is associated withthe level of depressive symptoms (Iwata et al.1988; Stansfeld et al . 1997, 1999). However,work stress as a potential risk factor for majordepressive episodes (MDE) has not beenexamined.* Address for correspondence: Dr JianLi Wang, Department ofPsychiatry, Peter Lougheed Centre, Room 3645, 3500-26 Ave NE,Calgary, Alberta, Canada, T1Y 6J4.(Email: jianli.wang@calgaryhealthregion.ca)Psychological Medicine , 2005, 35, 865\u2013871. f2004 Cambridge University Pressdoi:10.1017/S0033291704003241 Printed in the United Kingdom865https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291704003241  Published online by Cambridge University PressIn occupational health research, work stresshas been commonly measured by the Job Con-tent Questionnaire (JCQ; Karasek et al. 1998)or by its modi\ufb01ed versions based upon thedemand\u2013control model. The JCQ assesses workstress in six dimensions: skill discretion, decisionauthority, psychological demand, job insecurity,physical exertion and support from supervisoror co-workers. Cross-sectional studies using thedata from the Epidemiological Catchment Areastudy (Mausner-Dorsch & Eaton, 2000) andfrom the Canadian National Population HealthSurvey (NPHS; Wang & Patten, 2001) reportedthat certain dimensions of work stress wereassociated with MDE. A longitudinal study usingthe NPHS data found that MDE was associatedwith high levels of work stress in skill discretion,psychological demand, job insecurity and sup-port from supervisors or co-workers as measuredby the abbreviated version of the JCQ (Wang,2004a). Identifying speci\ufb01c job characteristicsassociated with poor mental health may assist inre-designing organizational structure to improveworkers\u2019 productivity. However, the work stressdimensions are likely to be correlated to eachother. Thus, investigating the relationshipbetween overall work stress and depression willimprove our understanding about the etiologyof depressive disorders. Additionally, the medianvalue of work stress has been used as a cut-o\ufb00point for de\ufb01ning high and low levels of workstress in the literature (Achat et al . 2000;Mausner-Dorsch & Eaton, 2000; Rosvall et al.2002; Eaker et al. 2004). The justi\ufb01cations forsuch a classi\ufb01cation schema were not su\ufb03cient.Investigating the relationship between overallwork stress and MDE from a longitudinal per-spective may shed light on this importantmethodological issue.Using the data from the longitudinal cohortof the NPHS, the objectives of this analysis wereto:(1) investigate the relationship between thelevels of work stress and later occurrence ofMDE, and(2) examine if work stress interacts withbaseline sociodemographic, clinical and psycho-social factors to increase the risk of MDE.It was hypothesized that individuals who wereat a high level of work stress were more likely tohave had MDE and that work stress did notinteract with baseline sociodemographic, clinicaland psychosocial factors to increase the riskof MDE.MATERIALS AND METHODPopulation and designThe NPHS initiated in 1994\u20131995 is a nationalhealth survey using strati\ufb01ed two-stage randomsampling procedures (Statistics Canada, 1996).The target population consisted of householdresidents in all Canadian provinces, excludingthose living on Indian Reserves, CanadianForces bases, in long-term institutions and incertain remote areas in Quebec and Ontario(Statistics Canada, 1996). Within provinces thesample was distributed proportionally to thepopulation size. In the \ufb01rst stage of sampling,homogeneous strata based upon geographicand/or socio-economic status were formed andindependent samples of clusters (usually CensusEnumeration Areas) were drawn from eachstratum. In the second stage, dwelling lists wereprepared for each cluster and dwellings orhouseholds were selected from the lists. Theparticipants in the 1994\u20131995 NPHS formed alongitudinal cohort which was re-interviewedevery 2 years. The baseline NPHS interviewswere conducted face-to-face by interviewerstrained by Statistics Canada. Telephone inter-viewing was the major data collection methodin subsequent surveys (Swain et al. 1999). Aftera complete description of the study to the sub-jects, written informed consent was obtained.The longitudinal response rate for the 1995\u20131996 NPHS was 93.6% (Swain et al. 1999). Forthis analysis, data from the 1994\u20131995 NPHS(baseline) and the 1996\u20131997 NPHS were used.In the baseline survey, 17 276 participants wereinterviewed. Among these, 6633 were agedbetween 18 and 64 years, were employed at thetime of the interviews, provided complete in-formation about work stress and had not hadMDE in the 12 months prior to the interviews.These subjects were included in this analysis.MDEMDE in the past 12 months was evaluated inthe NPHS using the Composite InternationalDiagnostic Interview \u2013 Short Form for MajorDepression (CIDI-SFMD) which was derivedfrom the World Health Organization\u2019s Com-posite International Diagnostic Interview. The866 J. Wanghttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291704003241  Published online by Cambridge University PressCIDI-SFMD was developed and validatedagainst the full version of CIDI (Kessler et al.1998). A probability of 0.9 based on the CIDI-SFMD was de\ufb01ned the \u2018caseness\u2019 of MDE,based upon the criteria of DSM-III-R (APA,1987). This cut-point corresponds to reporting 5out of 8 depressive symptoms outlined in theDSM, at least one of which must be depressedmood or loss of interest. This choice of a cut-point can be justi\ufb01ed by its face validity for theDSM-IV criteria (APA, 1994).Work stressThe NPHS used a brief version (12 items) of theJCQ (Karasek et al . 1998) to measure workstress in six dimensions. The 12 questions usedin the NPHS are as follows.Skill discretion(1) Your job required that you learn new things.(2) Your job required a high level of skill.(3) Your job required that you do things overand over.Decision authority(4) Your job allowed you freedom to decide howyou did your job.(5) You had a lot to say about what happened inyour job.Psychological demands(6) Your job was very hectic.(7) You were free from con\ufb02icting demands thatothers made.Job insecurity(8) Your job security was good.Physical exertion(9) Your job required a lot of physical e\ufb00ort.Social support from co-workers and supervisors(10) You were exposed to hostility or con\ufb02ictfrom the people you worked with.(11) Your supervisor was helpful in getting thejob done.(12) The people you work with were helpful ingetting the job done.The answer to each question was based upona 5-point scale (0 =strongly agree, 1 =agree,2=neither agree nor disagree, 3 =disagree,4=strongly disagree). The scores were reversedfor items 3, 6, 9 and 10. The total score of theJCQ was 48, with a high score indicating ahigher level of work stress. In the 1994\u20131995NPHS, the abbreviated version of the JCQhad a moderate internal consistency ( a=0.48).However, the moderate internal consistencydoes not necessarily mean that the abbreviatedversion of the JCQ was insensitive. According toMcDowell & Newell (1996), an internal con-sistency is related to the number of items of themeasurement, that a moderate internal consist-ency may indicate that there is no redundancy inthe measurement and that each item adds newinformation to the measure. If an instrumentcovers several dimensions (in the JCQ, sixdimensions of work stress are assessed), it isreasonable to expect a moderate internal con-sistency (Boyle, 1985). All eligible participantsprovided information about work stress.Sociodemographic variablesSociodemographic variables included in thisanalysis are: gender, age, marital status, levelsof family income and education, race (whiteversus non-white). The NPHS categorized familyincome into \ufb01ve levels based on total family in-come and the number of people in the house-hold. In this analysis, the \ufb01ve levels weregrouped into two categories (low family incomeversus middle and high family income). In theNPHS, the non-white category included 11 dif-ferent groups, i.e. Chinese, Native, Black, LatinAmerican, South Asian, Arab/West Asian,Filipino, South East Asian, Japanese, Koreanand others. Because of small numbers of par-ticipants with these ethnic backgrounds, theywere combined into one group (the non-white).In this analysis, educational levels were groupedinto secondary school graduation or less versushigher than secondary-school graduation. Sec-ondary-school graduation is equivalent to 13years of education in Canada.Clinical and psychosocial variablesClinical and psychosocial variables includenumber of long-term medical illnesses, child andadulthood traumatic events, recent life eventsand baseline and subsequent mental healthservice use. Long-term medical illnesses refer toillnesses diagnosed by health professionals,which were expected to last 6 months or longer.Work stress as a risk factor for MDE 867https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291704003241  Published online by Cambridge University PressPsychological variables included recent negativelife events which had occurred in the past 12months (10 questions about physical abuse, un-wanted pregnancy, abortion or miscarriage,major \ufb01nancial di\ufb03culties and serious problemsat work or in school); childhood and adulttrauma (seven questions about parental divorce,a lengthy hospital stay, prolonged parental un-employment, frequent parental alcohol or druguse and physical abuse). The childhood andadult traumatic events referred to events thatoccurred while the participant was a child or ateenager or before he/she moved out of thehouse. Speci\ufb01c questions about recent negativelife events and childhood trauma can be foundin Statistics Canada\u2019s document (StatisticsCanada, 1995). In this analysis, an answer of\u2018yes\u2019 to any question in each domain was de\ufb01nedas having experienced negative life events andchildhood trauma. In the NPHS, subjects wereasked \u2018In the past 12 months, have you seen ortalked on the telephone to a health professionalabout your emotional or mental health?\u2019 and\u2018Did you use antidepressants in the past month?\u2019Since antidepressants can only be prescribed byphysicians, both reported contacts with healthprofessionals about emotional or mental healthproblems or the use of antidepressants in thepreceding month were used to de\ufb01ne baselinemental health service use in this analysis.AnalysisPreliminary analysis showed that the distri-bution of work stress was not normal. Partici-pants were classi\ufb01ed into four groups based onthe quartile values of the work stress of theparticipants (25th percentile value =16; 50thpercentile value =19; 75th percentile value =23;100th percentile value =45). The incidence ofMDE based on the 1996\u20131997 NPHS data wascalculated for each group. Using the \ufb01rst quar-tile group as the reference, the associationbetween the levels of work stress and MDE wasestimated in the form of odds ratio (OR). Tocontrol for the e\ufb00ects of sociodemographic,clinical and psychosocial variables, the adjustedassociation was estimated using logistic regres-sion modeling. This was to determine if workstress was associated with the risk of MDE andif there was a dose\u2013response relationship be-tween levels of work stress and MDE. Thee\ufb00ects of baseline and subsequent mental healthservice use were controlled, because the risk ofhaving MDE might be a\ufb00ected by these factors(Wang, 2004 b). In the logistic regression, ageand number of long-term medical illnesses wereanalyzed as continuous variables. Strati\ufb01edanalyses were carried out to examine possiblee\ufb00ect modi\ufb01cations between work stress andselected variables. Logistic regression modelingwas used to identify independent factors as-sociated with MDE.The NPHS used multiple-staged, strati\ufb01edrandom-sampling procedures, and so samplingweights provided by Statistics Canada were usedin the analysis. The proportions reported inthis analysis were weighted to account for theuneven sampling probability and for non-response. The 95% con\ufb01dence intervals (CIs)were calculated using the bootstrap technique toaccount for the design e\ufb00ect. This analysis wasconducted usingSTATA 7.0 (StataCorp, 2003).RESULTSAmong the participants selected ( n=6633), 534(8.1%) did not provide information aboutMDE in the 1996\u20131997 NPHS. The number ofparticipants who provided complete infor-mation about MDE ( n=6099) in each quartilegroup by baseline work stress score was 1701,1359, 1759 and 1280 respectively. The partici-pants with incomplete information about MDEwere signi\ufb01cantly more likely to have had abaseline work stress score above the 75th per-centile [ x2(1)=9.60,p=0.01]. These participantswere excluded from the calculation of MDEincidence.The data showed that the relationship be-tween work stress and the risk of MDE was notlinear. The incidence of MDE in each quartilegroup was 2.0, 2.6, 3.0 and 7.1% respectively.Compared to the \ufb01rst quartile group, after ad-justing for the e\ufb00ects of sociodemographic,clinical and psychosocial variables, participantsin the second (OR 1 .16, 95% CI 0 .55\u20132.20) andthe third (OR 1.61, 95% CI 0.76\u20132.88) quartilegroup had a similar risk of having had MDE inthe past 12 months. However, those who had awork stress score higher than the 75th percentilehad an elevated risk of MDE (OR 2.98, 95% CI1.62\u20134.97), compared to the reference group.The \ufb01rst three quartile groups were combinedbecause of the similar risk of MDE. Work stress868 J. Wanghttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291704003241  Published online by Cambridge University Presswas strongly associated with MDE (crude OR2.95, 95% CI 1.89\u20134.19,p<0.01). Strati\ufb01edanalyses found no evidence of e\ufb00ect modi\ufb01cationbetween work stress and the selected socio-demographic, clinical and psychosocial vari-ables. Work stress was an independent riskfactor for MDE (OR 2 .29, 95% CI 1 .44\u20133.73),controlling for the e\ufb00ects of other variables. Inthe multivariate analysis, low educational level(OR 1 .70, 95% CI 1 .16\u20132.65), number of long-term medical illnesses (OR 1.15, 95% CI1.00\u20131.33), reported childhood and adult trau-matic events (OR 1 .51, 95% CI 1 .00\u20132.41) andsubsequent mental health service use (OR 16.94,95% CI 10.01\u201325.88) were positively associatedwith MDE. Recent negative life events andbaseline mental health service use were not as-sociated with MDE. They were excluded fromthe model. Although other sociodemographicvariables were not signi\ufb01cantly associated withMDE, they were retained in the model becauseof the importance of these variables in popu-lation health. In the model without recentnegative life events and baseline mental healthservice use, the association between workstress and MDE did not change dramatically(Table 1). A high level of work stress, a loweducational level, the number of chronic ill-nesses, reported childhood and adult traumaticevents and subsequent mental health service usewere positively associated with MDE. Resultsfrom the model showed no evidence that thesociodemographic, clinical and psychologicalvariables acted as confounders in the relation-ship between work stress and MDE.DISCUSSIONUsing a large representative community-basedsample, this analysis demonstrates that a highlevel of work stress is associated with an elev-ated risk of MDE. This \ufb01nding is in line with theexisting theory (Karasek & Theorell, 1990). Therelationship between work stress and the risk ofMDE is not linear.The NPHS data showed that only those whoscored above the 75th percentile on the workstress scale had an elevated risk of MDE inthe follow-up period. Although the full andabbreviated versions of the JCQ have been usedextensively, no attempts have been made todetermine to what extent a work stress scoremay indicate a high level of stress. Based on theresults of this analysis, the 75th percentile maybe considered as a threshold for de\ufb01ning a highlevel of work stress in future studies. It shouldbe noted, however, that the results of thisanalysis did not consider the e\ufb00ect of speci\ufb01cprofessions. For certain types of professions,one could be at the 50th percentile but have anincreased risk of MDE.The literature indicates that various socio-demographic, clinical and psychological factorsare associated with major depression. The resultsof this analysis showed that work stress did notinteract with selected sociodemographic, clinicaland psychosocial variables to increase the riskof MDE. There was no evidence that therelationship between work stress and MDE wasconfounded by the e\ufb00ects of these variables.Work stress, a low educational level, number oflong-term medical illnesses and childhood trau-matic events were independent risk factors forMDE in the working population.The underlying mechanisms, whereby workstress a\ufb00ects the development of major de-pression, is not clear. Biologically, there may bemany pathways leading to the onset of adepressive syndrome, but major depression isincreasingly viewed as an abnormality of stress-adaptation systems in the brain (Shelton, 2000).Work stress may simply represent an importantcategory of stressful life event. There is evidencethat work stress may, in certain circumstances,overwhelm the body\u2019s neuroendocrine systems(Kunz-Ebrecht et al. 2004), which may lead tothe development of a depressive disorder.

It is wellrecognized that past mental health problems arestrongly related to the development of majordepression. Unfortunately, as a general healthsurvey, the NPHS did not collect informationabout the history of mental health problems.Although, a low educational level cannot be adirect cause of major depression because of alack of biological basis, people with a low edu-cational level are more likely to be exposed to astressful environment and expose themselves tounhealthy health behavior, both of which havemore direct impacts on mental health (Adler &Newman, 2002).In the multivariate analysis, subsequent men-tal health service use was strongly associatedwith MDE. In this longitudinal cohort, thismight be because subsequent mental healthservice use referred to the same time period asMDE. It was reasonable to expect that in-dividuals with MDE were more likely to usemental health services, compared to those whodid not have MDE.Patten (2000) reported that women had ahigher incidence of major depression than men.De Graaf and colleagues (2002) found that, inThe Netherlands Mental Health Survey andIncidence Study, gender di\ufb00erence in the inci-dence of major depression persisted even afterthe e\ufb00ects of socio-economic status, recent lifeevents and traumatic events were controlled. Aninteresting \ufb01nding of the current analysis wasthat, in the logistic regression models, genderwas not associated with MDE. This particularresult suggests that gender di\ufb00erence in the in-cidence of MDE might be due to the joint con-founding e\ufb00ects of work stress, psychosocialand clinical variables. This needs to be in-vestigated in future studies.This analysis had several limitations, whichmight cause biases. First, the NPHS data wereself-reported. Therefore, there was a possibilityof reporting bias. Second, the work stress scaleused in the NPHS is a brief version of the JCQ.It might not capture all important aspects ofwork stress. Similarly, only 10 questions aboutrecent negative life events in the past 12 monthswere asked in the NPHS. This might partly ex-plain the non-signi\ufb01cant association with MDE.Third, in the NPHS, MDE referred to a majordepressive episode in the past 12 months. TheNPHS longitudinal cohort was interviewedevery 2 years. Information about MDE in theyear immediately after the baseline survey wasnot available. Therefore, the term \u2018incidence\u2019used in this analysis was di\ufb00erent from thattraditionally used in epidemiology. Fourth,MDE was measured by the CIDI-SFMD de-rived from the full version of CIDI. MDE inthe NPHS may represent a broad spectrum ofmood disorders. Nevertheless, work stress wasfound to be strongly associated with MDE inthis longitudinal analysis. This was consistentwith the theoretical frameworks and the \ufb01nd-ings from the cross-sectional and longitudinalstudies. Finally, approximately 8.1% of theeligible participants did not provide completeinformation about MDE in the 1996\u20131997NPHS. Compared to those with complete in-formation, these participants were more likelyto have had a work stress above the 75th percen-tile. If individuals with a work stress scoreabove the 75th percentile were more likely todevelop MDE, the association between workstress and MDE observed in this analysis couldwell have been underestimated.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe research and data analysis were performedusing data from Statistics Canada.
