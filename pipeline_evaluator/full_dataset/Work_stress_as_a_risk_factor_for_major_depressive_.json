Major depression is a prevalent mental disorder in the general population, with a\nmulti-factorial etiology. However, work stress as a risk factor for major depression has not been\nwell studied.\n\nMethod. Using a longitudinal study design, this analysis investigated the association between the\nlevels of work stress and major depressive episode(s) in the Canadian working population, aged 18\nto 64 years. Data from the longitudinal cohort of the Canadian National Population Health Survey\n(NPHS) were used (n=6663). The NPHS participants who did not have major depressive episodes\n(MDE) at baseline (1994-1995 NPHS) were classified into four groups by the quartile values of the\nbaseline work stress scores. The proportion of MDE of each group was calculated using the\n1996-1997 NPHS data.\n\nResults. The first three quartile groups had a similar risk of MDE. Those who had a work stress\nscore above the 75th percentile had an elevated risk of MDE (7-1 %). Using the 75th percentile as a\ncut-off, work stress was significantly associated with the risk of MDE in multivariate analysis (odds\nratio=2-35, 95% confidence interval 1-54-3-77). Other factors associated with MDE in multi-\nvariate analysis included educational level, number of chronic medical illnesses and child and\nadulthood traumatic events. There was no evidence of effect modification between work stress and\nselected sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial variables.\n\nConclusions. Work stress is an independent risk factor for the development of MDE in the working\npopulation. Strategies to improve working environment are needed to keep workers mentally\nhealthy and productive.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMajor depression is one of the most prevalent\nmental disorders and has a multi-factorial\netiology. In addition to genetic factors, child-\nhood traumatic events and recent stressful life\nevents have been found to be strong risk factors\nfor major depression (Kendler ef al. 2002). In\nthe workplace, however, one important risk\nfactor for depressive disorders may be work\nstress. The demand-control model posits that\n\n* Address for correspondence: Dr JianLi Wang, Department of\nPsychiatry, Peter Lougheed Centre, Room 3645, 3500-26 Ave NE,\nCalgary, Alberta, Canada, TIY 614\n\n(Email: jianli.wang@calgaryhealthregion.ca)\n\nthe situations in which one\u2019s control over one\u2019s\nwork is low and the psychological demands\nimposed by one\u2019s work are high may lead the\nnegative outcomes, such as fatigue and de-\npression (Karasek & Theorell, 1990). Previous\nstudies indicate that work stress increases the\nrisk of physical illnesses (Theorell et al. 1998;\nMelamed ef al. 1999; Myers et al. 1999) and of\npsychological distress (Matthews er al. 2001;\nBultmann er al. 2002) and is associated with\nthe level of depressive symptoms (Iwata ef al.\n1988; Stansfeld er al. 1997, 1999). However,\nwork stress as a potential risk factor for major\ndepressive episodes (MDE) has not been\nexamined.\n\n865\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50033291704003241 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n\n866\n\nIn occupational health research, work stress\nhas been commonly measured by the Job Con-\ntent Questionnaire (JCQ; Karasek et al. 1998)\nor by its modified versions based upon the\ndemand-control model. The JCQ assesses work\nstress in six dimensions: skill discretion, decision\nauthority, psychological demand, job insecurity,\nphysical exertion and support from supervisor\nor co-workers. Cross-sectional studies using the\ndata from the Epidemiological Catchment Area\nstudy (Mausner-Dorsch & Eaton, 2000) and\nfrom the Canadian National Population Health\nSurvey (NPHS; Wang & Patten, 2001) reported\nthat certain dimensions of work stress were\nassociated with MDE. A longitudinal study using\nthe NPHS data found that MDE was associated\nwith high levels of work stress in skill discretion,\npsychological demand, job insecurity and sup-\nport from supervisors or co-workers as measured\nby the abbreviated version of the JCQ (Wang,\n2004 a). Identifying specific job characteristics\nassociated with poor mental health may assist in\nre-designing organizational structure to improve\nworkers\u2019 productivity. However, the work stress\ndimensions are likely to be correlated to each\nother. Thus, investigating the relationship\nbetween overall work stress and depression will\nimprove our understanding about the etiology\nof depressive disorders. Additionally, the median\nvalue of work stress has been used as a cut-off\npoint for defining high and low levels of work\nstress in the literature (Achat er al. 2000;\nMausner-Dorsch & Eaton, 2000; Rosvall et al.\n2002; Eaker et al. 2004). The justifications for\nsuch a classification schema were not sufficient.\nInvestigating the relationship between overall\nwork stress and MDE from a longitudinal per-\nspective may shed light on this important\nmethodological issue.\n\nUsing the data from the longitudinal cohort\nof the NPHS, the objectives of this analysis were\nto:\n\n(1) investigate the relationship between the\nlevels of work stress and later occurrence of\nMDE, and\n\n(2) examine if work stress interacts with\nbaseline sociodemographic, clinical and psycho-\nsocial factors to increase the risk of MDE.\n\nIt was hypothesized that individuals who were\nat a high level of work stress were more likely to\nhave had MDE and that work stress did not\ninteract with baseline sociodemographic, clinical\n\nJ. Wang\n\nand psychosocial factors to increase the risk\nof MDE.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHOD\nPopulation and design\n\nThe NPHS initiated in 1994-1995 is a national\nhealth survey using stratified two-stage random\nsampling procedures (Statistics Canada, 1996).\nThe target population consisted of household\nresidents in all Canadian provinces, excluding\nthose living on Indian Reserves, Canadian\nForces bases, in long-term institutions and in\ncertain remote areas in Quebec and Ontario\n(Statistics Canada, 1996). Within provinces the\nsample was distributed proportionally to the\npopulation size. In the first stage of sampling,\nhomogeneous strata based upon geographic\nand/or socio-economic status were formed and\nindependent samples of clusters (usually Census\nEnumeration Areas) were drawn from each\nstratum. In the second stage, dwelling lists were\nprepared for each cluster and dwellings or\nhouseholds were selected from the lists. The\nparticipants in the 1994-1995 NPHS formed a\nlongitudinal cohort which was re-interviewed\nevery 2 years. The baseline NPHS interviews\nwere conducted face-to-face by interviewers\ntrained by Statistics Canada. Telephone inter-\nviewing was the major data collection method\nin subsequent surveys (Swain et al. 1999). After\na complete description of the study to the sub-\njects, written informed consent was obtained.\nThe longitudinal response rate for the 1995\n1996 NPHS was 93-6 % (Swain et al. 1999). For\nthis analysis, data from the 1994-1995 NPHS\n(baseline) and the 1996-1997 NPHS were used.\nIn the baseline survey, 17276 participants were\ninterviewed. Among these, 6633 were aged\nbetween 18 and 64 years, were employed at the\ntime of the interviews, provided complete in-\nformation about work stress and had not had\nMDE in the 12 months prior to the interviews.\nThese subjects were included in this analysis.\n\nMDE\n\nMDE in the past 12 months was evaluated in\nthe NPHS using the Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview \u2014 Short Form for Major\nDepression (CIDI-SFMD) which was derived\nfrom the World Health Organization\u2019s Com-\nposite International Diagnostic Interview. The\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50033291704003241 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n\nWork stress as a risk factor for MDE\n\nCIDI-SFMD was developed and validated\nagainst the full version of CIDI (Kessler ef al.\n1998). A probability of 0-9 based on the CIDI-\nSFMD was defined the \u2018caseness\u2019 of MDE,\nbased upon the criteria of DSM-III-R (APA,\n1987). This cut-point corresponds to reporting 5\nout of 8 depressive symptoms outlined in the\nDSM, at least one of which must be depressed\nmood or loss of interest. This choice of a cut-\npoint can be justified by its face validity for the\nDSM-IV criteria (APA, 1994).\n\nWork stress\n\nThe NPHS used a brief version (12 items) of the\nJCQ (Karasek et al. 1998) to measure work\nstress in six dimensions. The 12 questions used\nin the NPHS are as follows.\n\nSkill discretion\n\n(1) Your job required that you learn new things.\n\n(2) Your job required a high level of skill.\n\n(3) Your job required that you do things over\nand over.\n\nDecision authority\n\n(4) Your job allowed you freedom to decide how\nyou did your job.\n\n(5) You had a lot to say about what happened in\nyour job.\n\nPsychological demands\n\n(6) Your job was very hectic.\n(7) You were free from conflicting demands that\nothers made.\n\nJob insecurity\n(8) Your job security was good.\n\nPhysical exertion\n(9) Your job required a lot of physical effort.\n\nSocial support from co-workers and supervisors\n\n(10) You were exposed to hostility or conflict\nfrom the people you worked with.\n\n(11) Your supervisor was helpful in getting the\njob done.\n\n(12) The people you work with were helpful in\ngetting the job done.\n\nThe answer to each question was based upon\na 5-point scale (0=strongly agree, 1=agree,\n2=neither agree nor disagree, 3=disagree,\n\n867\n\n4 =strongly disagree). The scores were reversed\nfor items 3,6,9 and 10. The total score of the\nJCQ was 48, with a high score indicating a\nhigher level of work stress. In the 1994-1995\nNPHS, the abbreviated version of the JCQ\nhad a moderate internal consistency (a=0-48).\nHowever, the moderate internal consistency\ndoes not necessarily mean that the abbreviated\nversion of the JCQ was insensitive. According to\nMcDowell & Newell (1996), an internal con-\nsistency is related to the number of items of the\nmeasurement, that a moderate internal consist-\nency may indicate that there is no redundancy in\nthe measurement and that each item adds new\ninformation to the measure. If an instrument\ncovers several dimensions (in the JCQ, six\ndimensions of work stress are assessed), it is\nreasonable to expect a moderate internal con-\nsistency (Boyle, 1985). All eligible participants\nprovided information about work stress.\n\nSociodemographic variables\n\nSociodemographic variables included in this\nanalysis are: gender, age, marital status, levels\nof family income and education, race (white\nversus non-white). The NPHS categorized family\nincome into five levels based on total family in-\ncome and the number of people in the house-\nhold. In this analysis, the five levels were\ngrouped into two categories (low family income\nversus middle and high family income). In the\nNPHS, the non-white category included 11 dif-\nferent groups, i.e. Chinese, Native, Black, Latin\nAmerican, South Asian, Arab/West Asian,\nFilipino, South East Asian, Japanese, Korean\nand others. Because of small numbers of par-\nticipants with these ethnic backgrounds, they\nwere combined into one group (the non-white).\nIn this analysis, educational levels were grouped\ninto secondary school graduation or less versus\nhigher than secondary-school graduation. Sec-\nondary-school graduation is equivalent to 13\nyears of education in Canada.\n\nClinical and psychosocial variables\n\nClinical and psychosocial variables include\nnumber of long-term medical illnesses, child and\nadulthood traumatic events, recent life events\nand baseline and subsequent mental health\nservice use. Long-term medical illnesses refer to\nillnesses diagnosed by health professionals,\nwhich were expected to last 6 months or longer.\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50033291704003241 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n\n868\n\nPsychological variables included recent negative\nlife events which had occurred in the past 12\nmonths (10 questions about physical abuse, un-\nwanted pregnancy, abortion or miscarriage,\nmajor financial difficulties and serious problems\nat work or in school); childhood and adult\ntrauma (seven questions about parental divorce,\na lengthy hospital stay, prolonged parental un-\nemployment, frequent parental alcohol or drug\nuse and physical abuse). The childhood and\nadult traumatic events referred to events that\noccurred while the participant was a child or a\nteenager or before he/she moved out of the\nhouse. Specific questions about recent negative\nlife events and childhood trauma can be found\nin Statistics Canada\u2019s document (Statistics\nCanada, 1995). In this analysis, an answer of\n\u2018yes\u2019 to any question in each domain was defined\nas having experienced negative life events and\nchildhood trauma. In the NPHS, subjects were\nasked \u2018In the past 12 months, have you seen or\ntalked on the telephone to a health professional\nabout your emotional or mental health?\u2019 and\n\u2018Did you use antidepressants in the past month?\u201d\nSince antidepressants can only be prescribed by\nphysicians, both reported contacts with health\nprofessionals about emotional or mental health\nproblems or the use of antidepressants in the\npreceding month were used to define baseline\nmental health service use in this analysis.\n\nAnalysis\n\nPreliminary analysis showed that the distri-\nbution of work stress was not normal. Partici-\npants were classified into four groups based on\nthe quartile values of the work stress of the\nparticipants (25th percentile value=16; 50th\npercentile value =19; 75th percentile value =23;\n100th percentile value=45). The incidence of\nMDE based on the 1996-1997 NPHS data was\ncalculated for each group. Using the first quar-\ntile group as the reference, the association\nbetween the levels of work stress and MDE was\nestimated in the form of odds ratio (OR). To\ncontrol for the effects of sociodemographic,\nclinical and psychosocial variables, the adjusted\nassociation was estimated using logistic regres-\nsion modeling. This was to determine if work\nstress was associated with the risk of MDE and\nif there was a dose-response relationship be-\ntween levels of work stress and MDE. The\neffects of baseline and subsequent mental health\n\nJ. Wang\n\nservice use were controlled, because the risk of\nhaving MDE might be affected by these factors\n(Wang, 20045). In the logistic regression, age\nand number of long-term medical illnesses were\nanalyzed as continuous variables. Stratified\nanalyses were carried out to examine possible\neffect modifications between work stress and\nselected variables. Logistic regression modeling\nwas used to identify independent factors as-\nsociated with MDE.\n\nThe NPHS used multiple-staged, stratified\nrandom-sampling procedures, and so sampling\nweights provided by Statistics Canada were used\nin the analysis. The proportions reported in\nthis analysis were weighted to account for the\nuneven sampling probability and for non-\nresponse. The 95% confidence intervals (Cls)\nwere calculated using the bootstrap technique to\naccount for the design effect. This analysis was\nconducted using stata 7.0 (StataCorp, 2003).\n\nRESULTS\n\nAmong the participants selected (n=6633), 534\n(81%) did not provide information about\nMDE in the 1996-1997 NPHS. The number of\nparticipants who provided complete infor-\nmation about MDE (n=6099) in each quartile\ngroup by baseline work stress score was 1701,\n1359, 1759 and 1280 respectively. The partici-\npants with incomplete information about MDE\nwere significantly more likely to have had a\nbaseline work stress score above the 75th per-\ncentile [*(1)=9-60, p=0-01]. These participants\nwere excluded from the calculation of MDE\nincidence.\n\nThe data showed that the relationship be-\ntween work stress and the risk of MDE was not\nlinear.\n\nCompared to the first quartile group, after ad-\njusting for the effects of sociodemographic,\nclinical and psychosocial variables, participants\nin the second (OR 1-16, 95% CI 0-55-2-20) and\nthe third (OR 1-61, 95% CI 0-76-2-88) quartile\n\ngroup had a similar risk of having had MDE in\nthe past 12 months. However, those who had a\nwork stress score higher than the 75th percentile\nhad an elevated risk of MDE (OR 2-98, 95% CI\n1:62-4:97), compared to the reference group.\nThe first three quartile groups were combined\nbecause of the similar risk of MDE.

Although other sociodemographic\nvariables were not significantly associated with\nMDE, they were retained in the model because\nof the importance of these variables in popu-\nlation health. In the model without recent\nnegative life events and baseline mental health\nservice use, the association between work\nstress and MDE did not change dramatically\n(Table 1). A high level of work stress, a low\neducational level, the number of chronic ill-\nnesses, reported childhood and adult traumatic\nevents and subsequent mental health service use\nwere positively associated with MDE. Results\nfrom the model showed no evidence that the\nsociodemographic, clinical and psychological\nvariables acted as confounders in the relation-\nship between work stress and MDE.\n\n869\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nUsing a large representative community-based\nsample, this analysis demonstrates that a high\nlevel of work stress is associated with an elev-\nated risk of MDE. This finding is in line with the\nexisting theory (Karasek & Theorell, 1990). The\nrelationship between work stress and the risk of\nMDE is not linear.\n\nThe NPHS data showed that only those who\nscored above the 75th percentile on the work\nstress scale had an elevated risk of MDE in\nthe follow-up period. Although the full and\nabbreviated versions of the JCQ have been used\nextensively, no attempts have been made to\ndetermine to what extent a work stress score\nmay indicate a high level of stress. Based on the\nresults of this analysis, the 75th percentile may\nbe considered as a threshold for defining a high\nlevel of work stress in future studies. It should\nbe noted, however, that the results of this\nanalysis did not consider the effect of specific\nprofessions. For certain types of professions,\none could be at the 50th percentile but have an\nincreased risk of MDE.\n\nThe literature indicates that various socio-\ndemographic, clinical and psychological factors\nare associated with major depression. The results\nof this analysis showed that work stress did not\ninteract with selected sociodemographic, clinical\nand psychosocial variables to increase the risk\nof MDE. There was no evidence that the\nrelationship between work stress and MDE was\nconfounded by the effects of these variables.\n\u2018Work stress, a low educational level, number of\nlong-term medical illnesses and childhood trau-\nmatic events were independent risk factors for\nMDE in the working population.\n\nThe underlying mechanisms, whereby work\nstress affects the development of major de-\npression, is not clear. Biologically, there may be\nmany pathways leading to the onset of a\ndepressive syndrome, but major depression is\nincreasingly viewed as an abnormality of stress-\nadaptation systems in the brain (Shelton, 2000).\n\u2018Work stress may simply represent an important\ncategory of stressful life event. There is evidence\nthat work stress may, in certain circumstances,\noverwhelm the body\u2019s neuroendocrine systems\n(Kunz-Ebrecht et al. 2004), which may lead to\nthe development of a depressive disorder. An\nalternative explanation about the association\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50033291704003241 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n\n870\n\nbetween work stress and MDE might be that\nindividuals with a history of mental health\nproblems were more likely to experience and to\nreport a high level of work stress. It is well\nrecognized that past mental health problems are\nstrongly related to the development of major\ndepression. Unfortunately, as a general health\nsurvey, the NPHS did not collect information\nabout the history of mental health problems.\nAlthough, a low educational level cannot be a\ndirect cause of major depression because of a\nlack of biological basis, people with a low edu-\ncational level are more likely to be exposed to a\nstressful environment and expose themselves to\nunhealthy health behavior, both of which have\nmore direct impacts on mental health (Adler &\nNewman, 2002).\n\nIn the multivariate analysis, subsequent men-\ntal health service use was strongly associated\nwith MDE. In this longitudinal cohort, this\nmight be because subsequent mental health\nservice use referred to the same time period as\nMDE. It was reasonable to expect that in-\ndividuals with MDE were more likely to use\nmental health services, compared to those who\ndid not have MDE.\n\nPatten (2000) reported that women had a\nhigher incidence of major depression than men.\nDe Graaf and colleagues (2002) found that, in\nThe Netherlands Mental Health Survey and\nIncidence Study, gender difference in the inci-\ndence of major depression persisted even after\nthe effects of socio-economic status, recent life\nevents and traumatic events were controlled. An\ninteresting finding of the current analysis was\nthat, in the logistic regression models, gender\nwas not associated with MDE. This particular\nresult suggests that gender difference in the in-\ncidence of MDE might be due to the joint con-\nfounding effects of work stress, psychosocial\nand clinical variables. This needs to be in-\nvestigated in future studies.\n\nThis analysis had several limitations, which\nmight cause biases. First, the NPHS data were\nself-reported. Therefore, there was a possibility\nof reporting bias. Second, the work stress scale\nused in the NPHS is a brief version of the JCQ.\nIt might not capture all important aspects of\nwork stress. Similarly, only 10 questions about\nrecent negative life events in the past 12 months\nwere asked in the NPHS. This might partly ex-\nplain the non-significant association with MDE.\n\nJ. Wang\n\nThird, in the NPHS, MDE referred to a major\ndepressive episode in the past 12 months. The\nNPHS longitudinal cohort was interviewed\nevery 2 years. Information about MDE in the\nyear immediately after the baseline survey was\nnot available. Therefore, the term \u2018incidence\u2019\nused in this analysis was different from that\ntraditionally used in epidemiology. Fourth,\nMDE was measured by the CIDI-SFMD de-\nrived from the full version of CIDI. MDE in\nthe NPHS may represent a broad spectrum of\nmood disorders. Nevertheless, work stress was\nfound to be strongly associated with MDE in\nthis longitudinal analysis. This was consistent\nwith the theoretical frameworks and the find-\nings from the cross-sectional and longitudinal\nstudies. Finally, approximately 8-1% of the\neligible participants did not provide complete\ninformation about MDE in the 1996-1997\nNPHS. Compared to those with complete in-\nformation, these participants were more likely\nto have had a work stress above the 75th percen-\ntile. If individuals with a work stress score\nabove the 75th percentile were more likely to\ndevelop MDE, the association between work\nstress and MDE observed in this analysis could\nwell have been underestimated.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe research and data analysis were performed\nusing data from Statistics Canada.
