Childhood Maltreatment May Affect MDDINTRODUCTIONMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatricdisorder ( 1), which usually leads people to su\ufb00ering fromemotional disturbances and cognitive impairments ( 2,3).Working memory (WM) involves the capability to memorize,retrieve, and utilize the information for a limited period ( 4)and is incredibly easily impaired in MDD patients ( 5,6).Numbersofstudiesfoundwidespreadincreasedbrainactivat ionsduring the cognitive process in MDD patients ( 7), includingtheanteriorprefrontalcortex(APFC)( 8),dorsolateralprefrontalcortex (9,10), and cingulate cortex ( 11). However, some studiesshowed hypoactive brain regions, including the frontal cort ex,temporal cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) an dparietal cortex in depressed patients ( 12\u201314). These divergentresults suggested the complexity of this issue, and potentialfactors might be the types of WM ( 15) and the levels ofstress. Besides, childhood maltreatment has been consider ed toaccelerate the development of depression ( 16\u201318). Moreover, adecreasedvolumeofprefrontalcortexmightplayamediatedro leintherelationshipbetweenchildhoodmaltreatmentanddec linedcognitive functioning ( 19\u201321). However, how can childhoodmaltreatment a\ufb00ect the WM process is complicated as stresshas both direct neuroendocrine ( 22) and indirect methylation(23) e\ufb00ects on the development of depression. We hypothesizedthat the neural basis of the childhood maltreatment e\ufb00ects atdi\ufb00erent WM task conditions were di\ufb00erent. To explore thishypothesis, we designed a WM task ( 24,25) with varyingsubtasks(maintenancevs.manipulation)andvaryingstress levels(non-competition vs. competition) to compare the childhoodmaltreatmente\ufb00ectsindi\ufb00erentconditions.MATERIALS AND METHODSParticipantsIn this study, 53 MDD patients and 64 healthy controls (HCs)were recruited. The patients were outpatients recruited fromPeking University Sixth Hospital. We used the Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Te xtRevision(DSM-IV-TR )diagnosticcriteriaofdepressiondisorder,without other comorbidities of the DSM-IV-TR Axis I disorders.Two psychiatrists assessed the patients by using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (version 5.0) ( 26). AllHCs were enrolled by advertising in the community and socialmedia and evaluated by using the Structured Clinical Intervi ewforDSM-IV-TR AxisIDisorders,ResearchVersion,Non-patientEdition to exclude any mental disorder ( 27). The currentstudy was approved by the ethical committee of the PekingUniversitySixthHospital.Alltheparticipantsweregivendeta iledinformation about the purpose and procedures of the study andsignedthewrittenconsents.We used the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) to evaluate the symptom severity ( 28). In addition, weused Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) to examine howcould childhood maltreatment a\ufb00ect brain function in adultMDD patients ( 29). Subjects were included using the followingcriteria: (1) between 18 and 55 years of age, (2) right-hande d,(3) Chinese Han lineage, and (4) MDD patients needed toget a HAMD-17 score \u226517. Subjects were excluded with thefollowing criteria: (1) any current or history of neurologic aldisease, (2) a history of more than 5-min loss of consciousnes s,(3) contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)scanning, (4) electroconvulsive therapy within 6 months orhistory of severe medical illness, (5) other genetic disease ,(6) serious impulsive behavior or suicide attempts, and (7)pregnancyandlactation.We excluded subjects with low image quality or who didnot complete the task (six MDD patients and four HCs)or with an accuracy rate of the maintenance <50% undercompetitive/non-competitive setting (two MDD patients, noHCs) or with head motion of more than 3\u25e6rotation/3-mmtranslation (eight MDD patients and six HCs). Finally, 37MDD subjects and 54 HCs were included in the analysis(Table1). Among the 37 patients, 10 patients were drug-naive.In addition, 17 MDD patients were taking selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors (\ufb02uoxetine, escitalopram, sertraline) , sixwere taking serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors(venlafaxine, duloxetine), two were taking noradrenergic a ndspeci\ufb01c serotonergic antidepressants (mirtazapine), one wastaking dopamine norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, DNRIs(bupropion),andonewastaking\ufb02upentixolandmelitracen.WM Paradigm and Image AcquisitionWe developed an event-related \u201cnumber calculation WM\u201dtask from previous works ( 30,31) and newly comprisedalternating competitive and non-competitive blocks ( Figure1).We validated that both the di\ufb00erent subtasks and the di\ufb00erentstress levels were successfully introduced in this task fro m ourprevious study ( 28), in which the detailed description of thistask could be found. A 3.0-T GE Discovery MR750 scannerwas used for scanning all participants at the Center for MRIResearch, Peking University Institute of Mental Health. TheparametersofthefunctionalMRIareasfollows:eachechoplanarimage included 33 (thickness/gap =4.2/0mm) axial slices,which covered the whole cerebrum and cerebellum (repetitiontime/echo time =2,000/30ms, \ufb02ip angle =90\u25e6, \ufb01eld of view =22.4\u00d722.4 cm2, matrix=64\u00d764).

Thepreprocessing of the data was performed as following steps:(1) slice timing correction, (2) realigning to the \ufb01rst volu meand correcting the head motion, (3) spatially normalizing int ostandard stereotaxic space (Montreal Neurological Institutetemplate) using a fourth-degree B-spline interpolation, and ( 4)using an 8-mm Gaussian kernel to spatial smoothing.

MDD patients had an average illness duration of 18.28months,withameanHAMD-17scoreof24.35.WealsoobtainedtheCTQforMDDpatients,andtheresultsarelistedin Table1.In terms of the accuracy rate, we observed a signi\ufb01cant maine\ufb00ect of stress with a higher accuracy rate under the stress ta sk(F=30.586,p<0.001), whereas, for task di\ufb00erence, we founda higher accuracy rate under maintenance task ( F=11.598,p<0.001). The interaction e\ufb00ects of task di\ufb00erence \u00d7stresswas signi\ufb01cant ( F=10.126,p=0.002;Figure2). However,no group di\ufb00erences were found between MDD patients andHCs (Table2). As for RT, we observed a signi\ufb01cant maine\ufb00ect of task di\ufb00erence, with longer RT in the manipulationcondition ( F=11.473,p=0.001). Meanwhile, we observed asigni\ufb01cant main e\ufb00ect of task-di\ufb00erence, with longer RT in themanipulation condition ( F=362.629,p<0.001).

Previous studies had observedreduced gray matter volume, thinner cortical thickness, an d lesssurface area of the fusiform gyrus in patients with depression(35\u201337). The fusiform gyrus may integrate the emotionaland cognitive processes by modulating the visual stimulatio nprocesses.Moreover,comparedtoHCs,theconnectivitybetweenthefusiformgyrusandmedialorbitofrontalcortexwasdecr easedin MDD patients ( 38), which suggested that the fusiform gyrushad an indirect e\ufb00ect on the WM function and emotionalmodulation.Inaddition,thereducedactivationoffusiform gyrusmay also be related to the impaired function of the attentionbiases of negatively emotional stimuli ( 32,39). We speculatedthatintheWMtask,theroleoftheemotionalstimuliprocessw asimpaired under both stress and non-stress settings or whethe rpatientswithMDDsawthefaceofacompetitorornot.Right Supplementary Motor AreaMeta-analyses showed consistent activation of SMA in the WMtask, which indicated that the SMA included in the widespreadfrontoparietal network was part of the core WM network ( 4,40,41). Besides, the visual attention function of executive func tionis regulated by the SMA, precentral gyrus and ACC corticalnetwork ( 42), which bene\ufb01ts the linking of sensory informationto the learning and execution of movement sequences ( 43).Reduced SMA volumes and impairment in implicit motorsequence learning have been observed in MDD patients ( 44).Meanwhile,Sarkheiletal.( 45)foundthattheSMAwasassociatedwith the psychomotor features (such as motor behavior) ofdepression, and they speculated that the increased functiona lconnectivity between the SMA and other regions might suggestthat recruiting more brain resources was needed for completi ngthe more complicated task in MDD patients. Moreover, MDDpatients were sensitive to stress ( 46). In our study, the decreasedactivation of SMA under non-stress but not stress setting mig htalso support this view. As a negative stimulation, the face of acompetitormighta\ufb00ectthevisualattentionofexecutivefunc tion,which resulted in \u201cthey potentially required additional seri almentalprocessingsteps\u201d( 47).Hence,thefunctionoftheSMAinMDD patients might be increased for making compensation inthe WM task under stress, which led to increasing the activat ionoftheSMAandreducingthedi\ufb00erencecomparedtoHCs.Anterior Prefrontal CortexStudies showed that the APFC (Brodmann area 10, BA10) wasinvolved in WM, episodic memory, prospective memory, andthe consideration of multiple relations in the meantime ( 48,49).Compared to children with non-depressed mothers, childrenwith depressed mothers showed decreased activation in theAPFC during the N-back task ( 50), which suggested that theactivation of APFC might be an endophenotype of depression.Besides, the activation of the APFC has been observed inrelativelysimpletasksandwouldincreasewiththedi\ufb03cultyl oadof WM task in healthy subjects ( 51).

(D)In MDD group, and the \u03b2estimations of the right APFC peak voxel under stress manipu lation subtask were negatively correlated with sexabuse (r= \u22120.43,p=0.008) and physical neglect ( r= \u22120.37,p=0.026) score in the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.and choice-di\ufb03culty e\ufb00ects associated with self-control ( 52).Besides, APFC is a brain region that is sensitive to stress ( 53),and subjects with posttrauma stress disorder showed decreas edgray matter volume in APFC compared with control subjects(54). Hence, MDD patients might keep the same cognitivecontrol function with HCs under the non-stress setting, or i nthe maintenance condition in the stress setting. However, f acingbothstressandmanipulationsubtask,whichmeansmorechoic edi\ufb03culties, the cognitive control function in MDD patients wa sdecreasedcomparedtoHCs.Childhood Sex Abuse and APFC ActivationChildhood maltreatment, symptoms of negative emotionality ,poor friend support, and externalizing problems in childhoodand adolescence are risk factors for early-onset MDD patients(55,56). Besides, childhood maltreatment can cause a series ofphysiological and neurohumoral reactions, including reduc edvolumes in the prefrontal cortex ( 57), and may lead individualsto being susceptible to depression ( 58\u201360). Previous studiesexhibited that the volumes of ventromedial PFC and rostralprefrontal cortex were reduced in children and adults whosu\ufb00ered from physical and sexual abuse ( 61,62). Furthermore,compared to individuals without childhood maltreatment, th eactivity in the MPFC was decreased in individuals who su\ufb00eredfrom childhood maltreatment during emotional and neutralmemory encoding and recognition ( 22). Meanwhile, substanceabuse and stress can bring about long-lasting changes bymodulating of gene expression or epigenetic mechanisms in thebrain, and indeed an abnormal pattern of genome-wide DNAmethylation in APFC of subjects with alcohol use disorder ( 63).In our study, childhood sex abuse might disrupt the functionof APFC in direct and indirect ways, such as brain activationand DNA methylation, and then contribute to the developmentofdepression.LIMITATIONSThere are several potential limitations in our study. First, thesample size was not large enough. Therefore, it was only a pilotstudy. In the future, we need to enlarge the sample to testand verify the current \ufb01ndings. Second, we did not distinguis hthe depression subtypes, which might be the reason why therewas no correlation between the \u03b2estimations of peak voxeland the HAMD-17 score. Therefore, we need to investigatethe di\ufb00erences among di\ufb00erent subtypes of depression andstudy the relationship between clinical symptoms and underli nemechanisminalargersample.CONCLUSIONIn our pilot study, the decreased brain activation of the leftfusiform gyrus, SMA, and APFC helps us to understand theabnormalities of the emotional stimuli processing function ,Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 671574Ma et al.
