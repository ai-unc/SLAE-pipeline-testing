Neuroimaging studies showed\ndivergent results of the WM process in MDD patients. Stress could affect the\noccurrence and development of depression, in which childhood maltreatment played\nan important role.\n\nMethods: Thirty-seven MDD patients and 54 healthy control subjects were enrolled\nand completed a WM functional magnetic resonance imaging task with maintenance\nand manipulation conditions under stress and non-stress settings. We collected\ndemographical and clinical data, using 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17)\nand Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) in MDD patients. In the WM task, we\nanalyzed the main diagnosis effect and explored the correlation of impaired brain regions\nin MDD patients with CTQ and HAMD-17.\n\nResults: No group differences were found in the accuracy rate and reaction time\nbetween the two groups. MDD patients had lower brain activation in following regions\n(Prwe < 0.05). The left fusiform gyrus showed less activation in all conditions. The right\nsupplementary motor area (SMA) exhibited decreased activation under non-stress. The\nanterior prefrontal cortex showed reduced activation during manipulation under stress,\nwith the g estimations of the peak voxel showing significant group difference negatively\ncorrelated with childhood sex abuse (Pgonferroni < 0.05).\n\nConclusions: In our pilot study, MDD patients had reduced brain activation, affecting\nemotional stimuli processing function, executive function, and cognitive control function.\nChildhood maltreatment might affect brain function in MDD. This work might provide\nsome information for future studies on MDD.\n\nKeywords: stress, major depression disorder, working memory, anterior prefrontal cortex, childhood maltreatment\n\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www. rontiersin.org\n\n1 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 671574\n\n\nMa etal\n\nChildhood Maltreatment May Affect MDD\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric\ndisorder (1), which usually leads people to suffering from\nemotional disturbances and cognitive impairments (2, 3).\n\u2018Working memory (WM) involves the capability to memorize,\nretrieve, and utilize the information for a limited period (4)\nand is incredibly easily impaired in MDD patients (5, 6).\nNumbers of studies found widespread increased brain activations\nduring the cognitive process in MDD patients (7), including\nthe anterior prefrontal cortex (APFC) (8), dorsolateral prefrontal\ncortex (9, 10), and cingulate cortex (11). However, some studies\nshowed hypoactive brain regions, including the frontal cortex,\ntemporal cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and\nparietal cortex in depressed patients (12-14). These divergent\nresults suggested the complexity of this issue, and potential\nfactors might be the types of WM (15) and the levels of\nstress. Besides, childhood maltreatment has been considered to\naccelerate the development of depression (16-18). Moreover, a\ndecreased volume of prefrontal cortex might play a mediated role\nin the relationship between childhood maltreatment and declined\ncognitive functioning (19-21). However, how can childhood\nmaltreatment affect the WM process is complicated as stress\nhas both direct neuroendocrine (22) and indirect methylation\n(23) effects on the development of depression. We hypothesized\nthat the neural basis of the childhood maltreatment effects at\ndifferent WM task conditions were different. To explore this\nhypothesis, we designed a WM task (24, 25) with varying\nsubtasks (maintenance vs. manipulation) and varying stress levels\n(non-competition vs. competition) to compare the childhood\n\u2018maltreatment effects in different conditions.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nParticipants\n\nIn this study, 53 MDD patients and 64 healthy controls (HCs)\nwere recruited. The patients were outpatients recruited from\nPeking University Sixth Hospital. We used the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text\nRevision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria of depression disorder,\nwithout other comorbidities of the DSM-IV-TR Axis I disorders.\nTwo psychiatrists assessed the patients by using the Mini-\nInternational Neuropsychiatric Interview (version 5.0) (26). All\nHCs were enrolled by advertising in the community and social\nmedia and evaluated by using the Structured Clinical Interview\nfor DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders, Research Version, Non-patient\nEdition to exclude any mental disorder (27). The current\nstudy was approved by the ethical committee of the Peking\nUniversity Sixth Hospital. All the participants were given detailed\ninformation about the purpose and procedures of the study and\nsigned the written consents.\n\nWe used the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-\n17) to evaluate the symptom severity (28). In addition, we\nused Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) to examine how\ncould childhood maltreatment affect brain function in adult\nMDD patients (29). Subjects were included using the following\ncriteria: (1) between 18 and 55 years of age, (2) right-handed,\n\n(3) Chinese Han lineage, and (4) MDD patients needed to\nget a HAMD-17 score >17. Subjects were excluded with the\nfollowing criteria: (1) any current or history of neurological\ndisease, (2) a history of more than 5-min loss of consciousness,\n(3) contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nscanning, (4) electroconvulsive therapy within 6 months or\nhistory of severe medical illness, (5) other genetic disease,\n(6) serious impulsive behavior or suicide attempts, and (7)\npregnancy and lactation.\n\nWe excluded subjects with low image quality or who did\nnot complete the task (six MDD patients and four HCs)\nor with an accuracy rate of the maintenance <50% under\ncompetitive/non-competitive setting (two MDD patients, no\nHCs) or with head motion of more than 3\u00b0 rotation/3-mm\ntranslation (eight MDD patients and six HCs). Finally, 37\nMDD subjects and 54 HCs were included in the analysis\n(Table 1). Among the 37 patients, 10 patients were drug-naive.\nIn addition, 17 MDD patients were taking selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, escitalopram, sertraline), six\nwere taking serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors\n(venlafaxine, duloxetine), two were taking noradrenergic and\nspecific serotonergic antidepressants (mirtazapine), one was\ntaking dopamine norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, DNRIs\n(bupropion), and one was taking flupentixol and melitracen.\n\nWM Paradigm and Image Acquisition\n\nWe developed an event-related \u201cnumber calculation WM\u201d\ntask from previous works (30, 31) and newly comprised\nalternating competitive and non-competitive blocks (Figure 1).\nWe validated that both the different subtasks and the different\nstress levels were successfully introduced in this task from our\nprevious study (28), in which the detailed description of this\ntask could be found. A 3.0-T GE Discovery MR750 scanner\nwas used for scanning all participants at the Center for MRI\nResearch, Peking University Institute of Mental Health. The\nparameters of the functional MRI are as follows: each echoplanar\nimage included 33 (thickness/gap = 4.2/0mm) axial slices,\nwhich covered the whole cerebrum and cerebellum (repetition\ntime/echo time = 2,000/30 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, field of view =\n22.4 x 22.4 cm?, matrix = 64 x 64). The protocol parameters\nwere selected for optimizing the quality and stability of the blood\noxygenation level-dependent signal with the exclusion of the first\nfour images as dummy scans.\n\nProcessing and Statistical Analyses of the\nMRI\n\nWe used MATLAB 2016b and SPMI2 (http://www.filion.\nuclac.uk/spm) for analyzing the functional MRI data. The\npreprocessing of the data was performed as following steps:\n(1) slice timing correction, (2) realigning to the first volume\nand correcting the head motion, (3) spatially normalizing into\nstandard stereotaxic space (Montreal Neurological Institute\ntemplate) using a fourth-degree B-spline interpolation, and (4)\nusing an 8-mm Gaussian kernel to spatial smoothing. After\npreprocessing, the voxel size of the image data was 3 x 3 x 3\nmm. We modeled every task-evoked stimulus as an independent\ndelta function, and it convolved with the typical hemodynamic\n\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org\n\nJuly 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 671574\n\n\nMa etal\n\nChildhood Maltreatment May Affect MDD\n\nTABLE 1 | Demographic and Behavioral Characteristics of MDD patients.\nand HCs.\n\nCharacteristic MDD HCs tx I\npatients (n=54\n(n=37)\n\nAge (years) 2580(475  2394(305) 2208 0032\n\nGender (female/male) 23/14 20/25 0641 0423\n\nEducation (years) 1654270) 1672(1.98)  -0870 0.712\n\nDuration of ilness 18.28 (20.92)\n\n(months)\n\nHAMD-17 score 24.35 (5.60)\n\nCTQ total score 40.86 (10.89)\n\nEmotional abuse 872 (3.40)\n\nscore of CTQ\n\nPhysical abuse score 6312.05)\n\nofCTQ\n\nSex abuse score of 5.92 (1.46)\n\ncra\n\nEmotional neglect 1261 (5.11)\n\nscore of CTQ\n\nPhysical neglect score 7.56 (3.02)\n\nofCTQ\n\nMDD, mejor depressive disorder; HC, healthy controls; HAMD-17, 17-item Hemiton\nDepression Rating Scale; CTQ, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.\n\nresponse function, controlling the systematic differences of global\nactivity by normalizing ratio to the whole-brain global mean.\nAnd we used a 128-s high-pass filter for temporal filter. We\nmodeled each event of task-evoked stimulus for performing\ntrials correctly. In addition, we modeled the residual movement\nand incorrect response parameters as regressors of no interest.\nIn this study, we planned to contrast the brain activation at\nthe maintenance subtask or manipulation subtask under stress,\nnon-stress setting and stress vs. non-stress, and between the\ntwo groups of MDD patients and HCs. Second-level analyses\nwere subsequently taken, and the variability of intersubject was\nregarded as a random effect.\n\nAfter controlling age, we used a flexible 2 x 2 analysis of\nvariance in SPM12 to analyze the main effect of diagnosis, the\nmain effect of stress, and the diagnosis x stress interaction\neffect. The significant level was set as p < 0.05 with whole-brain\nfamily-wise error (FWE) correction at both the maintenance\nsubtask and the manipulation WM subtask. Then, we compared\nthe main effect of diagnosis at stress maintenance, non-stress\nmaintenance, stress manipulation, and non-stress manipulation\nseparately in SPM12 to understand the group differences more\nspecifically under each WM condition. The second-level analyses\nwere carried on without any brain mask.\n\nStatistical Analyses of the Clinical and\nBehavioral Data\n\n\u2018We used a standard statistical package (IBM SPSS 26.0, Chicago,\nIL) to analyze demographic and clinical data, including t-test\nand x? test. The behavioral data [accuracy rate and reaction\ntime (RT)] of two groups at the maintenance or manipulation\nphase under stress or non-stress setting were analyzed by\n\nSPSS to explore the diagnosis x stress x task-difference\ninteraction effect.\n\nWe first extracted the B estimations in the corresponding\ncontrast images of each condition and setting in each group for\nthe peak coordinates found in the aforementioned second-level\nbrain image analyses. Then, we analyzed correlation between the\nB estimations values of the MDD group and the clinical variables\n(HAMD-17, CTQ). The level of statistical significance was set at\nPp < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nRESULTS\n\nDemographic and Behavioral Results\nWe studied 37 MDD patients and 54 HCs who were currently\nliving in Beijing. Both groups had similar gender distribution and\nhad achieved similar educational levels. While HCs were slightly\nyounger (Table 1). We included age as a covariate in subsequent\nanalyses. MDD patients had an average illness duration of 18.28\nmonths, with a mean HAMD-17 score of 24.35. We also obtained\nthe CTQ for MDD patients, and the results are listed in Table 1.\nIn terms of the accuracy rate, we observed a significant main\neffect of stress with a higher accuracy rate under the stress task\n(F = 30.586, p < 0.001), whereas, for task difference, we found\na higher accuracy rate under maintenance task (F = 11.598,\nPp < 0.001). The interaction effects of task difference x stress\nwas significant (F = 10.126, p = 0.002; Figure 2). However,\nno group differences were found between MDD patients and\nHCs (Table2). As for RT, we observed a significant main\neffect of task difference, with longer RT in the manipulation\ncondition (F = 11.473, p = 0.001). Meanwhile, we observed a\nsignificant main effect of task-difference, with longer RT in the\nmanipulation condition (F = 362.629, p < 0.001).

We found that compared to HCs, MDD\npatients showed comprehensive less brain activation during both\nthe WM maintenance and manipulation conditions. Particularly,\nwe found decreased brain activation in the left fusiform under\nboth stress and non-stress settings in both WM maintenance\nand manipulation conditions. Notably, the activation in the right\nSMA showed group differences in both WM maintenance and\nmanipulation conditions under non-stress but not stress setting.\nWe also found a reduced APFC activation in MDD under WM\nmanipulation task under stress setting, which was negatively\ncorrelated with the CTQ sex abuse.\n\nLeft Fusiform Gyrus\n\nOur study found that the activation of the left fusiform gyrus\nwas decreased in MDD patients in both maintenance and\nmanipulation conditions under non-stress or stress setting.\n\nThe fusiform gyrus is the most crucial part of the high-\nlevel visual cortex, which is associated with the recognition of\nfacial expressions (32, 33), integration of cognitive information,\nand emotional modulation (34). Previous studies had observed\nreduced gray matter volume, thinner cortical thickness, and less\nsurface area of the fusiform gyrus in patients with depression\n(35-37). The fusiform gyrus may integrate the emotional\nand cognitive processes by modulating the visual stimulation\nprocesses. Moreover, compared to HCs, the connectivity between\nthe fusiform gyrus and medial orbitofrontal cortex was decreased\nin MDD patients (38), which suggested that the fusiform gyrus\nhad an indirect effect on the WM function and emotional\nmodulation. In addition, the reduced activation of fusiform gyrus\nmay also be related to the impaired function of the attention\nbiases of negatively emotional stimuli (32, 39). We speculated\nthat in the WM task, the role of the emotional stimuli process was\nimpaired under both stress and non-stress settings or whether\npatients with MDD saw the face of a competitor or not.\n\nRight Supplementary Motor Area\n\nMeta-analyses showed consistent activation of SMA in the WM\ntask, which indicated that the SMA included in the widespread\nfrontoparietal network was part of the core WM network (4, 40,\n41). Besides, the visual attention function of executive function\nis regulated by the SMA, precentral gyrus and ACC cortical\nnetwork (42), which benefits the linking of sensory information\nto the learning and execution of movement sequences (43).\nReduced SMA volumes and impairment in implicit motor\nsequence learning have been observed in MDD patients (44).\nMeanwhile, Sarkheil et al. (45) found that the SMA was associated\nwith the psychomotor features (such as motor behavior) of\ndepression, and they speculated that the increased functional\nconnectivity between the SMA and other regions might suggest\nthat recruiting more brain resources was needed for completing\nthe more complicated task in MDD patients. Moreover, MDD\npatients were sensitive to stress (46). In our study, the decreased\nactivation of SMA under non-stress but not stress setting might\nalso support this view. As a negative stimulation, the face of a\ncompetitor might affect the visual attention of executive function,\nwhich resulted in \u201cthey potentially required additional serial\nmental processing steps\u201d (47). Hence, the function of the SMA in\nMDD patients might be increased for making compensation in\nthe WM task under stress, which led to increasing the activation\nof the SMA and reducing the difference compared to HCs.\n\nAnterior Prefrontal Cortex\n\nStudies showed that the APFC (Brodmann area 10, BA10) was\ninvolved in WM, episodic memory, prospective memory, and\nthe consideration of multiple relations in the meantime (48, 49).\nCompared to children with non-depressed mothers, children\nwith depressed mothers showed decreased activation in the\nAPFC during the N-back task (50), which suggested that the\nactivation of APFC might be an endophenotype of depression.\nBesides, the activation of the APFC has been observed in\nrelatively simple tasks and would increase with the difficulty load\nof WM task in healthy subjects (51). Moreover, a prior work\nreported that higher activation in the APFC was related to WM\n\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www. frontiersin.org\n\nJuly 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 671574\n\n\nMa etal\n\nChildhood Maltreatment May Affect MDD\n\nNon-Stress\nManipulation\n\nStress 3 Stress\nManipulation ) Maintenance\n\nFIGURE 4 | Group differences under working memory mai\n\nnance and manipulation\nand manipul\n\nthe ma\n\nmainter di\n\nns only in non-stre:\n\nmanipulation condition.

Hence, MDD patients might keep the same cognitive\ncontrol function with HCs under the non-stress setting, or in\nthe maintenance condition in the stress setting. However, facing\nboth stress and manipulation subtask, which means more choice\ndifficulties, the cognitive control function in MDD patients was\ndecreased compared to HC.\n\nChildhood Sex Abuse and APFC Activation\nChildhood maltreatment, symptoms of negative emotionality,\npoor friend support, and externalizing problems in childhood\nand adolescence are risk factors for early-onset MDD patients\n(55, 56). Besides, childhood maltreatment can cause a series of\nphysiological and neurohumoral reactions, including reduced\nvolumes in the prefrontal cortex (57), and may lead individuals\nto being susceptible to depression (58-60). Previous studies\nexhibited that the volumes of ventromedial PFC and rostral\nprefrontal cortex were reduced in children and adults who\nsuffered from physical and sexual abuse (61, 62). Furthermore,\ncompared to individuals without childhood maltreatment, the\nactivity in the MPFC was decreased in individuals who suffered\nfrom childhood maltreatment during emotional and neutral\n\u2018memory encoding and recognition (22).

First, the\nsample size was not large enough. Therefore, it was only a pilot\nstudy. In the future, we need to enlarge the sample to test\nand verify the current findings. Second, we did not distinguish\nthe depression subtypes, which might be the reason why there\nwas no correlation between the B estimations of peak voxel\nand the HAMD-17 score. Therefore, we need to investigate\nthe differences among different subtypes of depression and\nstudy the relationship between clinical symptoms and underline\nmechanism in a larger sample.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn our pilot study, the decreased brain activation of the left\nfusiform gyrus, SMA, and APFC helps us to understand the\nabnormalities of the emotional stimuli processing function,\n\n\n\nMa etal\n\nChildhood Maltreatment May Affect MDD\n\nexecutive function, and cognitive control function in MDD.\nChildhood maltreatment might play a crucial role in the\ndevelopment of MDD.
