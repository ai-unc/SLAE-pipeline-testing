Yet, when these deficitsemerge and how they relate to the depressed state is unclear. The aim of this 2-part systematic reviewand meta-analysis is to determine the pattern and extent of cognitive deficits during a first-episode ofdepression (FED) and their persistence following FED remission. Method: Published, peer-reviewedarticles on cognitive function in FED patients through October 2015 were searched. Meta-analyses withrandom-effects modeling were conducted. Part 1 assessed weighted, mean effect sizes of cognitivefunction in FED patients relative to healthy controls. Moderator analyses of clinical and demographicalvariables effects were conducted. Part 2 assessed weighted, mean effect sizes of change in cognitivefunction at remission compared with acute FED performance in longitudinal studies. Results: Thirty-onestudies including 994 FED patients were retained in Part 1. Relative to healthy controls, small to largeimpairments were observed across most cognitive domains. Remission was associated with a normal-ization of function in processing speed, learning and memory, autobiographical memory, shifting, and IQ.Lower FED age was associated with higher IQ, but more impairment in word-list delayed memory. Fourstudies including 92 FED patients were retained in Part 2. Following remission, FED patients showedsmall improvements in processing speed and shifting but persistent impairment in inhibition and verbalfluency. Conclusion: Significant cognitive deficits are already identifiable during a FED, with somefunctions showing persistent impairment upon remission. Clinicians must consider cognitive impairmentalongside mood symptoms to ensure functional recovery from the FED.Keywords: cognitive deficits, first-episode of depression, meta-analysis, remission, systematic reviewSupplemental materials: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/neu0000319.suppMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder charac-terized by a profound state of sadness, or loss of interest inactivities, for at least a 2-week duration. This is accompanied by aminimum of five symptoms affecting behavior (disturbed sleep,changes in appetite or weight, fatigue, slowed movement) and/orcognition (feelings of guilt, worthlessness, thoughts of death, dif-ficulty in concentration or indecisiveness; American PsychiatricAssociation, 2013 ). Typically, MDD is considered an episodicdisorder consisting of one or more depressive episodes; an episodeis defined by a minimum 2-week period, accompanied by five ofthe above-described symptoms, with a distinct onset and offset(Dubovsky & Dubovsky, 2002 ). MDD is one of the most prevalentof all mental disorders with an estimated 13.5% to 21.2% of thepopulation experiencing at least one episode of depression ( Kes-sler & Walters, 1998 ). However, recurrent depressive episodes arelikely in MDD with up to 80% experiencing more than one episodein their lifetime ( Mueller et al., 1999 ).Cognitive Deficits in MDDAlthough MDD is traditionally recognized as a disturbance ofmood, impaired cognitive function has been frequently describedas part of the disorder (e.g., Austin, Mitchell, & Goodwin, 2001 ).Cognitive functions are the mental processes of receiving, usingand preserving information, which are divided into domains suchas attention or memory ( Lezak, Howieson, Bigler, & Tranel,2012 ). While difficulties with concentration and making decisionshave been included as diagnostic criteria for MDD ( AmericanPsychiatric Association, 2013 ), cognitive deficits in processingspeed, attention, learning abilities, long-term memory, autobio-graphical memory, and executive function have also been demon-strated by numerous studies, reviews and meta-analyses. For ex-ample, a meta-analysis of 24 studies, including 784 MDD patients,quantified moderate cognitive deficits in executive function, mem-ory and attention relative to healthy controls ( Rock, Roiser, Riedel,& Blackwell, 2014 ). Moreover, another meta-analysis of 113 stud-ies focusing on executive functioning and including 3396 MDDpatients ( Snyder, 2013 ), showed large impairment in inhibition,and moderate impairment in shifting, verbal working memory,visuospatial working memory, and verbal fluency.Current evidence suggests that cognitive impairment in MDD isa key determinant of individual functional outcomes. It has beenshown to persist following depression remission ( Hasselbalch,Knorr, & Kessing, 2011 ), worsen with repeated depressive epi-sodes ( Gorwood, Corruble, Falissard, & Goodwin, 2008 ;Kessing,This article was published Online First October 10, 2016.Elayne Ahern and Maria Semkovska, Department of Psychology, Uni-versity of Limerick.Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to MariaSemkovska, Department of Psychology, office E1-033 University of Lim-erick, Castletroy, Co Limerick Ireland.

Moreover,difficulties with social functioning are also linked to cognitivedysfunction in depression ( Withall, Harris, & Cumming, 2009 ).Lost work productivity has been central to MDD-related societalcosts ( Evans et al., 2013 ) alongside the direct health care costsinvolved in treating MDD ( Ekman, Granstr\u00f6m, Om\u00e9rov, Jacob, &Land\u00e9n, 2013 ). Even following the remission of mood symptoms,baseline levels of daily functioning are not always restored. Recentaccounts have suggested that the persistence of cognitive impair-ment following depression remission might contribute to compro-mise a full, functional recovery ( Bortolato et al., 2016 ). Further-more, it has been suggested that cognitive remission should be nowconsidered as a therapeutic target to restore functioning and pre-vent relapse ( Bortolato et al., 2016 ;Lee, Hermens, Porter, &Redoblado-Hodge, 2012 ;Rock et al., 2014 ;Wekking, Bockting,Koeter, & Schene, 2012 ).Relation Between Course of MDD and CognitiveImpairmentCognitive impairment in MDD has usually been studied in termsof how it relates to the course of the illness, namely during an acuteepisode, following remission, in chronic depression, or in recurrentdepression ( Hammar & Ardal, 2009 ). Remission refers to a periodof minimal depressed symptoms experienced by the patient fol-lowing a depressive episode ( Zimmerman et al., 2006 ). It has beensuggested that cognitive impairment is a state marker and second-ary to depressed mood symptoms, that is, impairment is presentonly during the depressive episode and normalizes thereafter withremission. However, recent studies have demonstrated its persis-tence following remission. In a review of 11 studies on 500remitted MDD patients, Hasselbalch and colleagues (2011) docu-mented persistent impairment in attention, memory, and executivefunction relative to healthy controls. Following from this, a meta-analysis including 27 studies and 895 remitted, MDD patientsquantified the impairment as moderate to large with most cognitivedomains, but specifically the executive function of inhibition,showing persistent deficits ( Bora, Harrison, Yucel, & Pantelis,2013 ).Persistence of deficits following a depressive episode can beindicative of either an impairment present before even a first-episode of depression (FED) or adverse consequence of depres-sion. The trait marker hypothesis suggests that cognitive deficitsrepresent a stable, underlying vulnerability for the onset of FED, orsubsequent recurrent episodes. Trait markers specifically existbefore the FED, and show stable persistence throughout and intoremission ( Rohde, Lewinsohn, & Seeley, 1990 ). Population-basedstudies have suggested that poorer episodic memory is a traitmarker which predicts the onset of the FED ( Airaksinen, Wahlin,Forsell, & Larsson, 2007 ). Moreover, a 9-year longitudinal studyidentified impairment in attention and executive function as traitmarkers which predicted onset in healthy twins at high-risk todevelop an affective disorder ( Vinberg, Miskowiak, & Kessing,2013 ).Alternatively, the scar hypothesis proposes that cognitive im-pairment develops during the FED and persists as a consequenceor scar of the depressive episode, although the cognitive impair-ment may only be residual ( Lewinsohn, Steinmetz, Larson, &Franklin, 1981 ). This is related to neural changes that occur duringthe depressive episode, subsequently affecting cognitive function.Kessing (1998) demonstrated that each depressive episode wasassociated with greater cognitive impairment in remitted, recurrentMDD patients relative to remitted FED patients, or healthy con-trols. FED patients were not significantly different from controls.Similarly, in a sample of 1895 MDD tested during an episode andafter remission, Gorwood and colleagues (2008) demonstrated thatthe delayed verbal memory abilities progressively decrease aftereach consecutive depressive episode, despite patients havingachieved remission. Research, however, has been inconsistent,with sometimes no added impairment observed as a result of eachdepressive episode (e.g., Wekking et al., 2012 ).In summary, conclusive profiles characterizing cognitive im-pairment that is state -,trait-, or recurrence -related have not beendetermined, yet there is a recognition that cognitive deficits shouldbe addressed conjointly with the mood episode and early in thecourse of MDD occurrence. Which cognitive functions should betreated early remains debatable.Heterogeneity in MDD Cognitive Research and FEDCognitive ProfileMuch of the inconsistencies in cognitive research in MDD relateto differences in the patients assessed. Individual characteristicsare likely to moderate the extent of cognitive impairment, that is,certain characteristics determine whether more or less cognitiveimpairment is associated with MDD ( Hammar & Ardal, 2009 ).Moderator variables including female gender ( Postma, Jager, Kes-sels, Koppeschaar, & van Honk, 2004 ), lower premorbid intelli-gence, educational attainment ( Plassman et al., 1995 ), older age(Deary et al., 2009 ), medication, inpatient status, younger age ofdepression-onset, higher depression severity, comorbidity, psy-chotic features, number of past episodes, and length of theseepisodes have all been associated with greater cognitive impair-ment (for review see Porter, Bourke, & Gallagher, 2007 ).Notwithstanding the association between the number of epi-sodes and extent of impairment, the majority of research in MDDhas focused on samples with recurrent, depressive episodes ( Ham-mar & Ardal, 2009 ). To disentangle the above-described complex-ities in cognitive impairment MDD research relative to the state ,trait, and scar debate, it would be essential to start with describingthe cognitive profile associated with the state of FED. To the bestof our knowledge, only one meta-analysis of cognitive function inthe FED has been conducted, but limited to an adult population.Across 13 studies including 644 FED patients, small to moderatedeficits were observed in processing speed, attention, visual learn-ing and memory, shifting, verbal fluency, and cognitive flexibility(Lee et al., 2012 ). Following moderator analyses, including remis-sion status, the authors concluded that disturbances in psychomo-tor speed and memory functioning were probably state -related,whereas deficits in attention and executive function would be aMDD trait-marker.Lee and colleagues\u2019 meta-analysis (2012) was the first to dem-onstrate cognitive impairment in adult FED, a critical advance inThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.53 COGNITIVE DEFICITS FIRST-EPISODE DEPRESSIONneuropsychological MDD research. Nevertheless, their conclu-sions relative to the impairment severity within the different cog-nitive domains and relative to the trait/state debate could bequestioned, given the study\u2019s methodological limitations in termsof sample selection and choice of assessment for depression se-verity. First, the meta-analyses included mixed samples with 62%of the reviewed studies having samples containing both FED andrecurrent MDD. The inclusion of mixed samples might have led toan overestimation of FED-related cognitive impairment. For ex-ample, the meta-analyzed study of Reppermund and colleagues(2009) included 16 patients with FED and 37 with recurrent MDD,while results from the whole sample of 53 were meta-analyzed.Second, Lee and colleagues (2012) excluded samples where theindividuals\u2019 mean age was \u201cbelow 18. . .and primarily (greaterthan 50%) younger than 16,\u201d which limits the representativeness ofthe meta-analyzed samples. Indeed, previous research suggeststhat about 75% of all MDD patients have had their first FEDbetween the ages of 11 and 15 ( Kovacs et al., 1984 ;Lewinsohn,Hops, Roberts, Seeley, & Andrews, 1993 ). Also, a recent meta-analysis of 17 studies, including 447 children and adolescents withMDD, showed that moderate impairments are evident in attention,verbal memory, inhibition, and verbal fluency among this popu-lation relative to controls ( Wagner, M\u00fcller, Helmreich, Huss, &Tadi \u00b4c, 2015 ). Third, as the authors report, their inclusion of sam-ples with mean age up to 65 probably has increased the risk ofhaving included people with vascular pathologies that also impacton cognitive function ( Lee et al., 2012 ). Finally, the authorsdichotomized the moderator variable of depression severity into\u201ceuthymic\u201d ( /H11005no symptoms) and \u201csymptomatic\u201d ( /H11005mild orgreater symptoms). This dichotomization prevents the assessmentof the effect of depression severity on the observed outcomes.Indeed, greater depression severity has been associated with largercognitive impairments ( McDermott & Ebmeier, 2009 ).To advance the debate of state/trait characteristic of cognitiveimpairment in depression, an updated meta-analysis to describe thecognitive profile of FED, which addresses the above-describedlimitations, is needed. Thus, the aims of the present systematicreview and meta-analysis are: (a) to determine the pattern andprovide a quantitative estimate of the extent of cognitive deficits inFED patients compared with healthy controls; (b) to examine thecontribution of moderator variables to the extent of this cognitiveimpairment; and (c) to explore the persistence of cognitive impair-ment following FED remission. For the purpose of this review andmeta-analysis, cognitive impairment refers to a level of function-ing below that of the healthy, normal population that interfereswith daily life ( Lezak et al., 2012 ).MethodA two-part systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted.Part 1 of the meta-analysis examined cognitive function in FEDpatients relative to healthy controls. Part 2 reviewed studies thatfollowed FED in remission to further explore the persistence ofthese cognitive deficits. The repeated assessment of FED patientsis considered a more valid measure of persistence as patients arecompared with their own baseline performance, eliminating thepossibility of individual differences when remitted FED patientsare compared with healthy controls ( Douglas & Porter, 2009 ).PRISMA guidelines for conducting and reporting systematicreviews and meta-analyses were followed ( Moher, Liberati, Tet-zlaff, & Altman, 2009 ).Search StrategyThe electronic databases PsycINFO, PsycArticles, MEDLINE,Embase, and PubMed were searched from the year 1980 to Octo-ber 2015. The year 1980 was selected as this was when the term\u201cmajor depressive disorder\u201d was introduced to the Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders , third edition ( DSM\u2013III ;American Psychiatric Association, 1980 ) and for the most part,diagnostic criteria has remained the same since ( Uher, Payne,Pavlova, & Perlis, 2014 ). The following search terms were used\u201cfirst depressive episode\u201d OR (\u201cfirst episode\u201d OR \u201csingle episode\u201dAND [\u201cmajor depressive disorder\u201d OR \u201cmajor depressive epi-sode\u201d]) AND (neurocognit/H11569OR cognit/H11569OR neuropsycholog/H11569OR\u201cexecutive function\u201d OR attention OR memory OR orientationOR perception OR language OR verbal OR visual OR reasoningOR vigilance OR visuospatial OR \u201cproblem solving\u201d OR \u201cpro-cessing speed\u201d OR intelligence OR impairment). References fromrelevant reviews and articles returned from the databases werehand-searched to identify additional studies. Only published stud-ies were searched. For the purpose of this systematic review, astudy was defined as an article which did not share the samesample and cognitive tests with any other article. In cases ofredundancy, the most recent study with the largest sample size wasretained to ensure statistical independence of effect sizes ( Lipsey& Wilson, 2001 ).Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis ISelection criteria. For the systematic review, inclusion crite-ria for studies were as follows: (a) use of sample diagnosed withMDD according to DSM\u2013III ,DSM\u2013III\u2013R ,DSM\u2013IV ,DSM\u2013IV\u2013TR ,DSM-5 , ICD-9, or ICD-10 criteria; (b) participants must not havepreviously been diagnosed with a major depressive episode; (c)inclusion of a healthy, control comparison group; (d) Used at leastone objective cognitive test. Furthermore, for the meta-analysis, anadditional criterion required that the study reported means andstandard deviations of cognitive function in both FED patients andcontrols, or sufficient statistical data such as Fortstatistics whichcould be converted into effect sizes. Exclusion criteria were (a)mean age of the study sample /H1135055 years, (b) redundant reports,that is, separately published studies that have used the samecognitive tests on the same patient sample, (c) case series.Data extraction and recorded variables. Titles and abstractsreturned from the database search were screened for potentialinclusion against the selection criteria. Authors EA and MSsearched independently the selected databases using the above-described search strategy and identified independently potentiallyeligible studies. Their interrater agreement for studies\u2019 inclusion/exclusion categorization was 0.98. Potentially eligible articles (in-cluding the few that only EA or only MS identified) were retainedand full-texts located. The corresponding author was contacted ifthe full-text of a potentially eligible article could not be located.When sufficient detail was not reported, but articles met theremaining inclusion criteria, a request for the missing informationwas sent to the corresponding author. Authors who did not initiallyrespond were recontacted twice further.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.54 AHERN AND SEMKOVSKACognitive tests were categorized into 12 standard cognitive do-mains ( Lezak et al., 2012 ) also used in prior meta-analyses of cogni-tive function in MDD ( Lee et al., 2012 ;Snyder, 2013 ). A cognitivedomain was defined as a class of cognitive functions which could beassessed using one or numerous, different cognitive tests ( Lezak et al.,2012 ). As per standard categorizations, cognitive tests that used asimilar methodology to assess cognitive function were pooled to-gether within the cognitive domain, for example, the Rey AuditoryVerbal Learning Test and the California Verbal Learning Test bothmeasure verbal learning using a word-list methodology ( Lezak et al.,2012 ). A cognitive test was analyzed separately when two or morestudies reported on that test but it could not be pooled with other testsas methodologies were not comparable. All data analyzed were ini-tially extracted and categorized by the first author (E.A.). Second andprior to meta-analyses, the extracted data were cross-checked by thesecond author (M.S.) against the original publication or communica-tion from authors who provided their data. Disagreements relative tocategorization were resolved through discussion between the authors.Frequently, cognitive tests yield more than a single outcome ofperformance. For example, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test pro-vides results including errors and correct responses. It is recom-mended that cognitive outcomes are assessed separately to providea more detailed insight into the functions possibly compromised inMDD ( Snyder, 2013 ). Where possible, cognitive outcomes withinthe same domain were pooled together regardless of the specificcognitive test, for example, test errors, number of categoriesshifted between, number of trials taken to shift, correct responses,and time variables were formed within the shifting domain. Toaccount for small study numbers, an overall composite score wasformed for each domain by pooling all cognitive data categorizedwithin that domain. When necessary, effect sizes were averaged sothat each FED sample only contributed to one effect size peranalysis. This was done so as to avoid weighting individual studiesaccording to the number of tests or outcomes reported, in additionto ensuring statistical independence of effect sizes ( Lipsey &Wilson, 2001 ). Throughout, cognitive variable will be a generalterm to refer to all possible categorizations within a cognitivedomain, for example, cognitive test or composite score.The following were coded for each independent sample from eachstudy: (a) number of FED patients and controls; (b) cognitive testsadministered; (c) mean ( M) and standard deviation ( SD) scores ofperformance by FED patients and controls, or if not available, relevantinferential statistics; and (d) characteristics of patients (gender, de-pression severity, mean age, medication, patient status, current orremitted depression, premorbid intelligence, age of onset, educationalattainment, comorbidity, duration of FED).Meta-analysis. For each study, effect sizes were calculated asCohen\u2019s dto compare the performance of FED patients to controlson each cognitive variable. Cohen\u2019s deffect size was calculated asM2\u2013M1/SDpooled , where M2is the mean cognitive performance ofthe control group, M1is the mean cognitive performance of theFED group and SDpooled is the pooled standard deviation of thetwo groups. When MorSDwere not reported, or could not beobtained from the author, effect size was estimated from the Fstatistic using effect size calculation macros provided by Wilson(2001 ;k/H110051), or were estimated from the zstandard normaldeviate ( Rosenthal & DiMatteo, 2001 ;k/H110051).Hedges\u2019 gcorrection for small sample bias ( Hedges & Olkin,1985 ),g/H11005d/H208511/H11002/H2084934df/H110021/H20850/H20852, where dfequals the total numberof participants, considering the FED patient and control groupscombined, minus 2. A positive gindicated a poorer performanceby FED patients compared with controls. Therefore, the effect sizewas inverted for measures where higher scores indicated worseperformance, that is, errors, time and overgeneral autobiographicalmemory. Outliers were omitted only from the analyses in whichthey were outliers. An outlier was defined as an effect size /H113502o r/H110063SDs from the mean effect size of each analysis ( Snyder, 2013 ).When data was provided by FED patients at multiple time points,only baseline data were assessed so as to maintain statisticalindependence of effect sizes. In addition, this eliminated the pos-sibility of practice effects on test performance at follow-up assess-ments ( Lipsey & Wilson, 2001 ).Inverse-variance weighted, random-effects modeling was con-ducted to provide an estimate of the mean effect size across studiesfor each cognitive variable using Review Manager (v5.3; TheCochrane Collaboration, 2014 ). The random-effects model as-sumes that there is more variability between studies than samplingerror alone ( Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009 ). Thestudies included in this meta-analysis varied in terms of samplecharacteristics and the cognitive tests administered which neces-sitated the use of the random-effects model. Effect sizes wereweighted by its inverse variance so that effect sizes with largersamples would be given more weight ( Borenstein et al., 2009 ).For each analysis, a weighted, mean effect size and 95% con-fidence intervals were computed. The null hypothesis that theeffect size is 0 was tested with zwith an alpha level set at .05.Weighted, mean effect sizes were interpreted in accordance withthe recommendations of Cohen (1988) ,/H113500.2/H11005small,/H113500.5/H11005medium, /H113500.8/H11005large. Heterogeneity of effect sizes was assessedusing the Qstatistic. This tests the null hypothesis that the vari-ability between effect sizes in each study, contributing to theweighted, mean effect size, is attributable to chance. As the Qstatistic chi-squared test has low power in a meta-analysis with asmall number of studies a p-level of .10 was applied, as recom-mended by Cochrane ( Higgins & Green, 2008 );p/H11349.10 indicatedthat there was much variability between the study effect sizes ineach analysis. The I2index quantified the percentage of variabilityacross study effect sizes due to true differences and not chance.This was interpreted in accordance with the recommended cut-offs: 25% /H11005small, 50% /H11005moderate, and 75% /H11005large heteroge-neity ( Borenstein et al., 2009 ).Moderator analyses were conducted using a random-effects modelon Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (v.2.2; Biostat, n.d. ;Englewood, NJ) with the moderator variables prespecified.When/H1135010 samples reported on a continuous moderator variable(depression severity, patient age, and medication), it was enteredseparately into the metaregression model. Categorical variables, en-tered for subgroup analysis of variance, included patient status (inpa-tient vs. outpatient) and remission status (current depression vs. re-mission). A minimum of two studies in the smaller subgroup categorywas required for subgroup analysis. The minimum study requirementwas to ensure that there was adequate power to predict moderatorvariables that influenced effect size ( Borenstein et al., 2009 ).Publication bias was conducted by visual assessment of funnelplots. Funnel plots were only generated when /H1135010 samples wereThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.55 COGNITIVE DEFICITS FIRST-EPISODE DEPRESSIONincluded in the analysis, as recommended by Borenstein et al.(2009) . Egger\u2019s test was used to quantify the amount of publicationbias and was chosen as it is considered a more powerful test thanthe rank correlation method. In cases of bias, trim and fill analyseswere conducted to yield an unbiased estimate of the effect size(Lipsey & Wilson, 2001 ).Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis IISelection criteria. For the systematic review, inclusion crite-ria for studies were as follows: (a) use of sample diagnosed withMDD according to DSM\u2013III ,DSM\u2013III\u2013R ,DSM\u2013IV ,DSM\u2013IV\u2013TR ,DSM-5 , ICD-9, or ICD-10 criteria; (b) participants must not havepreviously been diagnosed with a major depressive episode; (c)participants were followed to remission using a repeated-measuresdesign; (d) used at least one objective cognitive test. The additionalcriterion for inclusion in the meta-analysis and the exclusioncriteria were the same as for the Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis I.Data extraction and recorded variables. Data extractionfollowed the same protocol as detailed for Systematic Review andMeta-Analysis I. From each study, the following were coded foreach independent sample: (a) number of FED patients, (b) cogni-tive tests administered, (c) MandSDof cognitive performance atbaseline and follow-up assessments, and (d) patient characteristics(gender, depression severity at baseline and follow-up, length oftime to follow-up, mean age, medication, current or remitteddepression, premorbid intelligence, age of onset, educational at-tainment, comorbidity, duration of FED).Meta-analysis. Standardized mean differences were calcu-lated as Cohen\u2019s dusing the formula M2\u2013M1/SDpooled , where M2is the mean, follow-up cognitive performance and M1is the mean,baseline cognitive performance in FED patients. SDpooled wasgiven by summing the baseline and follow-up SDs, and dividing by2. To calculate the variance of dfor each cognitive variable, thecorrelation between the baseline and follow-up performance isrequired. As this was not available in any of the included studies,a recommended global estimate of r/H11005.70 was applied to calculatethe variance of d,/H208491n/H11001d22n/H20850/H208512/H208491/H11002r/H20850/H20852, where nis the number ofFED patients ( Lipsey & Wilson, 2001 ). All effect sizes werecorrected for small sample bias using Hedges\u2019 gformula. Apositive gindicated that cognitive function improved at follow-upcompared with baseline.Inverse-variance weighted, random-effects models were appliedfor each analysis, considering the variability in cognitive testspooled under a common domain ( Borenstein et al., 2009 ). Theremaining conduct of the meta-analytic process was the same asdetailed above for Meta-Analysis I.ResultsSystematic Review IAfter deleting duplicates, 389 potentially relevant articles wereidentified from which 30 were included in the meta-analysis. Allarticles were published in English. Seventeen authors were con-tacted for additional cognitive data ( n/H1100510) or for subgroupanalysis of FED patients from a sample of first-episode, affectivedisorders ( n/H110057). Additional information was provided by fourauthors which allowed the inclusion of those studies in the anal-ysis; authors cited \u201ctoo busy to prioritize location of data\u201d ( n/H110054)as the main reason for not facilitating data requests. The reviewprocess is detailed in Figure 1 .Of the studies included, the majority were published in England(k/H110055), followed by China or U.S.A. ( k/H110054), then Norway ( k/H110053). France, Finland, Japan, Turkey, and The Netherlands eachpublished two studies ( k/H110052), and Germany, Belgium, Australia,Denmark, and Canada each published one study ( k/H110051). A total of994 patients (subsample size range 9\u201349) and 1471 healthy con-trols (sample size range 11\u201388) were included in the analysis. TheFED group consisted of 356 males (35.81%) and 586 females(58.95%); 52 participants (5.23%) had no gender reported. Theweighted, mean patient age was 27.40 years. The healthy controlgroup contained 556 males (37.80%) and 761 females (51.73%);gender was not specified for 154 participants (10.47%). Theweighted, mean control age was 29.99 years. For details of report-ing on each prespecified moderator variable refer to Table 1 .Eight studies reported data for two FED subsamples. Sub-samples included current and remitted FED patients ( k/H110054), orpsychotic and nonpsychotic FED patients ( k/H110054). An effect sizewas calculated for each FED subsample with respect to a single,healthy control group, with the exception of one study that com-pared each FED subsample to its own geographically matched,healthy control group. One study reported data for three FEDsubsamples (current, partial remission, and full remission) com-pared with a single, healthy control group. As the same controlgroup served as a comparison for more than one FED sample,effect sizes were not statistically independent ( Reis & Judd, 2014 ).However, this method was chosen as remission and psychosis wereintended to be explored as moderator variables which justifiedproviding a separate effect size for each subsample.For each study, and relevant subsamples, cognitive performanceplus coded variables are outlined in Table 1S in the supplementaryonline data. Forty-one standardized, cognitive tests were identi-fied; for details of tests and categorization into the relevant cog-nitive domain refer to Table 2 . A separate cognitive domain forreaction time (RT) was formed by pooling RTs from unstandard-ized tests of sustained attention ( k/H110054). However, not all reporteddata was meta-analyzable. Five study-level composite scores wereexcluded, as they pooled tests from different cognitive domains:the \u201cLearning and memory\u201d score from As et al. (2011) includedboth verbal and visual tests; while the following four compositescores were excluded from Hill, Keshavan, Thase, and Sweeney(2004) : \u201cAttention\u201d (pooled tests of processing speed and workingmemory), \u201cExecutive function\u201d (pooled tests of shifting and verbalfluency), \u201cVerbal memory\u201d and \u201cVisual memory\u201d (both pooledtests of learning and delayed).Only one study reported on reward-based, decision making(Yang et al., 2014 ) which meant that this cognitive domain couldnot be meta-analyzed. This study showed motivational deficits inFED patients relative to healthy controls, as well as an abnormalability to evaluate the probability and magnitude of expectedpay-offs. FED patients were not as willing to complete \u201chardtasks\u201d requiring 20 button-presses within 4 seconds with the non-dominant pinkie finger, for higher monetary rewards, comparedwith \u201ceasy tasks\u201d which required 10 button-presses with the dom-inant index finger within 4 seconds, but lower rewards.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.56 AHERN AND SEMKOVSKAIn addition, planning ability could not be meta-analyzed as datawas only reported by two studies which used different scoringsystems (CANTAB Stockings of Cambridge test, Maalouf et al.,2011 ; Tower of London test, Schmid & Hammar, 2013a ). Thesestudies did not obtain fully consistent results. Schmid and Hammar(2013a) observed no significant differences in planning betweenFED patients and controls. Similarly, Maalouf et al. (2011) did notfind a significant difference in planning between remitted FEDpatients and controls. However, a group-by-difficulty level inter-action was demonstrated where current FED patients performedFigure 1.

This indicatesthat for FED patients, planning may only be minimally impaired,and present only during the depressed state, with deficits emergingas a function of task complexity.Meta-Analysis ITable 3 details the weighted, mean effect sizes for cognitiveperformance in FED patients compared with healthy controls.Outlier screening resulted in the exclusion of three effect sizeswhich are detailed in the note to Table 3 . As a result of outlierscreening, cognitive status, assessed by the Mini Mental StateExamination, was no longer eligible for meta-analysis ( k/H110051).Nevertheless, results indicated that FED patients were impairedrelative to controls ( Maeshima et al., 2012 ).Processing speed. Data assessing processing speed was de-rived from four tests and a study-level composite score pooled intofour variables (see Table 2 ). Effect sizes ranged from nonsignifi-cant to large. FED patients did not perform any slower in number-coding tests compared with controls ( g/H110050.37, p/H11005.10), althoughresults between studies were largely heterogeneous, Q(7)/H1100536.06,p/H11021.00001, I2/H1100581%. Relative to controls, FED patients showeda small impairment in TMT-A ( g/H110050.42, p/H11005.004), a moderateimpairment in the processing speed composite score ( g/H110050.63,p/H11021.0001) and a large impairment in the Stroop test color namingand word reading conditions ( g/H110050.93, p/H11021.00001).Visuospatial attention. Data assessing visuospatial attentionwas derived from the Spatial Span Forward test reported by threestudies. FED patients showed a small impairment in visuospatialattention compared with controls ( g/H110050.32, p/H11005.02).Auditory attention. Data assessing auditory attention wasderived from the Digit Span Forward test reported by three studies.Relative to controls, FED patients showed a small impairment inauditory attention ( g/H110050.35, p/H11005.03).Sustained visual attention. Data for sustained visual atten-tion was provided by three tests which were pooled into twovariables. FED patients showed a small impairment in the sus-tained attention composite score ( g/H110050.43, p/H11005.003) but did notproduce significantly more errors than controls ( g/H110050.34, p/H11005.18).RT sustained visual attention. RT for sustained visual atten-tion was derived from unstandardized tests and pooled into threevariables. FED patients did not differ from controls in simple RT(g/H110050.11, p/H11005.59), complex tracking RT ( g/H11005/H11002 0.02, p/H11005.92),or the RT composite score ( g/H110050.06, p/H11005.78).Visuospatial working memory. Data assessing visuospatialworking memory was derived from six tests and a study-levelcomposite score pooled into two variables. Relative to controls,FED patients were moderately impaired on the visuospatial work-ing memory composite score ( g/H110050.74, p/H11005.005) and produceda significantly, larger number of errors ( g/H110051.05, p/H11021.00001).Auditory working memory. Data assessing auditory workingmemory was derived from two tests and pooled into two variables.FED patients showed a small impairment in the Digit Span Back-wards test ( g/H110050.33,p/H11005.02) and in the auditory working memorycomposite score ( g/H110050.39, p/H11021.0001) compared with controls.Autobiographical memory. Data assessing autobiographicalmemory, measured as the proportion of overgeneral memories,was derived from two studies. Relative to controls, FED patientsshowed a moderate impairment and produced more overgeneral,autobiographical memories in response to positive or negativewords ( g/H110050.69, p/H11021.0001). The results of a third study ( Nan-drino, Pezard, Poste, Reveillere, & Beaune, 2002 ) were not meta-analyzable as cognitive data were not available. However, resultswere partially consistent with that of the meta-analysis as FEDpatients produced a greater proportion of overgeneral memoriesfor positive, but not for negative cue words, relative to controls.Visual learning. Data for visual learning was derived fromtwo tests reported by five studies. Relative to controls, FEDpatients were moderately impaired in the Visual Reproduction Itest ( g/H110050.65, p/H11005.01) and in the visual learning composite score(g/H110050.64, p/H11005.001).Delayed visual memory. Data for delayed visual memorywas derived from four tests and pooled into two variables. FEDpatients demonstrated a small impairment in the delayed visualmemory composite score compared with controls ( g/H110050.39, p/H11005.01) and a moderate impairment in the Visual Reproduction II test(g/H110050.70, p/H11005.03). However, the overlap in confidence intervalsindicates that the true effect sizes may not be substantially differ-ent (composite score: 95% CI [0.08, 0.70]; Visual Reproduction IItest: 95% CI [0.07, 1.32]).Verbal memory recognition. Data for verbal memory recog-nition was pooled from three tests reported by three studies. FEDpatients did not show any impairment in verbal memory recogni-tion compared with controls ( g/H110050.37, p/H11005.15). Moderateheterogeneity between the studies, Q(3)/H110059.04, p/H11005.03,I2/H1100567%, likely explains the nonsignificant findings.Verbal learning. Data for verbal learning was derived fromfive tests which provided three variables. Effect sizes ranged fromnonsignificant to moderate. FED patients showed a trend toward asmall impairment in the verbal learning composite score ( g/H110050.31,p/H11005.05), however, as the confidence interval contained zero, it isassumed that no difference in the composite score exists betweenFED patients and controls (95% CI [0.00, 0.63]). Relative tocontrols, FED patients showed no impairment in word-list learning(g/H110050.11, p/H11005.54) but a moderate impairment in storytellingTable 1% Studies in Systematic Review I (k /H1100531) Reporting on EachModerator VariableModerator % StudiesPatient status (outpatient or inpatient) 93.55Remission status (current or remission) 100.00Mean age 96.77Medication (% patients) 87.10Depression severity 87.10Age of onseta22.58Axis I comorbiditya64.52Duration FEDa54.84Educational attainmenta54.84Premorbid IQa25.81Psychotic features (psychotic or non-psychotic)b22.58Note .

Data for delayed verbal memorywas derived from five tests which provided three variables. Effectsizes ranged from small to moderate. Relative to controls, FEDpatients showed a small impairment in the delayed verbal memorycomposite score ( g/H110050.43, p/H11021.0001) and in word-list memory(g/H110050.39, p/H11005.002), but a moderate impairment in storytellingmemory ( g/H110050.65, p/H11005.004).Reasoning. Data assessing reasoning was derived from thePicture Completion test reported by two studies. Relative to con-trols, FED patients showed a moderate impairment in reasoning(g/H110050.78, p/H11021.00001).Inhibition. Data assessing inhibition was derived fromthree cognitive tests. FED patients reported a moderate impair-ment in inhibition compared with healthy controls ( g/H110050.76,p/H11005.0005).Shifting. Data for shifting were derived from eight testspooled into six cognitive variables. Effect sizes ranged from smallto large. Relative to controls, FED patients showed small impair-ments in shifting between categories ( g/H110050.36, p/H11021.0001), thenumber of errors made ( g/H110050.43, p/H11005.0007), and trials needed forcompletion ( g/H110050.46, p/H11005.009). Moderate impairments wereobserved in the composite score ( g/H110050.51, p/H11021.00001) and in theamount of time required to complete the tasks ( g/H110050.57, p/H11021.00001). The largest impairments were shown in accuracy withFED patients making fewer correct responses relative to controls(g/H110050.82, p/H11005.001).Verbal fluency. Data assessing verbal fluency was derivedfrom five tests and a study-level composite score pooled into threevariables. Effect sizes ranged from small to moderate. Relative tocontrols, FED patients showed a small impairment in the letterfluency task ( g/H110050.48, p/H11021.0001), and were moderately impairedin semantic fluency ( g/H110050.79, p/H11021.00001) and in the verbalfluency composite score ( g/H110050.64, p/H11021.00001).Table 2 ( continued )Cognitive domain Cognitive tests/variables kn NShifting Categories 9 13 285-Pooled from WCST, MCST, and D-KEFS switching fluencyErrors 9 13 281-Pooled from WCST (perseverative, non-perseverative errors, no. errors),Cogtest Set-Shifting errors, ID-ED errors, Stroop Colour Word Testerrors, and TMT-B % interferenceTrials 5 6 172-Pooled from WCST (no. trials, no. trials to complete first category),ID-ED trials, and Penn Conditional Exclusion Task trialsCorrect responses 2 3 77-Pooled from WCST (correct responses, % conceptual level responses)Time 6 6 136-TMT-BComposite 16 21 480-Pooled from cognitive tests outlinedVerbal fluency Letter Fluency 6 6 121-Pooled from WAIS-R, D-KEFS, COWAT and LPS testSemantic Fluency 5 5 102-Pooled from WAIS-R, D-KEFS, COWAT and Supermarket testComposite 7 8 147-Pooled from cognitive tests outlined and study-level composite scoreMotor skills Composite 2 3 55-Pooled from study-level composite scores, and Cogtest Finger-TappingIntelligence Composite 10 16 426-Pooled from WAIS, WISC, Raven\u2019s Standard Progressive Matrices andRaven\u2019s Coloured Matrices A, B, ABNote .

A composite motor skills domain was derivedfrom the Cogtest finger-tapping test and a study-level compositescore. FED patients had a small motor impairment in comparisonto healthy controls ( g/H110050.39, p/H11005.02).Intelligence. Data assessing intelligence was derived fromfour tests. FED patients demonstrated a small impairment in in-telligence compared with controls ( g/H110050.26, p/H11005.005).Moderator analysis. Of the 40 cognitive variables analyzed,20 showed significant heterogeneity. Because of insufficient num-ber of studies, only five of the prespecified moderators could bemeta-analyzed to try and account for this unexplained heteroge-neity between studies (see Table 1 ).Remission. Subgroup analysis was possible for 17 variables.Remission (see Table 4 ) was associated with performance compa-rable to healthy controls on 15 of these variables. Remitted FEDpatients were less impaired than current FED patients and compa-rable to controls in number-coding ( p/H11005.007), TMT-A ( p/H11005.006),processing speed composite score ( p/H11021.0001), word-list learning(p/H11005.03), word-list delayed ( p/H11005.05), storytelling delayed ( p/H11005.02), delayed verbal memory composite score ( p/H11005.09), and IQ(p/H11005.05). Remitted FED patients were not less impaired thancurrent FED patients in autobiographical memory ( p/H11005.47), visuallearning composite ( p/H11005.34), Visual Reproduction II ( p/H11005.35),delayed visual memory ( p/H11005.47), verbal learning composite ( p/H11005.12), shifting errors ( p/H11005.75), or shifting composite ( p/H11005.55).However, remitted FED performed similar to controls as the con-fidence intervals of effect size for each of these variables crossedzero ( Borenstein et al., 2009 ).Patient status. Subgroup analysis was possible for 18 vari-ables. Inpatient status was significantly associated with more im-pairment in number-coding relative to outpatients ( p/H11005.0004; seeTable 5 ). No significant difference was observed in inpatientperformance compared with outpatients in any other variable ( p/H11022.10). However, as the confidence intervals crossed zero, it can beconcluded that inpatient performance was comparable to controlsin TMT-A, delayed visual memory composite, word-list learning,verbal learning composite, word-list delayed, delayed verbal mem-ory composite, shifting categories, errors, and IQ. Similarly, out-patient performance was comparable with healthy controls innumber-coding, TMT-A, processing speed composite, sustainedvisual attention composite, visual learning composite, delayedvisual memory composite, word-list learning, verbal learning com-posite, shifting time, and IQ.Age. Metaregression was possible for nine variables. Higherage at onset significantly predicted larger impairments in IQ ( b/H11005.03, z/H110052.77, p/H11005.006) but smaller impairments in word-listdelayed memory relative to controls ( b/H11005/H11002 .04, z/H11005/H11002 2.06, p/H11005.04). Age was not significantly associated with any other variable:for TMT-A, processing speed composite, verbal learning compos-ite, delayed verbal memory composite, shifting (categories, errors,and composite), all p/H11022.20.Medication (% patients). Metaregression was possible forsix variables: processing speed composite, verbal learning com-posite, delayed verbal memory composite, shifting (categories,errors, and composite). Medication was not significantly associ-ated with the extent of impairment in any of these cognitivevariables (all p/H11022.36).Depression severity. Where possible, depression severityscores were transformed to the Hamilton Rating Scale forDepression\u201317 items scale (HRSD-17) using formulae proposedbyHeo, Murphy, and Meyers (2007 ; HRSD-17 /H11005/H11002 1.58/H110010.86[MADRS score]) and Vittengl, Clark, Kraft, and Jarrett (2005 ;HRSD-17 /H110050.65/H110010.67 [BDI-II]). After transformation toHRSD-17 scores, sufficient data were available to perform metare-gressions on six variables: processing speed composite, verballearning composite, delayed verbal memory (word list delayed andcomposite), and shifting (categories and composite). Depressionseverity was not significantly associated with the extent of impair-ment in any cognitive variable (all p/H11022.18).Publication bias. Sufficient sample numbers ( n/H1135010) meantthat it was possible to analyze funnel plots for nine variables.Egger\u2019s test indicated a publication bias for studies reportinggreater impairment in the shifting composite variable relative tothe estimated, mean performance among FED patients (Egger\u2019sintercept /H110055.58, p/H11005.008). For visual presentation of publicationbias in the shifting composite variable, a funnel plot (standardizedmean difference between FED patients and healthy controls vs.standard error) is presented in Figure 2 . Trim and fill analysesrevealed that after controlling for publication bias and imputing theeffect sizes for six hypothetical, missing studies, the adjusted,weighted mean effect size was significant, although it indicated asmaller impairment in FED patients relative to healthy controls(g/H110050.27). All other Egger\u2019s tests were nonsignificant, pvaluerange .07 to .53.Systematic Review IIThe same articles returned from the database search, as outlinedin Part 1 of the review, were screened using the updated inclusionand exclusion criteria. Seven authors were contacted with requestsfor additional data of which four responded; one provided addi-tional descriptive statistics, two cited \u201ctoo busy to prioritize locat-ing data,\u201d and one author reported \u201cdata no longer available.\u201d Thereview process is detailed in Figure 3 .The included studies were published in Japan, France, Spain,and Norway ( k/H110051 published in each country). A total of 92 FEDpatients (subsample size range 5\u201330) were included in the review,consisting of 26 males (28.16%) and 32 females (34.78%); 34participants (36.96%) had no gender reported. The weighted meanpatient age was 40.29 years, with a weighted mean follow-upperiod of 17.68 months. For each study, and relevant subsamples,baseline and follow-up cognitive performance plus coded variablesare detailed in Table 2S in the supplementary online data.Because of insufficient number of studies, it was not possible tometa-analyze the data provided by two studies ( Maeshima et al.,2012 ;Nandrino et al., 2002 ).Maeshima and colleagues (2012)assessed visual and verbal learning and memory in remitted, FEDpatients. Results showed that impaired performance on the LogicalMemory and Visual Reproduction tests did not persist at follow-up(mean 3.2 years) and were comparable with the performance ofhealthy controls. Nandrino and colleagues (2002) evaluated thepercentage of overgeneral autobiographical memories producedfollowing remission of FED. They observed that, after a 28-dayinterval, FED patients produced less overgeneral memories, with acomplete normalization of function for negative autobiographicalmemories.Two studies ( Roca et al., 2015 ;Schmid & Hammar, 2013b )reported comparable data and thus were meta-analyzed.

Data assessing processing speed was de-rived from two tests pooled into two variables: TMT-A (time) andcomposite Stroop Color Word Test color naming and word readingconditions (time). At remission, FED patients showed a moderateimprovement in TMT-A compared with their baseline acute epi-sode performance, homogenous among the studies. There was nosignificant improvement observed on the Stroop composite, butlarge heterogeneity in findings was observed between the studies(I2/H1100585%).Inhibition. Data were derived from the Stroop inhibition(time) conditions. At remission, FED patients showed a small,nonsignificant improvement in inhibition compared with theirbaseline acute episode performance.Shifting. Data assessing shifting were derived from two testspooled into two variables: TMT-B (time) and Stroop interference/switching (time). At remission, FED patients showed a smallimprovement in TMT-B compared with their baseline acute epi-sode performance, homogenous among the studies. They alsoshowed a small, non significant improvement in Stroop interfer-ence/switching compared with their baseline acute episode perfor-mance, an outcome showing a small heterogeneity ( I2/H1100537%).Verbal fluency. Data assessing verbal fluency was derivedfrom two tests pooled into two variables: Letter Fluency andSemantic Fluency. Both showed negligible, nonsignificant im-provement following remission of a FED relative to the verbalfluency.Moderator analysis and publication bias. The TMT-A,TMT-B, and Letter fluency variables showed homogenous out-comes, while the remaining four variables showed small to largeheterogeneity. Moderator and publication bias analyses were notconducted due to insufficient number of samples.DiscussionThis systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted todetermine the pattern and extent of cognitive impairment in theFED. In addition, we sought to determine how certain moderatorsinfluenced the extent of impairment, and finally, to explorewhether the observed impairment persisted, or was present onlyduring the depressive episode.The Pattern and Extent of Cognitive ImpairmentFED patients displayed a broad range of impairment acrosscognitive domains. Relative to healthy controls, no significantimpairment was observed in number-coding speed, errors and RTfor sustained visual attention, verbal memory recognition, or word-list learning. In general, small impairments were noted in thecomposite scores for visuospatial, auditory and sustained visualattention, auditory working memory, delayed visual memory, ver-bal learning composite, delayed verbal memory, motor skills, andIQ. Moderate impairment was observed in processing speed, visu-ospatial working memory, autobiographical memory, visual learn-ing, storytelling learning, reasoning, inhibition, shifting, and verbalfluency. Large impairments were shown in the Stroop color nam-ing and word reading speed, visuospatial working memory errors,and shifting correct responses. The extent of impairment wasassociated with remission, patient status, and age. Remitted FEDpatients were comparable with controls in processing speed, learn-ing and memory (both verbal and visual), autobiographical mem-ory, shifting, and IQ. Inpatient status did not contribute explainingthe heterogeneity in observed results. Increasing mean patient agewas associated with more impairment in IQ, but less impairment inword-list delayed memory relative to controls. A very small num-ber of studies ( n/H110054) of cognitive function followed FED patientsuntil remission. They showed moderate improvement in process-ing speed and a small improvement in shifting between over-learned sequences (TMT-B), but a persistent impairment in Stroopcolor naming and word reading speed, inhibition, shifting betweeneffortful and automatic processing (Stroop Switching) and verbalfluency (both letter and semantic).Overall, our findings are fairly consistent with the only meta-analysis of cognitive function in FED to date ( Lee, Hermens,Porter, & Redoblado-Hodge, 2012 ). Similar levels of impairmentin processing speed, attention, visual learning and memory, andshifting were shown. Our findings of small to large impairmentsacross working memory and verbal learning and memory, how-ever, were not observed in the Lee et al. (2012) meta-analysis.Although, as only 13 studies were included, it is likely that Lee\u2019smeta-analysis might have been underpowered to detect significantdifferences in performance ( Borenstein et al., 2009 ). Impairment inworking memory and verbal learning and memory have beenreported in recurrent, MDD patients ( Rock et al., 2014 ;Wagner etal., 2015 ), with a similar extent of impairment to that observed inthe present meta-analysis.Table 4 ( continued )Variable kn N g95% CIQw Qb p LL ULIQ compositeCurrent 10 12 328 .35 .13 .57 22.43Remission 3 4 98 /H11002.01 /H11002.28 .27 .56 3.98 .05Note .C I/H11005confidence interval; g/H11005Hedges\u2019 geffect size; k/H11005number of studies; n/H11005number of patient samples; N/H11005number of patients; LL/H11005lowerlimit; p/H11005significance level; Qb/H11005between-group heterogeneity; Qw/H11005within-group heterogeneity; TMT-A /H11005Trail Making Test-A; UL/H11005upper limit.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.64 AHERN AND SEMKOVSKATable 5Inpatient Status Subgroup Analysis of VarianceVariable kn N g95% CIQw Qb p LL ULProcessing speedNumber-codingOutpatient 2 4 76 /H11002.18 /H11002.46 .10 .60Inpatient 3 4 112 .91 .38 1.44 11.28 12.52 .0004TMT-AOutpatient 4 6 126 .31 /H11002.06 .69 12.79Inpatient 3 3 76 .49 /H11002.06 1.04 6.02 .27 .61CompositeOutpatient 5 7 147 .42 /H11002.03 .87 24.62Inpatient 4 5 133 .70 .23 1.18 16.2 .73 .39Sustained visual attentionCompositeOutpatient 4 5 118 .34 /H11002.04 .71 7.82Inpatient 2 2 31 .66 .23 1.09 .29 1.24 .27Visual learningCompositeOutpatient 3 3 67 .66 /H11002.04 1.36 9.16Inpatient 2 2 31 .63 .20 1.06 .00 .00 .95Delayed visual memoryCompositeOutpatient 5 7 147 .39 /H11002.01 .78 19.84Inpatient 2 2 31 .41 /H11002.02 .83 .11 .01 .94Verbal learningWord-listOutpatient 3 5 97 /H11002.14 /H11002.40 .12 3.29Inpatient 2 2 44 .33 /H11002.56 1.22 6.36 .99 .32CompositeOutpatient 6 8 164 .16 /H11002.20 .52 22.70Inpatient 3 3 54 .51 /H11002.19 1.21 9.10 .76 .38Delayed verbal memoryWord-listOutpatient 5 7 116 .29 .03 .54 8.96Inpatient 3 3 54 .53 /H11002.08 1.14 6.9 .51 .47CompositeOutpatient 8 10 183 .36 .14 .59 15.64Inpatient 3 3 54 .52 /H11002.08 1.12 6.66 .22 .64Verbal fluencyLetter fluencyOutpatient 4 4 90 .46 .17 .75 1.10Inpatient 2 2 31 .51 .09 .94 .83 .03 .85Semantic fluencyOutpatient 3 3 71 .85 .50 1.19 1.12Inpatient 2 2 31 .70 .27 1.13 .81 .28 .60CompositeOutpatient 4 4 116 .63 .34 .92 .79Inpatient 2 2 31 .63 .21 1.06 .54 .00 .99ShiftingCategoriesOutpatient 5 7 147 .40 .19 .62 .95Inpatient 4 6 138 .33 /H11002.05 .71 13.9 .11 .74ErrorsOutpatient 5 7 145 .44 .12 .75 12.77Inpatient 4 6 136 .41 /H11002.02 .85 16.73 .01 .93Time(table continues )This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.65 COGNITIVE DEFICITS FIRST-EPISODE DEPRESSIONThe present meta-analysis did not, however, replicate the asso-ciation between medication and cognitive performance. Lee et al.(2012) found antidepressants to be associated with poorer verballearning and memory, but improved shifting in FED patients.Nevertheless, their findings must be interpreted with caution asregression analysis was conducted on fewer than the recommended10 samples (shifting, n/H110057;Borenstein et al., 2009 ), and they useda more liberal alpha level of .10 to determine significance. In linewith our findings, Hasselbalch, Knorr, and Kessing (2011) notedthat the association between medication and cognitive function isnot clearly established. This owes to the fact that it is difficult toparse the direct effects of medication from other clinical, patientcharacteristics such as depression severity or the number of pastepisodes. Therefore, independent of past episodes, it is possiblethat the extent of impairment is not significantly associated withmedication in FED patients.Likewise, our findings showed that inpatient status was notassociated with a significantly impaired performance in most cog-nitive domains relative to healthy controls. This is inconsistentwith the results of Porter et al. (2007) , who noted larger cognitiveimpairment in recurrent, MDD inpatients relative to outpatients.However, the authors acknowledged that the length and number ofpast episodes likely explains why MDD patients are hospitalizedand therefore, some extent of the impairment among inpatients.Notwithstanding, Lee et al. (2012) observed greater impairmentsin FED inpatients relative to outpatients. Yet, their sample were onaverage older ( M/H1100539.36 years) than the sample in the currentreview ( M/H1100527.40 years). Therefore, it is likely that differences inthe extent of impairment observed in FED inpatients in eachmeta-analysis could be attributed to age differences between thepatient samples. Taken together, a broad pattern of cognitiveimpairment is observed from the FED but consideration must bepaid to patient characteristics and how this influences the extent ofimpairment experienced by patients.Persistence of Impairment at the FED: State, Scar, orTrait Markers?Importantly, the persistence of impairment at the FED must bedetermined, considering that this has been identified as a vulner-ability for recurrence, as well as a key determinant of functionalrecovery ( Bortolato et al., 2016 ). In the present meta-analysis,processing speed and memory showed a normalization of functionwith remission, consistent with previous reviews ( Douglas & Por-ter, 2009 ;Lee et al., 2012 ). Additionally, we demonstrated thatlearning, autobiographical memory, shifting, and IQ were restoredto normal levels of function with remission. Impairment in thesedomains therefore likely represents state markers.Moreover, normalization in performance observed in shiftingsuggests that executive function is somewhat sensitive to thedepressive state at the FED. Nevertheless, a caveat of tests mea-suring executive function is that they are overly reliant on timemeasures and processing speed ( Lezak et al., 2012 ). As discussed,processing speed normalizes with remission, so it could equally beargued that improvement in executive function is explained byimproved processing speed ( Nebes et al., 2000 ). However, FEDpatients showed a persistent impairment in the Stroop color nam-ing and word reading processing speed condition ( g/H110050.11, p/H11005Table 5 ( continued )Variable kn N g95% CIQw Qb p LL ULOutpatient 2 2 50 .67 /H11002.06 1.39 2.86Inpatient 3 3 76 .55 .25 .85 1.96 .09 .77CompositeOutpatient 8 10 240 .40 .19 .62 14.46Inpatient 6 8 204 .37 .09 .65 15.16 .04 .85IntelligenceIQ compositeOutpatient 8 12 343 .12 /H11002.03 .27 6.93Inpatient 1 2 57 .72 /H11002.30 1.75 7.45 1.30 .25Note .C I/H11005confidence interval; g/H11005Hedges\u2019 geffect size; k/H11005number of studies; n/H11005number of patient samples; N/H11005number of patients; LL/H11005lowerlimit; p/H11005significance level; Qb/H11005between-group heterogeneity; Qw/H11005within-group heterogeneity; TMT-A /H11005Trail Making test-A; UL/H11005upper limit.Figure 2.

Thus, processing speed alone could not account for theimprovement in shifting. However, larger improvements in theprocessing speed condition of the Trail Making Test-A ( g/H110050.68)were observed relative to small improvements in the timed, shift-ing condition of the Trail Making Test-B ( g/H110050.45), suggestingthat speed was associated with subsequent shifting improvement. Itis possible to argue, given these results, that the \u201cless effortful\u201dshifting between overlearned sequences (alphabet; counting forTMT-B) is improved following the processing speed normaliza-tion observed in remission, whereas the \u201cmore effortful\u201d shiftingbetween reading and inhibiting of reading (Stroop Switching) doesnot beneficiate from this normalization and stays impaired.

Yet, as the majority of research has beenconducted on recurrent patients, and not determined whether im-pairment predated the FED, the possibility of scarring effectscannot be ruled out ( Hasselbalch et al., 2011 ). Considering ourfindings of improvement in shifting upon remission, it is possiblethat persistence of executive function is a result of recurrentepisodes which contribute additional impairment, overall leadingto maintenance of the impairment. This assumes the scar hypoth-esis ( Kessing, 1998 ). However, it remains to be determinedwhether the FED is sufficient to ensure persistence. Consideringsmall improvements in inhibition were shown in FED patients atremission ( g/H110050.33) relative to moderate impairment during thecurrent state compared with healthy controls ( g/H110050.76), it can bespeculated that impaired inhibition remained residually as a scar ofthe FED. Yet, as it was not possible to compare inhibition inremitted FED patients to healthy controls, the probability of com-plete normalization of function at the FED cannot be ruled out.Verbal fluency was the only executive function that persisted at astable level of impairment, consistent with trait-qualities. Again,however, it is inconclusive whether persistence in verbal fluencyrepresents a trait marker, or possibly a scar, unless the impairmentwas observed to predate the FED.For the most part, the majority of cognitive domains in the FEDappear to have state-like qualities, normalizing with remission.Persistence of deficits in verbal fluency, and likely residual per-sistence of deficits in inhibition, requires additional research todetermine the exact nature as either a trait, or scarring consequenceof the FED.LimitationsThis meta-analysis, however, is not without limitations. First,possible bias for any meta-analysis is that a comprehensive searchof published material was not completed. Funnel plots revealedthat studies with small patient samples, that reported nonsignifi-cant differences in shifting in FED patients compared with con-trols, were likely to not be published. As it was not possible toproduce funnel plots for all cognitive domains, it cannot be con-firmed whether publication bias accounted for some degree ofimpairment in FED patients, if there is a tendency to not publishstudies which show little or no impairment ( Borenstein et al.,2009 ).Second, considering the significant heterogeneity of 21 cogni-tive variables included in the two parts of the meta-analysis (seeTables 3 and6), it is apparent that the studies varied largely in thecharacteristics of the patients assessed, or the methods used. How-ever, insufficient study numbers meant that possible moderators(e.g., length of depressive episode) could not be assessed to de-termine how they influenced the extent of cognitive impairment.Moreover, previous reviews have suggested that depression sever-ity is associated with cognitive impairment in MDD ( McDermott& Ebmeier, 2009 ). However, the variance in depression severityscales used in the studies meant that some data could not betranslated into a HRSD-17 score to be included in the analysis.Otherwise, this may have allowed for more power to detect asignificant effect.Third, it would be important to determine whether differentcognitive profiles are associated with subtypes of depression.Seven psychotic samples were included in the analysis, yet aninsufficient number of studies meant that subgroup analysis couldnot be conducted. Study-level results, however, showed a trend ofmore severe impairment in executive function ( Ilonen et al., 2000 ;Taiminen et al., 2000 ), memory and visuospatial attention ( Hill,Keshavan, Thase, & Sweeney, 2004 ) in psychotic, FED patientscompared with nonpsychotic, FED patients.Future Directions and ConclusionOur findings have shown that cognitive function is impaired atthe FED in a broad range of cognitive domains. However, there islittle evidence in FED patients for several cognitive domainsknown to be affected during recurrent episodes, for example,planning ( Snyder, 2013 ).

Rock et al.(2014) demonstrated small to moderate impairment in unmedi-cated, recurrent MDD patients relative to healthy controls in at-tention, memory, and executive function. Yet, as only 33.33% ofthe samples included in this meta-analysis were unmedicated,research on unmedicated patient samples would be necessary todetermine the true pattern of impairment at the FED.Above all, research on cognitive impairment in MDD requiresadditional, longitudinal assessment of FED patients. This is nec-essary to better understand the relationship between cognitiveimpairment and the course of MDD from the FED. The presentreview showed that only 4 studies followed FED into remissionwhile collecting both acute episode and postepisode cognitive data.Thus the persistence of FED-associated deficits could be assessedonly for processing speed and some components of executivefunction. Specifically, longitudinal assessment would help to es-tablish if persistence, as observed in recurrent patients in domainssuch as attention and inhibition ( Bora et al., 2013 ), develops as ascar of recurrent, depressive episodes.The implications of our findings for clinical practice, however,highlight the importance of treating cognitive impairment in FEDpatients. It is suggested that emphasis must be placed on a \u201ccog-nitive remission\u201d to achieve a full, functional recovery from MDD(Bortolato et al., 2016 ). The authors outlined that this involvestreating the cognitive impairment, alongside mood symptoms, tonegate the likelihood of persistence, even residually, when moodhas been restored. As our analysis has evidenced, verbal fluency,and likely inhibition, show already persistent deficits following theFED. Therefore, cognitive interventions that may help to maintaincognitive function, and/or negate the possibility of persistenceshould be implemented into clinical practice right from onset ofthe FED. Computerized cognitive remediation, which uses cogni-tive exercises to activate neural networks within the brain thatrelate to specific cognitive abilities, has shown much promise inrestoring cognitive function ( Porter, Bowie, Jordan, & Malhi,2013 ). Although research on this intervention is limited, a recentmeta-analysis showed moderate to large improvements in attentionand working memory, with small to large improvements transfer-rable to global everyday functioning in MDD patients ( Motter etal., 2016 ).In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis demon-strated that, even from the FED, there are small to large impair-ments in a range of cognitive abilities. For the most part, cognitiveimpairment showed state-like qualities, normalizing with remis-sion. However, some persistence was already observed from theFED, with additional persistence in executive function possiblyemerging as a scar of subsequent, depressive episodes. Longitudi-nal assessment of FED patients is required to further explore therelationship between cognitive deficits persistence and the courseof MDD. Yet, as the persistence of impairment is of clinicalimportance for functional recovery, this meta-analysis highlightsthe need for interventions to treat cognitive impairment, alongsidedepressed mood symptoms, to promote functional recovery rightfrom the FED.References/H11569Indicates references included in the systematic review and meta-analysis (see supplemental online data)./H11569As, M., Dazzan, P., Fisher, H.
