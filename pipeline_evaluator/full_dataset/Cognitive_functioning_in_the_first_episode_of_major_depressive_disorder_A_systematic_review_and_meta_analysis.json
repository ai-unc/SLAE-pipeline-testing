Yet, when these deficits\nemerge and how they relate to the depressed state is unclear. The aim of this 2-part systematic review\nand meta-analysis is to determine the pattern and extent of cognitive deficits during a first-episode of\ndepression (FED) and their persistence following FED remission. Method: Published, peer-reviewed\narticles on cognitive function in FED patients through October 2015 were searched. Meta-analyses with\nrandom-effects modeling were conducted. Part 1 assessed weighted, mean effect sizes of cognitive\nfunction in FED patients relative to healthy controls. Moderator analyses of clinical and demographical\nvariables effects were conducted. Part 2 assessed weighted, mean effect sizes of change in cognitive\nfunction at remission compared with acute FED performance in longitudinal studies. Results: Thirty-one\nstudies including 994 FED patients were retained in Part 1. Relative to healthy controls, small to large\nimpairments were observed across most cognitive domains. Remission was associated with a normal-\nization of function in processing speed, learning and memory, autobiographical memory, shifting, and IQ.\nLower FED age was associated with higher IQ, but more impairment in word-list delayed memory. Four\nstudies including 92 FED patients were retained in Part 2. Following remission, FED patients showed\nsmall improvements in processing speed and shifting but persistent impairment in inhibition and verbal\nfluency. Conclusion: Significant cognitive deficits are already identifiable during a FED, with some\nfunctions showing persistent impairment upon remission. Clinicians must consider cognitive impairment\nalongside mood symptoms to ensure functional recovery from the FED,\n\nKeywords: cognitive deficits, first-episode of depression, meta-analysis, remission, systematic review\n\nSupplemental materials: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/neu0000319.supp\n\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder charac-\nterized by a profound state of sadness, or loss of interest in\nactivities, for at least a 2-week duration. This is accompanied by a\n‘minimum of five symptoms affecting behavior (disturbed sleep,\nchanges in appetite or weight, fatigue, slowed movement) and/or\ncognition (feelings of guilt, worthlessness, thoughts of death, dif-\nficulty in concentration or indecisiveness; American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2013). Typically, MDD is considered an episodic\ndisorder consisting of one or more depressive episodes; an episode\nis defined by a minimum 2-week period, accompanied by five of\nthe above-described symptoms, with a distinct onset and offset\n(Dubovsky & Dubovsky, 2002). MDD is one of the most prevalent\nof all mental disorders with an estimated 13.5% to 21.2% of the\npopulation experiencing at least one episode of depression (Kes-\nsler & Walters, 1998). However, recurrent depressive episodes are\nlikely in MDD with up to 80% experiencing more than one episode\nin their lifetime (Mueller et al., 1999).\n\n‘This article was published Online First October 10, 2016.\nElayne Ahern and Maria Semkovska, Department of Psychology, Uni-\nversity of Limerick.\nCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to Maria\nSemkovska, Department of Psychology, office E1-033 University of Lim-\nerick, Castletroy, Co Limerick Ireland.

While difficulties with concentration and making decisions\nhave been included as diagnostic criteria for MDD (American\nPsychiatric Association, 2013), cognitive deficits in processing\nspeed, attention, learning abilities, long-term memory, autobio-\ngraphical memory, and executive function have also been demon-\nstrated by numerous studies, reviews and meta-analyses. For ex-\nample, a meta-analysis of 24 studies, including 784 MDD patients,\nquantified moderate cognitive deficits in executive function, mem-\nory and attention relative to healthy controls (Rock, Roiser, Riedel,\n& Blackwell, 2014). Moreover, another meta-analysis of 113 stud-\nies focusing on executive functioning and including 3396 MDD\npatients (Snyder, 2013), showed large impairment in inhibition,\nand moderate impairment in shifting, verbal working memory,\nvisuospatial working memory, and verbal fluency.\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that cognitive impairment in MDD is\na key determinant of individual functional outcomes. It has been\nshown to persist following depression remission (Hasselbalch,\nKnorr, & Kessing, 2011), worsen with repeated depressive epi-\nsodes (Gorwood, Corruble, Falissard, & Goodwin, 2008; Kessing,\n\n\n\nis intended so\n\ng\n\nCOGNITIVE DEFICITS FIRST-EPISODE DEPRESSION 53\n\n1998; Vanderhasselt & De Raedt, 2009), and be a significant\npredictor of relapse (Reppermund, Ising, Lucae, & Zihl, 2009).\nCognitive deficits have been related to difficulties in maintaining\njob performance which can demand the ability to make decisions\nor sustain attention (Papazacharias & Nardini, 2012). Moreover,\ndifficulties with social functioning are also linked to cognitive\ndysfunction in depression (Withall, Harris, & Cumming, 2009).\n\nLost work productivity has been central to MDD-related societal\ncosts (Evans et al., 2013) alongside the direct health care costs\ninvolved in treating MDD (Ekman, Granstrém, Omérov, Jacob, &\nLandén, 2013). Even following the remission of mood symptoms,\nbaseline levels of daily functioning are not always restored. Recent\naccounts have suggested that the persistence of cognitive impair-\n‘ment following depression remission might contribute to compro-\nmise a full, functional recovery (Bortolato et al., 2016). Further-\n‘more, it has been suggested that cognitive remission should be now\nconsidered as a therapeutic target to restore functioning and pre-\nvent relapse (Bortolato et al., 2016; Lee, Hermens, Porter, &\nRedoblado-Hodge, 2012; Rock et al., 2014; Wekking, Bockting,\nKoeter, & Schene, 2012).\n\nRelation Between Course of MDD and Cognitive\nImpairment\n\nCognitive impairment in MDD has usually been studied in terms\nof how it relates to the course of the illness, namely during an acute\nepisode, following remission, in chronic depression, or in recurrent\ndepression (Hammar & Ardal, 2009). Remission refers to a period\nof minimal depressed symptoms experienced by the patient fol-\nlowing a depressive episode (Zimmerman et al., 2006). It has been\nsuggested that cognitive impairment is a state marker and second-\nary to depressed mood symptoms, that is, impairment is present\nonly during the depressive episode and normalizes thereafter with\nremission. However, recent studies have demonstrated its persis-\ntence following remission. In a review of 11 studies on 500\nremitted MDD patients, Hasselbalch and colleagues (2011) docu-\n‘mented persistent impairment in attention, memory, and executive\nfunction relative to healthy controls. Following from this, a meta-\nanalysis including 27 studies and 895 remitted, MDD patients\nquantified the impairment as moderate to large with most cognitive\ndomains, but specifically the executive function of inhibition,\nshowing persistent deficits (Bora, Harrison, Yucel, & Pantelis,\n2013).\n\nPersistence of deficits following a depressive episode can be\nindicative of either an impairment present before even a first-\nepisode of depression (FED) or adverse consequence of depres-\nsion. The trait marker hypothesis suggests that cognitive deficits\nrepresent a stable, underlying vulnerability for the onset of FED, or\nsubsequent recurrent episodes. Trait markers specifically exist\nbefore the FED, and show stable persistence throughout and into\nremission (Rohde, Lewinsohn, & Seeley, 1990). Population-based\nstudies have suggested that poorer episodic memory is a trait\nmarker which predicts the onset of the FED (Airaksinen, Wahlin,\nForsell, & Larsson, 2007). Moreover, a 9-year longitudinal study\nidentified impairment in attention and executive function as trait\nmarkers which predicted onset in healthy twins at high-risk to\ndevelop an affective disorder (Vinberg, Miskowiak, & Kessing,\n2013).\n\nAlternatively, the scar hypothesis proposes that cognitive im-\npairment develops during the FED and persists as a consequence\nor scar of the depressive episode, although the cognitive impair-\nment may only be residual (Lewinsohn, Steinmetz, Larson, &\nFranklin, 1981). This is related to neural changes that occur during\nthe depressive episode, subsequently affecting cognitive function.\nKessing (1998) demonstrated that each depressive episode was\nassociated with greater cognitive impairment in remitted, recurrent\nMDD patients relative to remitted FED patients, or healthy con-\ntrols. FED patients were not significantly different from controls.\nSimilarly, in a sample of 1895 MDD tested during an episode and\nafter remission, Gorwood and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that\nthe delayed verbal memory abilities progressively decrease after\neach consecutive depressive episode, despite patients having\nachieved remission. Research, however, has been inconsistent,\nwith sometimes no added impairment observed as a result of each\ndepressive episode (c.g., Wekking et al., 2012).\n\nTn summary, conclusive profiles characterizing cognitive im-\npairment that is state-, trait-, or recurrence-related have not been\ndetermined, yet there is a recognition that cognitive deficits should\nbe addressed conjointly with the mood episode and early in the\ncourse of MDD occurrence. Which cognitive functions should be\ntreated early remains debatable.\n\nHeterogeneity in MDD Cognitive Research and FED\nCognitive Profile\n\nMuch of the inconsistencies in cognitive research in MDD relate\nto differences in the patients assessed. Individual characteristics\nare likely to moderate the extent of cognitive impairment, that is,\ncertain characteristics determine whether more or less cognitive\nimpairment is associated with MDD (Hammar & Ardal, 2009).\nModerator variables including female gender (Postma, Jager, Kes-\nsels, Koppeschaar, & van Honk, 2004), lower premorbid intelli-\ngence, educational attainment (Plassman et al., 1995), older age\n(Deary et al., 2009), medication, inpatient status, younger age of\ndepression-onset, higher depression severity, comorbidity, psy-\nchotic features, number of past episodes, and length of these\nepisodes have all been associated with greater cognitive impair-\nment (for review see Porter, Bourke, & Gallagher, 2007).\n\nNotwithstanding the association between the number of epi-\nsodes and extent of impairment, the majority of research in MDD\nhas focused on samples with recurrent, depressive episodes (Ham-\nmar & Ardal, 2009). To disentangle the above-described complex-\nities in cognitive impairment MDD research relative to the state,\ntrait, and scar debate, it would be essential to start with describing\nthe cognitive profile associated with the state of FED. To the best\nof our knowledge, only one meta-analysis of cognitive function in\nthe FED has been conducted, but limited to an adult population.\nAcross 13 studies including 644 FED patients, small to moderate\ndeficits were observed in processing speed, attention, visual learn-\ning and memory, shifting, verbal fluency, and cognitive flexibility\n(Lee et al., 2012). Following moderator analyses, including remis-\nsion status, the authors concluded that disturbances in psychomo-\ntor speed and memory functioning were probably state-related,\nwhereas deficits in attention and executive function would be a\nMDD trait-marker.\n\nLee and colleagues’ meta-analysis (2012) was the first to dem-\nonstrate cognitive impairment in adult FED, a critical advance in\n\n\n54 AHERN AND SEMKOVSKA\n\nneuropsychological MDD research. Nevertheless, their conclu-\nsions relative to the impairment severity within the different cog-\nnitive domains and relative to the trait/state debate could be\nquestioned, given the study’s methodological limitations in terms\nof sample selection and choice of assessment for depression se-\nverity. First, the meta-analyses included mixed samples with 62%\nof the reviewed studies having samples containing both FED and\nrecurrent MDD. The inclusion of mixed samples might have led to\nan overestimation of FED-related cognitive impairment. For ex-\nample, the meta-analyzed study of Reppermund and colleagues\n(2009) included 16 patients with FED and 37 with recurrent MDD,\nwhile results from the whole sample of 53 were meta-analyzed.\nSecond, Lee and colleagues (2012) excluded samples where the\nindividuals’ mean age was “below 18. . .and primarily (greater\nthan 50%) younger than 16,” which limits the representativeness of\nthe meta-analyzed samples. Indeed, previous research suggests\nthat about 75% of all MDD patients have had their first FED\nbetween the ages of 11 and 15 (Kovacs et al, 1984; Lewinsohn,\nHops, Roberts, Seeley, & Andrews, 1993). Also, a recent meta-\nanalysis of 17 studies, including 447 children and adolescents with\nMDD, showed that moderate impairments are evident in attention,\nverbal memory, inhibition, and verbal fluency among this popu-\nlation relative to controls (Wagner, Miiller, Helmreich, Huss, &\nTadic, 2015). Third, as the authors report, their inclusion of sam-\nples with mean age up to 65 probably has increased the risk of\nhaving included people with vascular pathologies that also impact\non cognitive function (Lee et al., 2012). Finally, the authors\ndichotomized the moderator variable of depression severity into\n“euthymic” (= no symptoms) and “symptomatic” (= mild or\ngreater symptoms). This dichotomization prevents the assessment\nof the effect of depression severity on the observed outcomes.\nIndeed, greater depression severity has been associated with larger\ncognitive impairments (McDermott & Ebmeier, 2009).\n\nTo advance the debate of state/trait characteristic of cognitive\nimpairment in depression, an updated meta-analysis to describe the\ncognitive profile of FED, which addresses the above-described\nlimitations, is needed. Thus, the aims of the present systematic\nreview and meta-analysis are: (a) to determine the pattern and\nprovide a quantitative estimate of the extent of cognitive deficits in\nFED patients compared with healthy controls; (b) to examine the\ncontribution of moderator variables to the extent of this cognitive\nimpairment; and (c) to explore the persistence of cognitive impair-\n‘ment following FED remission. For the purpose of this review and\n‘meta-analysis, cognitive impairment refers to a level of function-\ning below that of the healthy, normal population that interferes\nwith daily life (Lezak et al., 2012).\n\nMethod\n\nA two-part systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted.\nPart 1 of the meta-analysis examined cognitive function in FED\npatients relative to healthy controls. Part 2 reviewed studies that\nfollowed FED in remission to further explore the persistence of\nthese cognitive deficits. The repeated assessment of FED patients\nis considered a more valid measure of persistence as patients are\ncompared with their own baseline performance, eliminating the\npossibility of individual differences when remitted FED patients\nare compared with healthy controls (Douglas & Porter, 2009).\n\nPRISMA guidelines for conducting and reporting systematic\nreviews and meta-analyses were followed (Moher, Liberati, Tet-\nZaff, & Altman, 2009).\n\nSearch Strategy\n\nThe electronic databases PsycINFO, PsycArticles, MEDLINE,\nEmbase, and PubMed were searched from the year 1980 to Octo-\nber 2015. The year 1980 was selected as this was when the term\n“major depressive disorder” was introduced to the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition (DSM-III;\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, 1980) and for the most part,\ndiagnostic criteria has remained the same since (Uher, Payne,\nPavlova, & Perlis, 2014). The following search terms were used\n“first depressive episode” OR (“first episode” OR “single episode”\nAND [“major depressive disorder” OR “major depressive epi-\nsode”]) AND (neurocognit™ OR cognit” OR neuropsycholog” OR\n“executive function” OR attention OR memory OR orientation\nOR perception OR language OR verbal OR visual OR reasoning\nOR vigilance OR visuospatial OR “problem solving” OR “pro-\ncessing speed” OR intelligence OR impairment). References from\nrelevant reviews and articles returned from the databases were\nhand-searched to identify additional studies. Only published stud-\nies were searched. For the purpose of this systematic review, a\nstudy was defined as an article which did not share the same\nsample and cognitive tests with any other article. In cases of\nredundancy, the most recent study with the largest sample size was\nretained to ensure statistical independence of effect sizes (Lipsey\n& Wilson, 2001).\n\nSystematic Review and Meta-Analysis I\n\nSelection criteria. For the systematic review, inclusion crite-\nria for studies were as follows: (a) use of sample diagnosed with\nMDD according to DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR,\nDSM-5, ICD-9, or ICD-10 criteria; (b) participants must not have\npreviously been diagnosed with a major depressive episode; (c)\ninclusion of a healthy, control comparison group; (d) Used at least\none objective cognitive test. Furthermore, for the meta-analysis, an\nadditional criterion required that the study reported means and\nstandard deviations of cognitive function in both FED patients and\ncontrols, or sufficient statistical data such as F or t statistics which\ncould be converted into effect sizes. Exclusion criteria were (a)\n‘mean age of the study sample =55 years, (b) redundant reports,\nthat is, separately published studies that have used the same\ncognitive tests on the same patient sample, (c) case series.\n\nData extraction and recorded variables. Titles and abstracts\nreturned from the database search were screened for potential\ninclusion against the selection criteria. Authors EA and MS\nsearched independently the selected databases using the above-\ndescribed search strategy and identified independently potentially\neligible studies. Their interrater agreement for studies’ inclusion/\nexclusion categorization was 0.98. Potentially eligible articles (in-\ncluding the few that only EA or only MS identified) were retained\nand full-texts located. The corresponding author was contacted if\nthe full-text of a potentially eligible article could not be located.\n‘When sufficient detail was not reported, but articles met the\nremaining inclusion criteria, a request for the missing information\nwas sent to the corresponding author. Authors who did not initially\nrespond were recontacted twice further.\n\n\nCOGNITIVE DEFICITS FIRST-EPISODE DEPRESSION 55\n\nCognitive tests were categorized into 12 standard cognitive do-\n‘mains (Lezak et al., 2012) also used in prior meta-analyses of cogni-\ntive function in MDD (Lee et al, 2012; Snyder, 2013). A cognitive\ndomain was defined as a class of cognitive functions which could be\nassessed using one or numerous, different cognitive tests (Lezak et al.,\n2012). As per standard categorizations, cognitive tests that used a\nsimilar methodology to assess cognitive function were pooled to-\ngether within the cognitive domain, for example, the Rey Auditory\nVerbal Learning Test and the California Verbal Learning Test both\n‘measure verbal learning using a word-list methodology (Lezak et al.,\n2012). A cognitive test was analyzed separately when two or more\nstudies reported on that test but it could not be pooled with other tests\nas methodologies were not comparable. All data analyzed were ini-\ntially extracted and categorized by the first author (E.A.). Second and\nprior to meta-analyses, the extracted data were cross-checked by the\nsecond author (M.S.) against the original publication or communica-\ntion from authors who provided their data. Disagreements relative to\ncategorization were resolved through discussion between the authors.\n\nFrequently, cognitive tests yield more than a single outcome of\nperformance. For example, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test pro-\nvides results including errors and correct responses. It is recom-\n‘mended that cognitive outcomes are assessed separately to provide\na more detailed insight into the functions possibly compromised in\nMDD (Snyder, 2013). Where possible, cognitive outcomes within\nthe same domain were pooled together regardless of the specific\ncognitive test, for example, test errors, number of categories\nshifted between, number of trials taken to shift, correct responses,\nand time variables were formed within the shifting domain. To\naccount for small study numbers, an overall composite score was\nformed for each domain by pooling all cognitive data categorized\nwithin that domain. When necessary, effect sizes were averaged so\nthat each FED sample only contributed to one effect size per\nanalysis. This was done so as to avoid weighting individual studies\naccording to the number of tests or outcomes reported, in addition\nto ensuring statistical independence of effect sizes (Lipsey &\nWilson, 2001). Throughout, cognitive variable will be a general\nterm to refer to all possible categorizations within a cognitive\ndomain, for example, cognitive test or composite score.\n\nThe following were coded for each independent sample from each\nstudy: (a) number of FED patients and controls; (b) cognitive tests\nadministered; (c) mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) scores of\nperformance by FED patients and controls, or if not available, relevant\ninferential statistics; and (d) characteristics of patients (gender, de-\npression severity, mean age, medication, patient status, current or\nremitted depression, premorbid intelligence, age of onset, educational\nattainment, comorbidity, duration of FED).\n\nMeta-analysis. For cach study, effect sizes were calculated as\nCohen's d to compare the performance of FED patients to controls\non each cognitive variable. Cohen’s d effect size was calculated as\nMy — MSD yo5q Where M, is the mean cognitive performance of\nthe control group, M, is the mean cognitive performance of the\nFED group and SDpy. is the pooled standard deviation of the\ntwo groups. When M or SD were not reported, or could not be\nobtained from the author, effect size was estimated from the F\nstatistic using effect size calculation macros provided by Wilson\n(2001; k = 1), or were estimated from the z standard normal\ndeviate (Rosenthal & DiMatteo, 2001; k = 1).\n\nHedges’ g correction for small sample bias (Hedges & Olkin,\n1985), ¢ = d[1  (3df — 1)], where df equals the total number\nof participants, considering the FED patient and control groups\ncombined, minus 2. A positive g indicated a poorer performance\nby FED patients compared with controls. Therefore, the effect size\nwas inverted for measures where higher scores indicated worse\nperformance, that is, errors, time and overgeneral autobiographical\n‘memory. Outliers were omitted only from the analyses in which\nthey were outliers. An outlier was defined as an effect size =2 or\n+3 SDs from the mean effect size of each analysis (Snyder, 2013).\n‘When data was provided by FED patients at multiple time points,\nonly baseline data were assessed so as to maintain statistical\nindependence of effect sizes. In addition, this eliminated the pos-\nsibility of practice effects on test performance at follow-up assess-\n‘ments (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).\n\nTnverse-variance weighted, random-effects modeling was con-\nducted to provide an estimate of the mean effect size across studies\nfor each cognitive variable using Review Manager (v5.3; The\nCochrane Collaboration, 2014). The random-effects model as-\nsumes that there is more variability between studies than sampling\nerror alone (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009). The\nstudies included in this meta-analysis varied in terms of sample\ncharacteristics and the cognitive tests administered which neces-\nsitated the use of the random-effects model. Effect sizes were\nweighted by its inverse variance so that effect sizes with larger\nsamples would be given more weight (Borenstein et al., 2009).\n\nFor each analysis, a weighted, mean effect size and 95% con-\nfidence intervals were computed. The null hypothesis that the\neffect size is 0 was tested with z with an alpha level set at .05.\n‘Weighted, mean effect sizes were interpreted in accordance with\nthe recommendations of Cohen (1988), =0.2 = small, =0.5 =\n‘medium, =0.8 = large. Heterogeneity of effect sizes was assessed\nusing the Q statistic. This tests the null hypothesis that the vari-\nability between effect sizes in each study, contributing to the\nweighted, mean effect size, is attributable to chance. As the Q\nstatistic chi-squared test has low power in a meta-analysis with a\nsmall number of studies a p-level of .10 was applied, as recom-\n‘mended by Cochrane (Higgins & Green, 2008); p = .10 indicated\nthat there was much variability between the study effect sizes in\neach analysis. The I* index quantified the percentage of variability\nacross study effect sizes due to true differences and not chance.\nThis was interpreted in accordance with the recommended cut-\noffs: 25% = small, 50% = moderate, and 75% = large heteroge-\nneity (Borenstein et al., 2009).\n\nModerator analyses were conducted using a random-effects model\non Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (v.2.2; Biostat, nd;\nEnglewood, NJ) with the moderator variables prespecified.\nWhen =10 samples reported on a continuous moderator variable\n(depression severity, patient age, and medication), it was entered\nseparately into the metaregression model. Categorical variables, en-\ntered for subgroup analysis of variance, included patient status (inpa-\ntient vs. outpatient) and remission status (current depression vs. re-\n‘mission). A minimum of two studies in the smaller subgroup category\nwas required for subgroup analysis. The minimum study requirement\nwas to ensure that there was adequate power to predict moderator\nvariables that influenced effect size (Borenstein et al., 2009).\n\nPublication bias was conducted by visual assessment of funnel\nplots. Funnel plots were only generated when =10 samples were\n\n\n\nThis document is co\n\nThis art\n\n2\n\n56 AHERN AND SEMKOVSKA\n\nincluded in the analysis, as recommended by Borenstein et al.\n(2009). Egger’s test was used to quantify the amount of publication\nbias and was chosen as it is considered a more powerful test than\nthe rank correlation method. In cases of bias, trim and fill analyses\nwere conducted to yield an unbiased estimate of the effect size\n(Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).\n\nSystematic Review and Meta-Analysis IT\n\nSelection criteria. For the systematic review, inclusion crite-\nria for studies were as follows: (a) use of sample diagnosed with\nMDD according to DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR,\nDSM-5, ICD-9, or ICD-10 criteria; (b) participants must not have\npreviously been diagnosed with a major depressive episode; (c)\nparticipants were followed to remission using a repeated-measures\ndesign; (d) used at least one objective cognitive test. The additional\ncriterion for inclusion in the meta-analysis and the exclusion\ncriteria were the same as for the Systematic Review and Meta-\nAnalysis I.\n\nData extraction and recorded variables. Data extraction\nfollowed the same protocol as detailed for Systematic Review and\nMeta-Analysis I. From each study, the following were coded for\neach independent sample: (a) number of FED patients, (b) cogni-\ntive tests administered, (¢) M and SD of cognitive performance at\nbaseline and follow-up assessments, and (d) patient characteristics\n(gender, depression severity at baseline and follow-up, length of\ntime to follow-up, mean age, medication, current or remitted\ndepression, premorbid intelligence, age of onset, educational at-\ntainment, comorbidity, duration of FED).\n\nMeta-analysis. Standardized mean differences were calcu-\nlated as Cohen's d using the formula M, — M,/SD pc, Where M,\nis the mean, follow-up cognitive performance and M, is the mean,\nbaseline cognitive performance in FED patients. SD qqcq Was\ngiven by summing the baseline and follow-up SDs, and dividing by\n2. To calculate the variance of d for each cognitive variable, the\ncorrelation between the baseline and follow-up performance is\nrequired. As this was not available in any of the included studies,\na recommended global estimate of r = 70 was applied to calculate\n\nthe variance of d, (1 + £)[2(1 ~ 1]. where n is the number of\nFED patients (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). All effect sizes were\ncorrected for small sample bias using Hedges’ g formula. A\npositive g indicated that cognitive function improved at follow-up\ncompared with baseline.\n\nTnverse-variance weighted, random-effects models were applied\nfor each analysis, considering the variability in cognitive tests\npooled under a common domain (Borenstein et al, 2009). The\nremaining conduct of the meta-analytic process was the same as\ndetailed above for Meta-Analysis 1.\n\nResults\n\nSystematic Review I\n\nAfter deleting duplicates, 389 potentially relevant articles were\nidentified from which 30 were included in the meta-analysis. All\narticles were published in English. Seventeen authors were con-\ntacted for additional cognitive data (2 = 10) or for subgroup\nanalysis of FED patients from a sample of first-episode, affective\n\ndisorders (n = 7). Additional information was provided by four\nauthors which allowed the inclusion of those studies in the anal-\nysis; authors cited “too busy to prioritize location of data” (n = 4)\nas the main reason for not facilitating data requests. The review\nprocess is detailed in Figure 1.\n\nOf the studies included, the majority were published in England\n(k = 5), followed by China or U.S.A. (k = 4), then Norway (k =\n3). France, Finland, Japan, Turkey, and The Netherlands each\npublished two studies (k = 2), and Germany, Belgium, Australia,\nDenmark, and Canada each published one study (k = 1). A total of\n994 patients (subsample size range 9-49) and 1471 healthy con-\ntrols (sample size range 11-88) were included in the analysis. The\nFED group consisted of 356 males (35.81%) and 586 females\n(58.95%); 52 participants (5.23%) had no gender reported. The\nweighted, mean patient age was 27.40 years. The healthy control\ngroup contained 556 males (37.80%) and 761 females (51.73%);\ngender was not specified for 154 participants (10.47%). The\nweighted, mean control age was 29.99 years. For details of report-\ning on each prespecified moderator variable refer to Table 1.\n\nEight studies reported data for two FED subsamples. Sub-\nsamples included current and remitted FED patients (k = 4), or\npsychotic and nonpsychotic FED patients (k = 4). An effect size\nwas calculated for each FED subsample with respect to a single,\nhealthy control group, with the exception of one study that com-\npared each FED subsample to its own geographically matched,\nhealthy control group. One study reported data for three FED\nsubsamples (current, partial remission, and full remission) com-\npared with a single, healthy control group. As the same control\ngroup served as a comparison for more than one FED sample,\neffect sizes were not statistically independent (Reis & Judd, 2014).\nHowever, this method was chosen as remission and psychosis were\nintended to be explored as moderator variables which justified\nproviding a separate effect size for each subsample.\n\nFor each study, and relevant subsamples, cognitive performance\nplus coded variables are outlined in Table 1S in the supplementary\nonline data. Forty-one standardized, cognitive tests were identi-\nfied; for details of tests and categorization into the relevant cog-\nnitive domain refer to Table 2. A separate cognitive domain for\nreaction time (RT) was formed by pooling RTs from unstandard-\nized tests of sustained attention (k = 4). However, not all reported\ndata was meta-analyzable. Five study-level composite scores were\nexcluded, as they pooled tests from different cognitive domains:\nthe “Learning and memory” score from As et al. (2011) included\nboth verbal and visual tests; while the following four composite\nscores were excluded from Hill, Keshavan, Thase, and Sweeney\n(2004): “Attention” (pooled tests of processing speed and working\nmemory), “Executive function” (pooled tests of shifting and verbal\nfluency), “Verbal memory” and “Visual memory” (both pooled\ntests of learning and delayed).\n\nOnly one study reported on reward-based, decision making\n(Yang et al., 2014) which meant that this cognitive domain could\nnot be meta-analyzed. This study showed motivational deficits in\nFED patients relative to healthy controls, as well as an abnormal\nability to evaluate the probability and magnitude of expected\npay-offs. FED patients were not as willing to complete “hard\ntasks” requiring 20 button-presses within 4 seconds with the non-\ndominant pinkie finger, for higher monetary rewards, compared\nwith “easy tasks” which required 10 button-presses with the dom-\ninant index finger within 4 seconds, but lower rewards.\n\n\ng\n2\n3\n\n0 be disseminated broadly\n\nly for the personal use\n\nocument is copyrighted by the American Psycho\n\ncle is intended so\n\nThi\n\nCOGNITIVE DEFICITS FIRST-EPISODE DEPRESSION 57\n\n905 records identified through electronic\ndatabase searches\n\n29 additional records identified through\nreviews and hand-searched from journal\n\narticles\n934 studies\nidentified\n\nI» | 545 duplicates removed\n\n389 potentially relevant studies\n\n274 studies excluded after title /\nabstract screening\n\n115 full-text articles reviewed and\nassessed for eligibility\n\n76 full-text articles excluded\n\n9 authors contacted with requests for\nfull-text articles\n\n6 non-responses for full-text article\nrequests\n\n13 mixed sample (recurrent and\nfirst-episode depression)\n\n3 no DSM / ICD diagnosis of\nMDD\n\n9 no healthy controls\n20 no validated cognitive tests used\n\n5 non-English publications\n\n39 relevant studies\n\n1 diagnosis other than MDD\n\n6 redundant reports\na) 13 reviews / symposium abstracts\nadditional cognitive data, subgroup.\nanalysis\n\n8 studies excluded\n\n4100 busy to prioritise locating\ndata\n\n2 data no longer available\n\nreview\n\n31 studies included in systematic\n\n2 no response to repeated requests\n\n30 meta-analysed\n\n- 26 data available\n4 provided data upon request\n\nFigure 1.\n\nFlowchart for selection of studies relating to pattern and extent of cognitive impairment in\n\nfirst-episode depression (Systematic Review and Meta-analysis 1). ICD = International Classification of\nDiseases; DSM = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual; MDD = major depressive disorder.\n\nIn addition, planning ability could not be meta-analyzed as data\nwas only reported by two studies which used different scoring\nsystems (CANTAB Stockings of Cambridge test, Maalouf et al.,\n2011; Tower of London test, Schmid & Hammar, 2013a). These\nstudies did not obtain fully consistent results. Schmid and Hammar\n\n(2013) observed no significant differences in planning between\nFED patients and controls. Similarly, Maalouf et al. (2011) did not\nfind a significant difference in planning between remitted FED\npatients and controls. However, a group-by-difficulty level inter-\naction was demonstrated where current FED patients performed\n\n\nis intended so\n\n58 AHERN AND SEMKOVSKA\n\nTable 1\n% Studies in Systematic Review I (k = 31) Reporting on Each\nModerator Variable\n\nModerator % Studies\nPatient status (outpatient or inpatient) 93.55\nRemission status (current or remission) 100.00\nMean age 96.77\nMedication (% patients) 87.10\nDepression severity 87.10\nAge of onset 22.58\nAxis T comorbidity 64.52\nDuration FED* 54.84\nEducational attainment* 54.84\nPremorbid IQ* 25.81\nPsychotic features (psychotic or non-psychotic)” 22.58\n\nNote.

This indicates\nthat for FED patients, planning may only be minimally impaired,\nand present only during the depressed state, with deficits emerging\nas a function of task complexity.\n\nMeta-Analysis I\n\nTable 3 details the weighted, mean effect sizes for cognitive\nperformance in FED patients compared with healthy controls.\nOutlier screening resulted in the exclusion of three effect sizes\nwhich are detailed in the note to Table 3. As a result of outlier\nscreening, cognitive status, assessed by the Mini Mental State\n‘Examination, was no longer eligible for meta-analysis (k = 1).\nNevertheless, results indicated that FED patients were impaired\nrelative to controls (Maeshima et al., 2012).\n\nProcessing speed. Data assessing processing speed was de-\nrived from four tests and a study-level composite score pooled into\nfour variables (see Table 2). Effect sizes ranged from nonsignifi-\ncant to large. FED patients did not perform any slower in number-\ncoding tests compared with controls (g = 0.37, p = .10), although\nresults between studies were largely heterogeneous, O(7) = 36.06,\np< .00001, I* = 81%. Relative to controls, FED patients showed\na small impairment in TMT-A (g = 0.42, p = .004), a moderate\nimpairment in the processing speed composite score (g = 0.63,\np< .0001) and a large impairment in the Stroop test color naming\nand word reading conditions (g = 0.93, p < .00001).\n\n'Visuospatial attention. Data assessing visuospatial attention\nwas derived from the Spatial Span Forward test reported by three\nstudies. FED patients showed a small impairment in visuospatial\nattention compared with controls (¢ = 0.32, p = .02).\n\nAuditory attention. Data assessing auditory attention was\nderived from the Digit Span Forward test reported by three studies.\nRelative to controls, FED patients showed a small impairment in\nauditory attention (g = 0.35, p = .03).\n\nSustained visual attention. Data for sustained visual atten-\ntion was provided by three tests which were pooled into two\nvariables. FED patients showed a small impairment in the sus-\ntained attention composite score (¢ = 0.43, p = .003) but did not\n\nproduce significantly more errors than controls (g = 0.34, p =\n18).\n\nRT sustained visual attention. RT for sustained visual atten-\ntion was derived from unstandardized tests and pooled into three\nvariables. FED patients did not differ from controls in simple RT\n(2 = 0.11, p = .59), complex tracking RT (g = —0.02, p = .92),\nor the RT composite score (g = 0.06, p = .78).\n\nVisuospatial working memory. Data assessing visuospatial\nworking memory was derived from six tests and a study-level\ncomposite score pooled into two variables. Relative to controls,\nFED patients were moderately impaired on the visuospatial work-\ning memory composite score (g = 0.74, p = .005) and produced\na significantly, larger number of errors (g = 1.05, p < .00001).\n\nAuditory working memory. Data assessing auditory working\n‘memory was derived from two tests and pooled into two variables.\nFED patients showed a small impairment in the Digit Span Back-\nwards test (g = 0.33, p = .02) and in the auditory working memory\ncomposite score (g = 0.39, p < .0001) compared with controls.\n\nAutobiographical memory. Data assessing autobiographical\n‘memory, measured as the proportion of overgeneral memories,\nwas derived from two studies. Relative to controls, FED patients\nshowed a moderate impairment and produced more overgeneral,\nautobiographical memories in response to positive or negative\nwords (g = 0.69, p < .0001). The results of a third study (Nan-\ndrino, Pezard, Poste, Reveillere, & Beaune, 2002) were not meta-\nanalyzable as cognitive data were not available. However, results\nwere partially consistent with that of the meta-analysis as FED\npatients produced a greater proportion of overgeneral memories\nfor positive, but not for negative cue words, relative to controls.\n\nVisual learning. Data for visual learning was derived from\ntwo tests reported by five studies. Relative to controls, FED\npatients were moderately impaired in the Visual Reproduction T\ntest (g = 0.65, p = .01) and in the visual learning composite score\n(2 = 0.64, p = .001).\n\nDelayed visual memory. Data for delayed visual memory\nwas derived from four tests and pooled into two variables. FED\npatients demonstrated a small impairment in the delayed visual\n‘memory composite score compared with controls (g = 0.39, p =\n.01) and a moderate impairment in the Visual Reproduction II test\n(2 = 0.70, p = .03). However, the overlap in confidence intervals\nindicates that the true effect sizes may not be substantially differ-\nent (composite score: 95% CI [0.08, 0.70]; Visual Reproduction IT\ntest: 95% CI [0.07, 1.32]).\n\nVerbal memory recognition. Data for verbal memory recog-\nnition was pooled from three tests reported by three studies. FED\npatients did not show any impairment in verbal memory recogni-\ntion compared with controls (¢ = 0.37, p = .15). Moderate\nheterogeneity between the studies, 03) = 9.04, p = 03, I =\n67%, likely explains the nonsignificant findings.\n\nVerbal learning. Data for verbal learning was derived from\nfive tests which provided three variables. Effect sizes ranged from\nnonsignificant to moderate. FED patients showed a trend toward a\nsmall impairment in the verbal learning composite score (g = 0.31,\np = .05), however, as the confidence interval contained zero, it is\nassumed that no difference in the composite score exists between\nFED patients and controls (95% CI [0.00, 0.63]).

Because of insufficient num-\nber of studies, only five of the prespecified moderators could be\n‘meta-analyzed to try and account for this unexplained heteroge-\nneity between studies (see Table 1).\n\nRemission. Subgroup analysis was possible for 17 variables.\nRemission (see Table 4) was associated with performance compa-\nrable to healthy controls on 15 of these variables. Remitted FED\npatients were less impaired than current FED patients and compa-\nrable to controls in number-coding (p = .007), TMT-A (p = .006),\nprocessing speed composite score (p < .0001), word-list learning\n(p = 03), word-list delayed (p = .05), storytelling delayed (p =\n102), delayed verbal memory composite score (p = .09), and IQ\n(p = 05). Remitted FED patients were not less impaired than\ncurrent FED patients in autobiographical memory (p = .47), visual\nlearning composite (p = .34), Visual Reproduction II (p = .35),\ndelayed visual memory (p = .47), verbal learning composite (p =\n112), shifting errors (p = .75), or shifting composite (p = .55).\nHowever, remitted FED performed similar to controls as the con-\nfidence intervals of effect size for each of these variables crossed\nzero (Borenstein et al., 2009).\n\nPatient status. Subgroup analysis was possible for 18 vari-\nables. Inpatient status was significantly associated with more im-\npairment in number-coding relative to outpatients (p = .0004; see\nTable 5). No significant difference was observed in inpatient\nperformance compared with outpatients in any other variable (p >\n.10). However, as the confidence intervals crossed zero, it can be\nconcluded that inpatient performance was comparable to controls\nin TMT-A, delayed visual memory composite, word-list learning,\nverbal learning composite, word-list delayed, delayed verbal mem-\nory composite, shifting categories, errors, and IQ. Similarly, out-\npatient performance was comparable with healthy controls in\nnumber-coding, TMT-A, processing speed composite, sustained\nvisual attention composite, visual learning composite, delayed\nvisual memory composite, word-list learning, verbal learning com-\nposite, shifting time, and IQ.\n\nAge. Metaregression was possible for nine variables. Higher\nage at onset significantly predicted larger impairments in IQ (b =\n03, z = 2.77, p = .006) but smaller impairments in word-list\ndelayed memory relative to controls (b = —.04,z = —2.06, p =\n.04). Age was not significantly associated with any other variable:\nfor TMT-A, processing speed composite, verbal learning compos-\nite, delayed verbal memory composite, shifting (categories, errors,\nand composite), all p > .20.\n\nMedication (% patients). Metaregression was possible for\nsix variables: processing speed composite, verbal learning com-\nposite, delayed verbal memory composite, shifting (categories,\nerrors, and composite). Medication was not significantly associ-\nated with the extent of impairment in any of these cognitive\nvariables (all p > 36).\n\nDepression severity. Where possible, depression severity\nscores were transformed to the Hamilton Rating Scale for\n\nDepression-17 items scale (HRSD-17) using formulae proposed\nby Heo, Murphy, and Meyers (2007; HRSD-17 = — 1.58 + 0.86\n[MADRS score]) and Vittengl, Clark, Kraft, and Jarrett (2005;\nHRSD-17 = 0.65 + 0.67 [BDI-II]). After transformation to\nHRSD-17 scores, sufficient data were available to perform metare-\ngressions on six variables: processing speed composite, verbal\nlearning composite, delayed verbal memory (word list delayed and\ncomposite), and shifting (categories and composite). Depression\nseverity was not significantly associated with the extent of impair-\n‘ment in any cognitive variable (all p > 18).\n\nPublication bias. Sufficient sample numbers (1 = 10) meant\nthat it was possible to analyze funnel plots for nine variables.\nEggers test indicated a publication bias for studies reporting\ngreater impairment in the shifting composite variable relative to\nthe estimated, mean performance among FED patients (Egger’s\nintercept = 5.58, p = .008). For visual presentation of publication\nbias in the shifting composite variable, a funnel plot (standardized\nmean difference between FED patients and healthy controls vs.\nstandard error) is presented in Figure 2. Trim and fill analyses\nrevealed that after controlling for publication bias and imputing the\neffect sizes for six hypothetical, missing studies, the adjusted,\nweighted mean effect size was significant, although it indicated a\nsmaller impairment in FED patients relative to healthy controls\n(2 = 0.27). All other Egger’s tests were nonsignificant, p value\nrange .07 to .53.\n\nSystematic Review IT\n\nThe same articles returned from the database search, as outlined\nin Part 1 of the review, were screened using the updated inclusion\nand exclusion criteria. Seven authors were contacted with requests\nfor additional data of which four responded; one provided addi-\ntional descriptive statistics, two cited “too busy to prioritize locat-\ning data,” and one author reported “data no longer available.” The\nreview process is detailed in Figure 3.\n\nThe included studies were published in Japan, France, Spain,\nand Norway (k = 1 published in each country). A total of 92 FED\npatients (subsample size range 5-30) were included in the review,\nconsisting of 26 males (28.16%) and 32 females (34.78%); 34\nparticipants (36.96%) had no gender reported. The weighted mean\npatient age was 40.29 years, with a weighted mean follow-up\nperiod of 17.68 months. For each study, and relevant subsamples,\nbaseline and follow-up cognitive performance plus coded variables\nare detailed in Table 2S in the supplementary online data.\n\nBecause of insufficient number of studies, it was not possible to\n‘meta-analyze the data provided by two studies (Maeshima et al.,\n2012; Nandrino et al., 2002). Maeshima and colleagues (2012)\nassessed visual and verbal learning and memory in remitted, FED\npatients. Results showed that impaired performance on the Logical\nMemory and Visual Reproduction tests did not persist at follow-up\n(mean 3.2 years) and were comparable with the performance of\nhealthy controls. Nandrino and colleagues (2002) evaluated the\npercentage of overgeneral autobiographical memories produced\nfollowing remission of FED. They observed that, after a 28-day\ninterval, FED patients produced less overgeneral memories, with a\ncomplete normalization of function for negative autobiographical\n‘memories.\n\nTwo studies (Roca et al., 2015; Schmid & Hammar, 2013b)\nreported comparable data and thus were meta-analyzed.

Moderator and publication bias analyses were not\nconducted due to insufficient number of samples.\n\nerator analysis and publication bias.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to\ndetermine the pattern and extent of cognitive impairment in the\nFED. In addition, we sought to determine how certain moderators\ninfluenced the extent of impairment, and finally, to explore\n\nwhether the observed impairment persisted, or was present only\nduring the depressive episode.\n\nThe Pattern and Extent of Cognitive Impairment\n\nFED patients displayed a broad range of impairment across\ncognitive domains. Relative to healthy controls, no significant\nimpairment was observed in number-coding speed, errors and RT\nfor sustained visual attention, verbal memory recognition, or word-\nlist learning. In general, small impairments were noted in the\ncomposite scores for visuospatial, auditory and sustained visual\nattention, auditory working memory, delayed visual memory, ver-\nbal learning composite, delayed verbal memory, motor skills, and\n1Q. Moderate impairment was observed in processing speed, visu-\nospatial working memory, autobiographical memory, visual learn-\ning, storytelling learning, reasoning, inhibition, shifting, and verbal\nfluency. Large impairments were shown in the Stroop color nam-\ning and word reading speed, visuospatial working memory errors,\nand shifting correct responses. The extent of impairment was\nassociated with remission, patient status, and age. Remitted FED\npatients were comparable with controls in processing speed, learn-\ning and memory (both verbal and visual), autobiographical mem-\nory, shifting, and IQ. Inpatient status did not contribute explaining\nthe heterogeneity in observed results. Increasing mean patient age\nwas associated with more impairment in IQ, but less impairment in\nword-list delayed memory relative to controls. A very small num-\nber of studies (n = 4) of cognitive function followed FED patients\nuntil remission. They showed moderate improvement in process-\ning speed and a small improvement in shifting between over-\nlearned sequences (TMT-B), but a persistent impairment in Stroop\ncolor naming and word reading speed, inhibition, shifting between\neffortful and automatic processing (Stroop Switching) and verbal\nfluency (both letter and semantic).\n\nOverall, our findings are fairly consistent with the only meta-\nanalysis of cognitive function in FED to date (Lee, Hermens,\nPorter, & Redoblado-Hodge, 2012). Similar levels of impairment\nin processing speed, attention, visual learning and memory, and\nshifting were shown. Our findings of small to large impairments\nacross working memory and verbal learning and memory, how-\never, were not observed in the Lee et al. (2012) meta-analysis.\nAlthough, as only 13 studies were included, it is likely that Lee’s\n‘meta-analysis might have been underpowered to detect significant\ndifferences in performance (Borenstein et al., 2009). Impairment in\nworking memory and verbal learning and memory have been\nreported in recurrent, MDD patients (Rock et al., 2014; Wagner et\nal., 2015), with a similar extent of impairment to that observed in\nthe present meta-analysis.\n\n\n\nCOGNITIVE DEFICITS FIRST-EPISODE DEPRESSION 65\n\nTable 5\nInpatient Status Subgroup Analysis of Variance\n\n95% CI\nVariable k n N s IL UL ow 0b »\n\nProcessing speed\nNumber-coding\n\nOutpatient 2 4 7% —.18 10 60\nInpatient 3 4 12 91 144 1128 1252 0004\nTMT-A\nOutpatient 4 6 126 31 —.06 69 1279\nInpatient 3 3 7% 49 —.06 104 6.02 21 61\nComposite\nOutpatient 5 7 147 42 -03 87 24.62\nInpatient 4 5 133 70 2 118 162 73 39\nSustained visual attention\nComposite\nOutpatient 4 5 18 34 04 Ell 782\nInpatient 2 2 31 66 2 1.09 29 124 21\nVisual learning\nComposite\nOutpatient 3 3 67 66 04 136 9.16\n: Inpatient 2 2 31 63 20 1.06 00 00 95\nE Delayed visual memory\ng Composite\n- Outpatient 5 7 147 39 78 19.84\nE] Inpatient 2 2 31 41 8 1 01 94\nEl Verbal learning\n£2 ‘Word-list\n7s Outpatient 3 5 97 —.14 —.40 12 329\nInpatient 2 2 44 33 ~56 122 636 99 2\nComposite\nOutpatient 6 8 164 16 52 22.70\nInpatient 3 3 54 51 121 9.10 76 38\nDelayed verbal memory\nWord-list\nOutpatient 5 7 116 29 03 54 8.96\nInpatient 3 3 54 53 —.08 114 69 51 47\nEl Composite\n32 Outpatient 8 10 183 36 14 59 15.64\n22 Inpatient 3 3 54 52 08 112 6.66 22 64\n£7 Verbal fluency\nga Letter fluency\n2g Outpatient 4 4 90 46 17 5 1.10\n£3 Inpatient 2 2 31 51 09 94 8 03 85\nEl Semantic fluency\na Outpatient 3 3 71 85 50 119 112\nInpatient 2 2 31 70 21 113 81 28 60\nComposite\nOutpatient 4 4 116 63 34 92 79\nInpatient 2 2 31 63 21 1.06 54 00 99\nShifting\nCategories\nOutpatient 5 7 147 40 62 95\nInpatient 4 6 138 33 kl 139 a1 74\nErrors\nOutpatient 5 7 145 44 12 5 12.77\nInpatient 4 6 136 41 —02 85 16.73 o1 9\nTime\n\n(table continues)\n\n\nocument is\n\nis\n\nT\nThis article is i\n\n66 AHERN AND SEMKOVSKA\n\nTable 5 (continued)\n\n95% CI\nVariable k n N s IL UL ow 0b »\nOutpatient 2 2 50 61 —.06 139 2.86\nInpatient 3 3 7% 55 25 85 196 09 m\nComposite\nOutpatient 8 10 240 40 19 62 14.46\nInpatient 6 8 204 37 09 65 15.16 04 85\nIntelligence\n1Q composite\nOutpatient 8 12 343 12 -03 21 693\nInpatient 1 2 57 7 -30 175 745 130 25\nNote.

Lee et al.\n(2012) found antidepressants to be associated with poorer verbal\nlearning and memory, but improved shifting in FED patients.\nNevertheless, their findings must be interpreted with caution as\nregression analysis was conducted on fewer than the recommended\n10 samples (shifting, n = 7; Borenstein et al., 2009), and they used\na more liberal alpha level of .10 to determine significance. In line\nwith our findings, Hasselbalch, Knorr, and Kessing (2011) noted\nthat the association between medication and cognitive function is\nnot clearly established. This owes to the fact that it is difficult to\nparse the direct effects of medication from other clinical, patient\ncharacteristics such as depression severity or the number of past\nepisodes. Therefore, independent of past episodes, it is possible\nthat the extent of impairment is not significantly associated with\n‘medication in FED patients.\n\n3\n\nHodge's 2\n\nFigure 2.

This is inconsistent\nwith the results of Porter et al. (2007), who noted larger cognitive\nimpairment in recurrent, MDD inpatients relative to outpatients.\nHowever, the authors acknowledged that the length and number of\npast episodes likely explains why MDD patients are hospitalized\nand therefore, some extent of the impairment among inpatients.\nNotwithstanding, Lee et al. (2012) observed greater impairments\nin FED inpatients relative to outpatients. Yet, their sample were on\naverage older (M = 39.36 years) than the sample in the current\nreview (M = 27.40 years). Therefore, it is likely that differences in\nthe extent of impairment observed in FED inpatients in each\nmeta-analysis could be attributed to age differences between the\npatient samples. Taken together, a broad pattern of cognitive\nimpairment is observed from the FED but consideration must be\npaid to patient characteristics and how this influences the extent of\nimpairment experienced by patients.\n\nPersistence of Impairment at the FED: State, Scar, or\nTrait Markers?\n\nImportantly, the persistence of impairment at the FED must be\ndetermined, considering that this has been identified as a vulner-\nability for recurrence, as well as a key determinant of functional\nrecovery (Bortolato et al., 2016). In the present meta-analysis,\nprocessing speed and memory showed a normalization of function\nwith remission, consistent with previous reviews (Douglas & Por-\nter, 2009; Lee et al., 2012). Additionally, we demonstrated that\nlearning, autobiographical memory, shifting, and IQ were restored\nto normal levels of function with remission. Impairment in these\ndomains therefore likely represents state markers.\n\nMoreover, normalization in performance observed in shifting\nsuggests that executive function is somewhat sensitive to the\ndepressive state at the FED. Nevertheless, a caveat of tests mea-\nsuring executive function is that they are overly reliant on time\n‘measures and processing speed (Lezak et al., 2012). As discussed,\nprocessing speed normalizes with remission, so it could equally be\nargued that improvement in executive function is explained by\nimproved processing speed (Nebes et al., 2000). However, FED\npatients showed a persistent impairment in the Stroop color nam-\ning and word reading processing speed condition (g = 0.11, p =\n\n\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\n‘This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\n\nCOGNITIVE DEFICITS FIRST-EPISODE DEPRESSION 67\n\n905 records identified through\nelectronic database searches\n\n29 additional records identi\nreviews and hand-searched from journal\narticles\n\ned through\n\n934 studies\n\n545 duplicates removed\n\n389 potentially relevant studies\n\n269 studies excluded after title / abstract\nscreening\n\n120 full text articles reviewed and\nassessed for eligibility\n\n111 full-text articles excluded\n\n39 no follow-up assessment\n24 no validated cognitive tests used\n\n13 mixed sample (recurrent and first-\nepisode depression)\n\n13 reviews! symposium abstracts\n\n6 non-responses for full-text article\nrequests\n\n6 redundant reports\n\n9 relevant studies\n\n5 non-English publications\n\n310 DSM / ICD diagnosis of MDD\n1 diagnosis other than MDD\n\n{{muthars contacted with requests for 1 participants not remitted at follow-up\nadditional data\n5 studies excluded\n2 authors too busy to locate missing\n_\ndata\nv 2 no response to repeated requests\n4 studies included in systematic review 1 datano longer availsble\n\n2 meta-analysed\n\n-1 data available\n\n-1 provided data upon request\n\nFigure 3.

Thus, processing speed alone could not account for the\nimprovement in shifting. However, larger improvements in the\nprocessing speed condition of the Trail Making Test-A (g = 0.68)\nwere observed relative to small improvements in the timed, shift-\ning condition of the Trail Making Test-B (g = 0.45), suggesting\nthat speed was associated with subsequent shifting improvement. It\n\nis possible to argue, given these results, that the “less effortful”\nshifting between overlearned sequences (alphabet; counting for\nTMT-B) is improved following the processing speed normaliza-\ntion observed in remission, whereas the “more effortful” shifting\nbetween reading and inhibiting of reading (Stroop Switching) does\nnot beneficiate from this normalization and stays impaired.

Yet, as the majority of research has been\nconducted on recurrent patients, and not determined whether im-\npairment predated the FED, the possibility of scarring effects\ncannot be ruled out (Hasselbalch et al., 2011). Considering our\nfindings of improvement in shifting upon remission, it is possible\nthat persistence of executive function is a result of recurrent\nepisodes which contribute additional impairment, overall leading\nto maintenance of the impairment. This assumes the scar hypoth-\nesis (Kessing, 1998). However, it remains to be determined\nwhether the FED is sufficient to ensure persistence. Considering\nsmall improvements in inhibition were shown in FED patients at\nremission (g = 0.33) relative to moderate impairment during the\ncurrent state compared with healthy controls (g = 0.76), it can be\nspeculated that impaired inhibition remained residually as a scar of\nthe FED. Yet, as it was not possible to compare inhibition in\nremitted FED patients to healthy controls, the probability of com-\nplete normalization of function at the FED cannot be ruled out.\nVerbal fluency was the only executive function that persisted at a\nstable level of impairment, consistent with trait-qualities. Again,\nhowever, it is inconclusive whether persistence in verbal fluency\nrepresents a trait marker, or possibly a scar, unless the impairment\nwas observed to predate the FED.\n\nFor the most part, the majority of cognitive domains in the FED\nappear to have state-like qualities, normalizing with remission.\nPersistence of deficits in verbal fluency, and likely residual per-\nsistence of deficits in inhibition, requires additional research to\ndetermine the exact nature as either a trait, or scarring consequence\nof the FED.\n\nLimitations\nThis meta-analysis, however, is not without limitations. First,\n\npossible bias for any meta-analysis is that a comprehensive search\nof published material was not completed. Funnel plots revealed\n\nsignificance level; = heterogeneity statistic; TMT-A = Trail Making Test-A; UL = upper limit.\n\nthat studies with small patient samples, that reported nonsignifi-\ncant differences in shifting in FED patients compared with con-\ntrols, were likely to not be published. As it was not possible to\nproduce funnel plots for all cognitive domains, it cannot be con-\nfirmed whether publication bias accounted for some degree of\nimpairment in FED patients, if there is a tendency to not publish\nstudies which show little or no impairment (Borenstein et al.,\n2009).\n\nSecond, considering the significant heterogeneity of 21 cogni-\ntive variables included in the two parts of the meta-analysis (see\nTables 3 and 6), it is apparent that the studies varied largely in the\ncharacteristics of the patients assessed, or the methods used. How-\never, insufficient study numbers meant that possible moderators\n(e.g. length of depressive episode) could not be assessed to de-\ntermine how they influenced the extent of cognitive impairment.\nMoreover, previous reviews have suggested that depression sever-\nity is associated with cognitive impairment in MDD (McDermott\n& Ebmeier, 2009). However, the variance in depression severity\nscales used in the studies meant that some data could not be\ntranslated into a HRSD-17 score to be included in the analysis.\nOtherwise, this may have allowed for more power to detect a\nsignificant effect.\n\nThird, it would be important to determine whether different\ncognitive profiles are associated with subtypes of depression.\nSeven psychotic samples were included in the analysis, yet an\ninsufficient number of studies meant that subgroup analysis could\nnot be conducted. Study-level results, however, showed a trend of\n‘more severe impairment in executive function (Ilonen et al., 2000;\nTaiminen et al., 2000), memory and visuospatial attention (Hill,\nKeshavan, Thase, & Sweeney, 2004) in psychotic, FED patients\ncompared with nonpsychotic, FED patients.\n\nFuture Directions and Conclusion\n\nOur findings have shown that cognitive function is impaired at\nthe FED in a broad range of cognitive domains. However, there is\nlittle evidence in FED patients for several cognitive domains\nknown to be affected during recurrent episodes, for example,\nplanning (Snyder, 2013). Future studies should look to include an\n\n\nocument is\n\nThis\nThis article is i\n\n0 be disseminated bi\n\nuser and is ng\n\nthe individua\n\nCOGNITIVE DEFICITS FIRST-EPISODE DEPRESSION 69\n\nextensive testing battery to determine the full breadth and pattern\nof cognitive ability from the FED.\n\nMoreover, the association between medication and cognitive\nfunction deserves further research consideration. Rock et al.\n(2014) demonstrated small to moderate impairment in unmedi-\ncated, recurrent MDD patients relative to healthy controls in at-\ntention, memory, and executive function. Yet, as only 33.33% of\nthe samples included in this meta-analysis were unmedicated,\nresearch on unmedicated patient samples would be necessary to\ndetermine the true pattern of impairment at the FED.\n\nAbove all, research on cognitive impairment in MDD requires\nadditional, longitudinal assessment of FED patients. This is nec-\nessary to better understand the relationship between cognitive\nimpairment and the course of MDD from the FED. The present\nreview showed that only 4 studies followed FED into remission\nwhile collecting both acute episode and postepisode cognitive data.\nThus the persistence of FED-associated deficits could be assessed\nonly for processing speed and some components of executive\nfunction. Specifically, longitudinal assessment would help to es-\ntablish if persistence, as observed in recurrent patients in domains\nsuch as attention and inhibition (Bora et al., 2013), develops as a\nscar of recurrent, depressive episodes.\n\nThe implications of our findings for clinical practice, however,\nhighlight the importance of treating cognitive impairment in FED\npatients. It is suggested that emphasis must be placed on a “cog-\nnitive remission” to achieve a full, functional recovery from MDD\n(Bortolato et al., 2016). The authors outlined that this involves\ntreating the cognitive impairment, alongside mood symptoms, to\nnegate the likelihood of persistence, even residually, when mood\nhas been restored. As our analysis has evidenced, verbal fluency,\nand likely inhibition, show already persistent deficits following the\nFED. Therefore, cognitive interventions that may help to maintain\ncognitive function, and/or negate the possibility of persistence\nshould be implemented into clinical practice right from onset of\nthe FED. Computerized cognitive remediation, which uses cogni-\ntive exercises to activate neural networks within the brain that\nrelate to specific cognitive abilities, has shown much promise in\nrestoring cognitive function (Porter, Bowie, Jordan, & Malhi,\n2013). Although research on this intervention is limited, a recent\n‘meta-analysis showed moderate to large improvements in attention\nand working memory, with small to large improvements transfer-\nrable to global everyday functioning in MDD patients (Motter et\nal., 2016).\n\nIn conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis demon-\nstrated that, even from the FED, there are small to large impair-\n‘ments in a range of cognitive abilities. For the most part, cognitive\nimpairment showed state-like qualities, normalizing with remis-\nsion. However, some persistence was already observed from the\nFED, with additional persistence in executive function possibly\nemerging as a scar of subsequent, depressive episodes. Longitudi-\nnal assessment of FED patients is required to further explore the\nrelationship between cognitive deficits persistence and the course\nof MDD. Yet, as the persistence of impairment is of clinical\nimportance for functional recovery, this meta-analysis highlights\nthe need for interventions to treat cognitive impairment, alongside\ndepressed mood symptoms, to promote functional recovery right\nfrom the FED.\n\nReferences\n\n“Indicates references included in the systematic review and meta-\nanalysis (see supplemental online data).\n\n“As, M., Dazzan, P., Fisher, H.
