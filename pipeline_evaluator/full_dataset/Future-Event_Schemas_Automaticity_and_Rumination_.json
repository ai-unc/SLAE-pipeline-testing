Andersen1,2and Christie Limpert1We examined the proposition that indi viduals with major depression make predictionsabout future e vents relati vely automatically and pessimistically, re\ufb02ecting use of afuture-e vent schema, while they also ruminate about the future. Depressed participantsand nondepressed controls indicated whether or not various positi ve and negati vefuture e vents would happen to them or to an a verage other\u2014either under a concurrentattentional load or no such load\u2014while their response latencies were assessed. Ashypothesized, depressi ves showed relati vely greater automaticity in their predictionsthan did nondepressi ves, and a lack of optimism as well. More speci\ufb01cally, depressi vesshowed a smaller increase in response latency due to the introduction of the attentionalload than did nondepressi ves, suggesting relati vely greater processing ef\ufb01ciency, andthey also predicted reliably fewer positi veevents. Indeed, depressi ves also reportedruminating more about the future based on a recent distressing life e vent. O verall,the results extend research on future-e vent schemas and automaticity (Andersen,Spielman, & Bargh, 1992) from moderate to major depression and establish a linkwith future-e vent rumination.KEY WORDS: depression; rumination; schemas; cognition.Cognitive theories of depression suggest that hopeless expectations about thefuture play a fundamental role in depression (e.g., Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy,1989; Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978; Beck, 1967, 1976). According to Beck(1967, pp. 256\u2013261), a negative cognitive triad of beliefs, about the self, the world,and the future, plays an etiological role in depressed mood (although purely cogni-tive models of depression have, of course, been challenged, e.g., Coyne & Gotlib,1983; Haaga, Dyck, & Ernst, 1991). These three types of beliefs are interrelatedand yet they are also conceptually distinct. One\u2019s ideas about the future are notidentical to one\u2019s views of the self, nor to one\u2019s perceptions of the world. Indeed,views about the self do not always generalize even to views about others (e.g.,1Department of Psychology, New York University, New York, New York.2Correspondence should be directed to Susan M.

Hence, cognitions about the futureand cognitions about the self cover different territory.According to Beck (1967, 1976), patterns of self-interpretation in depressioncan be conceived in terms of self-schemas, mental representations of past experi-ences and generic knowledge about the self. Indeed, much research has examinedand demonstrated the operation of self-schemas in depression (e.g., Bargh & Tota,1988; Hammen, Marks, de Mayo, & Mayol, 1985; Segal, Gemar, Truchon, Guir-guis, & Horowitz, 1995; Segal, Hood, Shaw, & Higgins, 1988; Teasdale, Taylor,Cooper, Hayhurst, & Paykel, 1995; Zuppan, Hammen, & Jaenicke, 1987; for reviewssee, Haaga et al., 1991; Segal, 1988).3However, in spite of widespread acknowledg-ment of the role of self-schemas in depression, and acceptance of the cognitivetriad in depression more broadly, little research has systematically examined theoperation of other elements of the triad or the notion that schematic knowledgeabout future e vents ought to exist among depressives.In our view, the way depressives think about future events is of importancebecause the manner in which future events are anticipated is integral to hopelessness(Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, Spielman, & Bargh, 1992; Garber, Miller, &Abramson, 1980; Hollon & Garber, 1980). Hopelessness has been central to eachrevision of the learned helplessness model (Abramson et al., 1978, 1989) and evi-dence suggests that depressives do in fact hold more pessimistic or hopeless expecta-tions about the future than do nondepressives, perceiving positive events as lesslikely and negative events as more likely (Alloy & Ahrens, 1987; Andersen, 1990;Andersen & Schwartz, 1992; MacLeod & Cropley, 1995; Pietromonaco & Markus,1985; Pyszczynski, Holt, & Greenberg, 1987; Reich & Weary, in press; Riskind,Rholes, Brannon, & Burdick, 1987).The present research extends work on hopelessness in which this construct isde\ufb01ned in terms of depressi ve predicti ve certainty , or the tendency to see futuresuffering as inevitable. This work has shown a strong association between suchdepressive predictive certainty and naturally occurring depression, in that moderatedepressives appear to feel certain that positive events will not occur and that negativeevents will (Andersen, 1990; Andersen & Schwartz, 1992; see also Andersen &Lyon, 1987). One implication is the possibility that depressives may have well-established knowledge that enables them to make quick judgments about the futurein the form of a future-e vent schema .Research on self-schemas among mild to moderate depressives has demon-strated automaticity in negative judgments about the self (e.g., Bargh & Tota, 1988),and research has begun to address the operation of future-e vent schemas amongdepressives as well. Speci\ufb01cally, the latter research has demonstrated that moder-ately depressed persons (college students) show automaticity in their predictionsabout the future, whereas nondepressed people do not (Andersen et al., 1992). Ineach case, this automatic processing involves relatively effortless judgments thatdo not require much attention.3Schemas are generally conceptualized as well-organized, highly ef\ufb01cient knowledge structures thatoperate relatively effortlessley. Hence, we assume that schematic processing involves such ease inprocessing as one aspect of automaticity (Bargh, 1989; Bargh & Tota, 1988; Hasher & Zacks, 1979).Future-Event Schemas 313More broadly, automaticity has been shown to have multiple components,including effortlessness or ef\ufb01ciency, uncontrollability, unintentionality, and uncon-sciousness (Bargh, 1989, 1994), components that do not necessarily cooccur. Hence,to require a process to have allfeatures of automaticity, rather than a particularfeature, would be to de\ufb01ne it out of existence. Of course, competing models ofautomatic processing also exist. That is, automaticity may arise based on the buildupof large numbers of relevant instances in memory through repeated experience andpractice with a stimulus or procedure such that this produces a special ease ofretrieval re\ufb02ected in automatic processing (e.g., Logan, 1988; Schmidt & Bjork,1992; Smith, 1989, 1994). By contrast, automaticity may be based on limits inattentional capacity that favor judgments based on recently or frequently usedmental representations (e.g., Bargh, 1989; Higgins & Bargh, 1987; Kahneman, 1973).Regardless, the general notion shared by these competing models is that automaticprocesses involve a relatively rapid, effortless ease of retrieval and use of storedknowledge (procedural or declarative). Automatic cognitive processes should thusoccur unabated in spite of other tasks requiring attention that must be performedsimultaneously (in a dual-task paradigm), and there should be a continuum of suchautomaticity rather than it being all-or-none. Prior research on future-event schemasamong depressives has assessed relatively effortless processing (Andersen et al.,1992), as did the present research.In previous research on future-event schemas, participants were asked to makeyes\u2013no judgments about whether or not various positive and negative events wouldhappen either to them or to an average other, while their response latencies wereassessed, and they did this task either under a concurrent attentional load or nosuch load. The results showed that these moderately depressed participants weremore pessimistic in that they predicted fewer positive events and more negativeevents than did either mild depressives or nondepressives. They also made theirfuture-event predictions with greater automaticity, overall, as de\ufb01ned in terms ofeffortlessness in processing. That is, introducing the attentional load did not reliablyincrease depressives\u2019 response latencies in predicting future events (whether positiveor negative), whereas the introduction of the attentional load did reliably increasethe response latencies of both mild depressives and nondepressives (again for bothpositive and negative future events). Such evidence provides a clear demonstrationof automaticity in the future-event predictions of moderate depressives.4This evidence thus suggests that moderate depressives possess a future-eventschema\u2014a well-de\ufb01ned set of expectations about the future that are relativelypessimistic\u2014enabling especially ef\ufb01cient processing of information about the future(Andersen et al., 1992; Reich & Weary, in press). By contrast, both nondepressives4The assessment of response latency in such a dual-task paradigm allows for assessment of effortlessnessas an element of automatic processing (Bargh, 1989, 1994). Tasks that proceed relatively effortlesslyshould not show interference effects based on an attentional load. That is, they should show lessinterference than do tasks that require effort. If a process requires little attention or effort, it shouldbe less affected by an attention-demanding task (Andersen et al., 1992). This is the case becauseaccessibility and ease in use of particular representations should not be driven by strategic processing,and should be relatively effortless and relatively undemanding of attention. A dual-task paradigm ofthis kind is thus useful in assessing relative processing ease or effortlessness regardless of which modelof automaticity is adopted (Kantowitz, 1974; Logan, 1979).314 Andersen and Limpertand mild depressives appear not to hold a schematized view of the future. In fact,nondepressives appear to be quite uncertain of the future and not in the leastschematized, quite appropriate given that the future is unknown. That is, althoughself-schemas exist both for depressives and for nondepressives, differing largely incontent (Bargh & Tota, 1988; although see Higgins, Van Hook, & Dorfman, 1988),only depressives schematically organize future-event knowledge in memory; nonde-pressives do not.Our assumption is that a mental structure enabling automatic future-eventpredictions is formed among depressives on the basis of the well-practiced processof attempting to anticipate and predict future events (Andersen et al., 1992; Reich &Weary, in press), and our approach is thus most consistent with a practice-effectsview of automaticity (Logan, 1988; Schmidt & Bjork, 1992; Smith, 1989). In thissense, rumination about the future should be at the root of automatic thoughtsabout the future among depressives, through the mechanism of practice effects.Rumination in depression is thought to involve a cascade of negative cognitions,creating still more intrusive thoughts (Beck, 1967, 1976; Beck, Rush, Shaw, &Emery, 1979; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). Future-event schemas may thus result inpart from relatively intentional, ruminative thought about the future based onnegative life events (Andersen et al., 1992), especially if depression is a coursethat begins with increasing rumination about the future which then deepens thedepression and eventually enables automaticity in future-event predictions. Thenotion that mild depressives may actually seek certainty in particular ways is sup-ported by research on social-perception processes among depressives (Weary &Edwards, 1994), and rumination may seem to reduce uncertainty. Interestingly,depressives who engage in rumination may do so because they believe it will helpthem to understand themselves and solve their problems, while in fact it serves tomaintain or even exacerbate their depression (Lyubomirsky & Nolen-Hoeksema,1993; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). Although the full implications of our model couldnot be assessed in the present research, the research does extend prior work onfuture-event schemas in depression and constitutes a preliminary effort to examineautomaticity in conjunction with rumination, all among individuals with majordepression.As pessimistic ideas about the future become elaborated and well rehearsedthrough strategic rumination, ideas about the future should come to mind relativelyeffortlessly, in an increasingly nonre\ufb02ective and involuntary way. Numerous studiessuggest that self-focused rumination maintains and exacerbates depression (e.g.,Ingram, Lumry, Cruet, & Sieber, 1987; Larsen & Cowan, 1988; Musson & Alloy,1988; Pyszczynski, Hamilton, Herring, & Greenberg, 1989; Smith, Ingram, & Roth,1985). When depressives ruminate, they show increases in depression in both corre-lational studies (Nolen-Hoeksema, Morrow, & Fredrickson, 1993) and experimentalstudies (Lyubomirsky & Nolen-Hoeksema, 1993, 1995; Nolen-Hoeksema & Mor-row, 1993). However, they show less depression when they engage in distraction,whereas among nondepressives, neither rumination nor distraction has these af-fective impacts.In addition, both laboratory and naturalistic studies have shown that de-pressives are especially likely to ruminate, and, perhaps as part of this, that theyFuture-Event Schemas 315come to express more negative expectations about the future, endorse more negativeinterpretations of events, and give more self-defeating explanations for negativeevents (e.g., Gibbons et al., 1985; Nolen-Hoeksema, Parker, & Larson, 1994; Pyszc-zynski et al., 1987, 1989). More broadly, a strong, positive relationship has beenshown between rumination and depression severity and duration, giving evidenceof the importance of rumination in depression (Morrow & Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990;Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991; Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1993, 1994).In the present research, we extended research on future-event schemas amongmoderate depressives into the realm of major depression, and examined future-event rumination as well. We used an assessment tool enabling DSM-IV diagnosis ofmajor depression (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), and randomly assigneddepressed participants and controls to an attentional load or no-load condition inwhich they made yesornopredictions about a variety of positive and negativefuture events either concerning the self or concerning an average other (Andersenet al., 1992). Our design and our measurement of response latency enabled us tostudy the process by which future-event judgments are made by people with majordepression, that is, its relative automaticity as de\ufb01ned in terms of effortlessness.This extends beyond the simple yes or no content of such judgments, and in generalbeyond self-reported \u2018\u2018automatic thoughts,\u2019\u2019 which index pessimism rather than on-line processing (Segal, 1988; see also Hartlage, Alloy, Vazquez, & Dykman, 1993).In this work, we hypothesized that individuals with major depression wouldshow relatively more automaticity in their future-event predictions than wouldnondepressives. This would be shown if the increase in latency due to load (versusno load) in making future-event predictions was smaller for depressives than fornondepressives. We thus predicted this effect in response latency for predictionsabout both positive and negative events. Practice in making future-event predictionsshould lead to a special ease of retrieval of future-event information and of priorpredictions among depressives due to a buildup of instances of practice in attemptingto predict the future (see also Logan, 1988; Smith, 1989, 1994). Hence, relativelygreater automaticity should be found among individuals with major depression.Such evidence would directly demonstrate \u2018\u2018automatic thoughts\u2019\u2019 about the futurein major depression and would suggest relatively more use of future-event schemasas well. Of course, we also predicted relatively greater pessimism in the yes\u2013noresponses of participants in predicting positive or negative events, as in prior work.Greater rumination based on a negative life event was also predicted. Moreover,the potential cooccurrence of rumination and future-event automaticity in majordepression would provide further grist for the speculation that ruminative processesmay underlie the formation of future-event schemas.METHODParticipants and OverviewCollege students with major depression were selected from a diverse populationof undergraduates at an urban university, in accordance with the DSM-IV speci\ufb01ca-316 Andersen and Limperttions (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), by means of their scores on avalidated instrument to diagnose major depression (Zimmerman, Coryell, Coren-thal, & Wilson, 1986). Thirty-seven undergraduates (22 females, 15 males) enrolledin an introductory psychology course participated in partial ful\ufb01llment of a courserequirement. They ranged in age from 18 to 26 years with a mean age of 19.4 yearsand were 65 %(24) White, 22 %(8) Asian American, 5 %(2) African American, 5 %(2) Hispanic, and 3 %(1) Native American.Although research on depression conducted with college students has evokedcontroversy because of questionable applicability to major depression (for reviews,see Coyne, 1994; Coyne & Gotlib, 1983; Gotlib, 1984; Vredenburg, Flett, & Krames,1993), we carefully preselected for individuals with major depression in the presentstudy. Depressives were preselected on the basis of their scores on the Inventoryto Diagnose Depression (IDD; Zimmerman et al., 1986), administered as part ofa mass testing session prior to the experiment, and readministered at the end ofthe experiment, from 2 to 22 weeks later, with an average of 9 weeks elapsing, toensure that all depressed participants remained clearly classi\ufb01able as \u2018\u2018cases\u2019\u2019 ofmajor depression in the experiment. As this implies, participants with major depres-sion are likely to have been symptomatic for at least 1 month and up to 6 monthsand not likely to have been subsyndromal. Although we cannot rule out dysthymicdisorder among these participants, this does not pose a problem in our effort totap \u2018\u2018caseness\u2019\u2019 in depression.Participants were classi\ufb01ed as having major depression if they scored 22 orgreater on the IDD, equivalent to a score of 16 or higher on the BDI, and if theymet the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depression, including the 2-weeksymptom duration. All participants retained their major depression classi\ufb01cationboth during the preselection phase and later in the experiment, showing consistencyover time. Participants were classi\ufb01ed as nondepressed if they scored 11 or belowon the IDD at both assessment times. Given the similarity of the IDD and theBDI, the IDD classi\ufb01cation of nondepressives in this study was comparable to thatused in prior studies (e.g., Andersen et al, 1992), but \u2018\u2018caseness\u2019\u2019 in major depressionmade the present depressed participants different from those in related prior stud-ies.5The study included 20 participants qualifying for a diagnosis of major depressionand 17 nondepressives, with a mean IDD score of 35.6 in major depression ( SD/H110059.7; range /H1100523\u201359), equivalent to a BDI score of 27 (excluding \u2018\u2018caseness\u2019\u2019), and4.5 in the nondepressed group ( SD/H110054.0; range /H110050\u201311), equivalent to a BDI scoreof 3.5.In the microcomputer-based experiment, participants were asked to makejudgments about whether or not each of various positive or negative future eventswas likely to happen to them or to the average student. In addition, both depressedand nondepressed participants were randomly assigned to a concurrent attentional5DSM-III criteria specify that either dysphoric mood (de\ufb01ned as sad mood, irritability, or hopelessness)or anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities) must be present for a diagnosis of MajorDepression. DSM-IV requires either dysphoric mood or anhedonia, but not hopelessness or irritability.Thus, the scoring algorithm for the IDD was modi\ufb01ed so that items indexing dysphoria, sad mood, oranhedonia were consistent with DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode (Goldston et al., 1990;Zimmerman and Coryell, 1994).Future-Event Schemas 317load condition or to a no-load condition within which they made these predictions(modeled after Andersen et al., 1992; Bargh & Tota, 1988). Afterward, all partici-pants completed a questionnaire about rumination.Instrument for Assessing DepressionThe IDD (Zimmerman & Coryell, 1987) is a self-report measure that assessesthe symptoms of major depression and their duration so as to identify cases ofmajor depression according to DSM-IV. To meet criteria for Major DepressiveDisorder, respondents must endorse at least \ufb01ve items from nine symptom clustersand must indicate having had all symptoms for at least 2 weeks. Endorsed itemsmust also have a clinical severity of at least 2 on a scale of 0\u20134 or at least 3 forloss of interest or loss of pleasure (see below).The IDD contains 22 items, each covering one symptom using \ufb01ve relevantself-statements arranged in order of severity, modeled after the Beck DepressionInventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961). Respondentsare asked to pick the statement that best describes how they have felt over thepast week. The IDD diagnoses Major Depressive Disorder according to DSM-IV. Although it was originally designed in accordance with DSM-III (AmericanPsychiatric Association, 1980), a simple change in the scoring algorithm enablesDSM-IV diagnosis.6Each item yields a score ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 representingno disturbance, 1 representing subclinical severity, and 2 or above representingclinical severity. Scores are summed to yield a total ranging from 0 to 88. (Eachitem on the BDI can range in severity from 0 to 3, and the measure yields a totalscore ranging from 0 to 63; Beck et al., 1979.) Importantly, the duration of eachsymptom is also measured, which is the main innovation that enables assessmentof \u2018\u2018caseness\u2019\u2019 in qualifying for a diagnosis of major depression. That is, respondentsindicate whether or not the symptom has been present for more than 2 weeks. Inaddition, we employed the caution of including only participants who remainedstable in their depression classi\ufb01cation between the initial assessment and the endof the experiment (as suggested by Vredenburg et al., 1993; see also, e.g., Deardoff &Funabiki, 1985; Kendall, Hollon, Beck, Hammen, & Ingram, 1987; Kendall & In-gram, 1989; Tennen, Hall, & Af\ufb02eck, 1995).The IDD has excellent validity and reliability in mixed inpatient psychiatricsamples (Zimmerman et al., 1986) and in community samples (Zimmerman &Coryell, 1987, 1988). Studies comparing the IDD with structured clinical interviewsin diagnosing major depression have found high rates of agreement (Zimmerman &Coryell, 1987, 1994). Comparing diagnoses derived from the IDD and from theDiagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, Helzer, Croughan, & Ratcliff, 1981)in a large community sample ( n/H11005394), the overall rate of agreement was 97.2 %6The highest score possible for an item on the BDI is 3, whereas for the IDD it is 4. On a separatetopic, we calculated the IDD cutoff score for nondepressed participants using the number of highestpossible scores allowable while remaining in the category. In prior work (e.g., Andersen, 1990; Andersenet al., 1992), 8 was the cutoff for nondepression (three scores of 3, minus a score of 1). On the IDD,this translates to a score of 11 (three scores of 4, minus a score of 1).318 Andersen and Limpert(Zimmerman & Coryell, 1987). For participants who completed the IDD within 1week of the DIS ( n/H11005211), agreement increased to 98.1 %, and the IDD showedhigh sensitivity in yielding true positives (80.0 %, 4 of 5 cases) and high speci\ufb01cityin yielding true negatives (98.5 %, 203 of 206 cases). Hence, the IDD is clearly avalid measure of major depression.The IDD has been used with increasing frequency in recent years (e.g.,Franche & Dobson, 1992; Goethe & Fischer, 1995; Hill & Knowles, 1991; McFarlane,Bellissimo, & Norman, 1995; Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow, 1991; Prud\u2019homme &Barron, 1992; Schlager, Froom, & Jaffe, 1995; Scott & O\u2019Hara, 1993; Veiel, 1993;Williamson & Yates, 1989). It has been shown to be a stable, internally consistent,valid measure of depressive symptomatology among college students. Based on alarge sample ( n/H110052,079) of undergraduates (Goldston, O\u2019Hara, & Schartz, 1990),the split-half reliability was .86 and Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .84. A subset of 57 studentscompleting the IDD a second time 48 hr later showed a test\u2013retest reliability of.92. A subset of 265 students completing the IDD 14 weeks later showed a test\u2013retestreliability of .56. Importantly, a subset of 30 students took part in a comparison ofIDD diagnoses and diagnoses derived from the Schedule for Affective Disordersand Schizophrenia (SADS; Endicott & Spitzer, 1978) modi\ufb01ed for DSM-III-R(American Psychiatric Association, 1987), showing overall agreement of 86.7 %(kappa /H11005.67), sensitivity of 70 %, and speci\ufb01city of 95.0 %.In addition, the prevalence rate of major depression using the IDD has beenestimated to be 5.4 %for men and 5.6 %for women in this college population(Goldston et al., 1990), substantially lower than the 9\u201320 %prevalence estimatesof depression based on other self-report measures (Boyd & Weissman, 1981), andcomparable to epidemiologic data on the 6-month prevalence estimates for majordepression of 1.1\u20133.9 %for men and 3.0\u20136.1 %for women aged 18\u201324 years (Meyerset al., 1984). Thus, the IDD provides for a relatively accurate prevalence estimateof depression relative to other self-report inventories (Goldston et al., 1990; seealso Coyne, 1994). Indeed, in the present study, of 1,298 students assessed in masstesting, 45 were classi\ufb01ed as having major depression, yielding a prevalence rateof 3.47 %, a rate comparable to that reported using interview measures. Moreover,of the 26 participants with major depression in the battery who agreed to participatein the experiment, only 17 remained depressed at the time of the experiment,suggesting our dual assessment criteria excluded participants whose depression wasmore \ufb02eeting.Apparatus and MaterialsThirty-two positive and negative future events (see Table I) were used asexperimental stimuli, all rated by college students as moderately likely to be experi-enced by the average person (Andersen et al., 1992). Exceptionally likely andunlikely positive and negative events that would yield yes and no responses, respec-tively, with little variance were also included as \ufb01llers. All participants were exposedto the same set of future events, and equal numbers of positive and negative stimulithat were moderately likely, highly likely, or highly unlikely were randomly paired,Future-Event Schemas 319Table I.

That is, the order of the target person judged (self vs. other), of event valence,and of speci\ufb01c items was completely randomized to ensure that participants wouldnot develop any target expectancies that might arti\ufb01cially reduce response times(Bargh & Tota, 1988). As indicated, participants pressed yes or no on a responsebox for each future event while the computer automatically recorded both responsecontent (yes or no) and latency (in milliseconds). In the attentional load condition,a microphone was placed on the table, ostensibly to record participants as theyrepeated aloud each random six-digit number, while the experimenter actually kepttrack of digit-response accuracy. Each future event was presented only once toeach participant.ProcedureExperimental InstructionsParticipants took part individually, and were told that they would be askedwhether or not a given event was likely to happen to them or to the average NYUundergraduate at some time in the future and that they should respond yes or noas quickly as possible while also responding as accurately as possible. Indeed, toprevent a speed\u2013accuracy tradeoff, we also informed participants that we weremore interested in the accuracy of each response than in its speed. Participants inthe attentional load condition were told that, before each trial, a random six-digitnumber would appear on the screen that they would be asked to hold in mindwhile making each judgment and to say aloud into the microphone after each trial.Participants assigned to the no-load condition simply made each judgment withoutholding such a digit in mind.320 Andersen and LimpertEach trial began with the message \u2018\u2018NEXT TRIAL FOLLOWS,\u2019\u2019 which ap-peared on the computer monitor for 1 sec. After a delay of 1 sec, a prompt appearedcentered near the top of the screen. In the attentional load condition, the promptsaid \u2018\u2018REMEMBER THESE DIGITS,\u2019\u2019 and after a 1-sec delay, a random six-digitnumber was presented and remained on the screen for 2 sec. The screen was thencleared, there was another 1-sec delay, and the regular presentation of the trialoccurred (to be described below). Once the participant responded yes or no, therewas another 1-sec delay followed by the message \u2018\u2018SAY THE 6-DIGIT NUMBERALOUD NOW.\u2019\u2019 The participant was then given 4 sec to repeat the six-digit numberbefore the next trial.For all participants, each judgment was preceded by one of two prompts, \u2018\u2018ISTHIS LIKELY TO HAPPEN TO YOU?\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018IS THIS LIKELY TO HAPPENTO THE AVERAGE NYU STUDENT?\u2019\u2019 After 1 sec, the future event to bejudged appeared. Participants responded by pressing yes or no, which terminatedthe display. After another 1 sec, the next trial began.The experimenter was blind to participants\u2019 depression status throughoutthe experiment.Accuracy of Digit RecallTo ensure that depressed and nondepressed participants in the attentional loadcondition did not differentially take their attention away from the digit task inmaking their judgments, the accuracy of participants\u2019 memory for the six digits theyheld in mind during each trial was examined. For each of the 64 trials, digit-recallinaccuracy ranged from 6 (all six digits recalled incorrectly) to 0 (no digit recalledincorrectly). Analysis of the average number of errors participants made across alltrials showed that there were no signi\ufb01cant differences between nondepressed anddepressed participants. The mean number of errors was 1.17 for nondepressivesand 0.93 for major depressives, F(1,15)/H110211.Second Diagnostic AssessmentFollowing all trials, participants again \ufb01lled out the IDD to verify their depres-sion group classi\ufb01cation.Rumination QuestionnaireParticipants then completed a measure of future-event rumination, based ona negative life event, created for the present research. The measure asked partici-pants to report the most negative life event that had happened to them within thelast 2 weeks , a period corresponding to the time during which we assessed depression(the same 2-week period), and to rate the negativity of that event. As an index offuture-event rumination, we asked participants to rate three items tapping howmuch the event had led them to ruminate about the future, how much it had ledto intrusive thoughts about the future, and how intense their thoughts were. Wealso assessed rumination about the self by asking participants to rate the same threequestions about rumination about the self, the extent to which the event had ledFuture-Event Schemas 321them to wonder and think about what kind of person they are, and the intrusivenessand intensity of the thoughts. These latter factors are important in ruminativeprocesses (Tait and Silver, 1989). All items were rated on 8-point scales.To verify the notion that our separate rumination questions, about futureand self, meaningfully captured these respective constructs, we conducted a factoranalysis of these six items using varimax rotation. As predicted, two factors emerged,the \ufb01rst including the three items related to the self, with factor loadings of .77 orhigher (a factor accounting for 43.7 %of the variance), and the second includingthe three items related to the future, with factor loadings of .68 or higher (afactor accounting for 38.0 %of the variance). Hence, future-event rumination andrumination about the self were examined as separate composite measures.Ethical IssuesBased on prior work in this area, we assumed that the effects of schemaactivation among depressives in this study would be minimal and transient. Nonethe-less, a trained doctoral student in clinical psychology served as the experimenterin every session and was poised to detect and respond to any mood changes thatmight be evident (none were). Moreover, a department-wide decision was madeto exclude any student from the study who scored high on suicidality, while makinga referral to a clinical psychologist for evaluation and treatment. We followed thisprocedure at both administration times. However, no student reported suicidalityor showed increases in depression in the experiment to warrant such action. Finally,we were instructed by our university human subjects committee not to discuss inour debrie\ufb01ng the preselection of participants for depression, so as not to triggerproblematic issues for participants. We complied with this request.RESULTSResponse LatenciesBefore analyzing for automaticity, raw response latencies were trimmed sothat any data points that were three standard deviations above the overall meanwere treated as outliers, as is standard procedure in reaction-time analyses due toskew in these distributions (Ratcliff, 1993). This removed a small proportion ofdata points greater than 7818 msec for each participant, an inordinate amount oftime to make this type of judgment, which would have otherwise introduced effortin our assessment of automaticity.Participants\u2019 average response latency to predict events of each valence forself or other was examined in a 2 /H110032/H110032/H110032 (Depression /H11003Load/H11003EventValence /H11003Self/Other) analysis of variance (ANOVA) with two repeated measures.We predicted greater relative automaticity (i.e., smaller increases in response latencydue to load) among depressed participants than among nondepressed participants.If valence plays no role, the analysis should yield a two-way interaction betweendepression and load, and if it is relevant, a three-way interaction should emerge322 Andersen and Limpertinvolving event valence, and our contrasts should show that the load/no-load differ-ence is smaller among depressives than among nondepressives.The omnibus analysis yielded a reliable main effect for load, F(1,33)/H110057.67,p/H11005.01, as expected, indicating longer latencies under load ( M/H110052774 msec) thanunder no load ( M/H110051902 msec). This shows that dual-task interference was in factintroduced. This analysis also yielded a main effect for valence, F(1,33)/H1100537.15,p/H11021.0001, indicating that, on average, predictions about positive events were mademore quickly ( M/H110052073 msec) than were predictions about negative events ( M/H110052534 msec).Turning to our main hypothesis, the two-way interaction between depressionand load did not emerge, F(1,33)/H110051.08, p/H11005.31. The analysis did, however, yieldthe same three-way interaction between depression, load, and event valence thatemerged in prior work using this paradigm (Andersen et al., 1992), although it wasmarginally signi\ufb01cant, F(1,33)/H110053.39, p/H11005.08. Planned contrasts were conductednonetheless to examine our speci\ufb01c predictions.7As predicted, and as portrayed inFig. 1, the load/no-load difference in response latency was relatively smaller amongparticipants with major depression than among nondepressed participants. Thatis, for predictions about negative events, depressives showed smaller increases inresponse latency due to load ( M/H11005445) than did nondepressives ( M/H110051381),t(33)/H110053.61, p/H11021.001 ( d/H110051.19), and the same effect held for positive events(major depression, M/H11005645; no depression, M/H110051017), t(33)/H110051.61, p/H11021.06,although the latter was marginal ( d/H11005.53). (All reported contrasts are a priori andhence one-tailed.) This pattern of \ufb01ndings emerged with a medium to large effectsize, and because automaticity is typically conceptualized in relative terms (Bargh,1989, 1994), examining the degree to which automaticity is present in one groupof participants relative to another for a given type of judgment makes sense. Whenjudgments are made relatively automatically by a set of participants, the introductionof an attentional load condition should increase latencies relatively less than it doesfor the same judgments made by other participants. Hence, our evidence for alesser magnitude in the load/no-load difference among participants with majordepression relative to nondepressives is meaningful and suggests relatively moreautomaticity in making future-event predictions in major depression.Pessimism/Optimism in Yes\u2013No ResponsesContent of Future-E vent RepresentationsIn conjunction with our main hypotheses concerning automaticity, it is impor-tant to examine the extent of self-reported pessimism in participants\u2019 positive andnegative future-event predictions. To do this, we analyzed participants\u2019 yes\u2013noresponses to the various future events they judged, comparing the mean number7In calculating these contrasts, we did not use the error term for the depression /H11003load/H11003event typeinteraction in this mixed-model design, as would be acceptable in a complete between-subjects factorialdesign. In a mixed-model design, this error term does not accurately estimate the error variance pertinentto the within-participant factor (i.e., furture-event valence). Therefore, we conducted separate analysesfor positive events and for negative event to obtain the proper error term for each such contrast.Future-Event Schemas 323Fig. 1. Difference between the load and no-load conditions in response latency to make predictionsabout positive and negative future events by participants\u2019 depression classi\ufb01cation.of yes responses to each type of event in the same 2 /H110032/H110032/H110032 ANOVA. Theanalysis yielded a marginal main effect for depression, F(1,33)/H110053.87, p/H11005.058,quali\ufb01ed by the predicted interaction between depression and event valence,F(1,33)/H110057.73, p/H11021.01, as portrayed in Fig. 2. Planned contrasts indicated, in fact,that participants with major depression said yes to fewer positive events ( M/H110055.39)than did nondepressed participants ( M/H110057.09), t(33)/H110052.16, p/H11021.05 ( d/H11005.86),and unlike prior results (Andersen et al., 1992), no reliable difference betweengroups in response to negative events (nondepressed, M/H110053.85, depressed, M/H110054.34, t/H110211;d/H11005.21). These data suggest a lack of optimism in the participants withmajor depression in this study rather than pessimism per se. That is, the contentof future-event predictions in major depression appears to be de\ufb01ned by the anticipa-tion of fewer positive events than nondepressives anticipate.The omnibus ANOVA also yielded other reliable \ufb01ndings. First, there was amain effect for event valence, F(1,33)/H1100529.61, p/H11021.0001, such that, on average,participants predicted more positive ( M/H110056.18) than negative events ( M/H110054.12),although this \ufb01nding was quali\ufb01ed by the interaction. Second, it yielded a maineffect for the self\u2013other factor, F(1,33)/H1100513.62, p/H11021.001, which itself was quali\ufb01edby an interaction between this factor and event valence, F(1,33)/H1100521.79, p/H11021.0001.The latter indicated that participants predicted fewer negative events for themselves324 Andersen and LimpertFig. 2. Average number of yes responses to positive and negative future events by participants\u2019depression classi\ufb01cation.(M/H110053.14) than for others ( M/H110055.11). These additional \ufb01ndings do not compromiseour central comparisons concerning depressives versus nondepressives.Relevance of Yes\u2013No Responses to the Interpretation ofResponse-Latency AnalysesThe analysis of participants\u2019 yes\u2013no responses showed no reliable interactionsbetween load and other factors ( Fs/H110211) nor a main effect for load, which generallyallows one to interpret response latency differences between the load and no-loadconditions in terms of automaticity (see Andersen et al., 1992).RuminationGiven our interest in ruminative thought processes, participants\u2019 rating of eachrumination item was examined in a 2 /H110032 (Depression /H11003Load) ANOVA. (Nodifferences between major depressives and nondepressed participants were foundin the perceived negativity of the life event reported for this rumination measure,which equates participants on this variable, F/H110211.)Future-Event Schemas 325Rumination About the Future and the SelfUsing a composite re\ufb02ecting rumination about the future (with high interitemreliability across the three items, alpha /H11005.90), the results showed that participantswith major depression reported reliably more rumination about the future basedon the negative event they listed ( M/H110055.40) than did nondepressives ( M/H110053.08),F(1,33)/H1100514.21, p/H11021.001. Using a composite re\ufb02ecting rumination about the self(again with high internal reliability, alpha /H11005.96), participants with major depressionalso reported more rumination about themselves based on the event ( M/H110054.87)than did nondepressives ( M/H110051.93), F(1,33)/H1100518.86, p/H11021.001. Hence, in majordepression there was more rumination both about the future and about the selfthan with nondepressed participants. In conjunction with our evidence showinggreater automaticity in the future-event predictions among major depressives rela-tive to nondepressives, these data provide evidence that rumination both about thefuture and about the self cooccurs with automaticity in future-event predictions.Does Rumination About the Future Account for Future-E ventAutomaticity in Depression?Automatic future-event predictions among major depressives should be non-strategic, and self-reported rumination should thus notaccount for such effects. Toexplore whether or not self-reported rumination might account for the effects, weconducted the response-latency analysis again controlling for rumination about thefuture. Hence, the comparable analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conductedusing a future-event\u2013rumination composite as a covariate. This ANCOVA yieldedessentially the same results. That is, it showed the main effects for load, F(1,32)/H110059.06, p/H11021.01, and event valence, F(1,32)/H110054.95, p/H11021.05, and the three-wayinteraction between depression, load, and event valence, F(1,32)/H110053.13, p/H11005.08.Thus, rumination about the future does not appear to account for the relativeautomaticity in the future-event predictions of depressives versus nondepressives.DISCUSSIONOur central hypothesis in this research was con\ufb01rmed, in that participantswith major depression showed relati vely greater automaticity in their future-e ventpredictions than did nondepressives. Speci\ufb01cally, these depressed participantsshowed smaller increases in response latency under attentional load (relative tono-load) for both positive and negative events than did nondepressives. Indeed,their future-event predictions were also less optimistic than were those of nonde-pressives, in that these individuals were less likely to predict that positive eventswould occur, although equally likely to predict that negative events would not,suggesting no explicit pessimism in this sample. Moreover, and again as predicted,participants with major depression showed more rumination about the future thandid nondepressives. Overall, the \ufb01ndings conceptually replicate evidence aboutautomaticity in future-event predictions found among moderate depressives326 Andersen and Limpert(Andersen et al., 1992) and extend it to major depression, while linking it withfuture-event rumination.The data suggest future-e vent schemas among people with major depressionthat enable relati vely effortless future-e vent predictions . By contrast, nondepressivesappear not to possess a well-developed knowledge structure concerning futureoutcomes, suggesting that such schemas are unique to depression. The data thusindicate that this element of Beck\u2019s (1967) negative cognitive triad is also repre-sented schematically in memory. These \ufb01ndings also contribute to research onautomatic thoughts in major depression, by measuring automaticity in future-eventspredictions. Although automatic thoughts are considered crucial in depression, theirautomatic nature has tended not to be examined (Segal, 1988; although see, e.g.,Andersen et al., 1992; Bargh & Tota, 1988; Hartlage et al., 1993; Segal et al., 1998).Our design assessed relatively effortless processing using a dual-task attentionalload paradigm that allowed us largely to rule out the role of strategic, effortfulcognitive processing in future-event predictions.To establish the connection between future-event automaticity and ongoingruminative processes, we examined rumination about the future, and predicted thatparticipants with major depression would report more future-event rumination thanwould nondepressives. This prediction was con\ufb01rmed, suggesting that ruminationabout the future on the basis of recent negative life events cooccurs with relativeautomaticity in future-event predictions among major depressives, extending theliteratures on automaticity, schematicity, and rumination in depression.Broadly speaking, our results for major depression are consistent with thoseobtained for moderate depressives (Andersen et al., 1992), but some discrepanciesare worth noting. In the current study, we obtained signi\ufb01cant latency differencesbetween the load and no-load conditions for both positive and negative events notonly among nondepressed participants, but even among depressives. By contrast,these differences did not reach signi\ufb01cance among moderate depressives in the priorwork (Andersen et al., 1992), and the prior work thus offered a more \u2018\u2018absolute\u2019\u2019demonstration of automaticity among moderate depressives than did the presentstudy among individuals with major depression.The notion that automaticity in the future-event predictions of major de-pressives, or in their future-event schemas, might be less robust than that amongmoderate depressives is counterintuitive. Less schematicity in the future-event rep-resentations of major depressives relative to moderate depressives would seem tobe the opposite of what should be expected if increased severity is associated withfuture-event schematicity. Automaticity in future-event predictions, however, maynot emerge quite so linearly as being a simple function of severity. Rather, automa-ticity may represent a kind of set point that is reached in the course of depression,a set point occurring even among those who are moderately depressed, implyingthat it exists in major depression as well, but does not begin there. Indeed, itsassessment in major depression may be interfered with by other factors. Qualitativedifferences among moderate and more serious depression, such as psychomotorretardation or lowered motivation, may alter manifestations of automaticity in thelatter group. That is, the constellation of symptoms associated with major depressionmay lead to dif\ufb01culties in focusing on the task at hand (Hertel & Hardin, 1990).Future-Event Schemas 327The major depressives in the present study indeed showed longer raw latenciesthan the moderate depressives in prior work (Andersen et al., 1992). Indeed, seriousdepression may itself place a considerable demand on cognitive processes (Hartlageet al., 1993).The present study of course differed from prior work on future-event schemas(Andersen et al., 1992) in the methods used to classify participants into depressiongroups. Whereas prior work used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck etal., 1961), we used the Inventory to Diagnose Depression (IDD; Zimmerman etal., 1986) and included only participants qualifying for major depression, that is,those reporting a relevant constellation of symptoms for at least 2 weeks, bothbefore the experiment and afterward. Hence, the present study examined \u2018\u2018caseness\u2019\u2019classi\ufb01cation\u2014major depression or not\u2014in a manner stable across two administra-tion times separated by anywhere from 2 to 22 weeks. This means that the de-pressives in this study were more severely impaired than prior participants in thecomparable design (Andersen et al., 1992). Nonetheless, the data demonstraterelati vely greater automaticity among these major depressives than among controls.Although we cannot de\ufb01nitively rule out the possibility that future-event schemasare less operative in major depression than in moderate depression, indications inthe literature would suggest that other factors are likely to have interfered with itseffective assessment among participants with major depression.On a different note, prior work (Andersen et al., 1992) found more pessimismin moderate depressives than in nondepressives in two ways, both in predictingfewer positive events and in predicting more negative events. The present studyshowed that people with major depression predicted only fewer positi veevents andnot more negative events, a pattern of \ufb01ndings that was unpredicted and hence anyaccount of it must remain speculative. This \ufb01nding is provocative, however, becausethe valence of anticipated outcomes is central to theoretical frameworks relevantto depression, such as self-discrepancy theory (Higgins, 1987). In that theory, theabsence of positive outcomes is of special relevance to depression because positiveoutcomes and their withdrawal are crucial to ideal-self/actual-self discrepancies andsuch discrepancies are associated with depression (see Higgins, 1987). Althoughour model argues that depression is associated with pessimism and future-eventautomaticity, it is silent on different patterns based on the positivity or negativityof the anticipated event. Self-discrepancy theory, by contrast, provides reason tobelieve that this effect may be meaningful, and the data may thus contribute to theself-discrepancy literature as well.Similarly, the present results are also broadly consistent with cognitive\u2013mediational theories of emotion (e.g., Beck, 1974; Lazarus & Averill, 1972), whichconceptualize depressive affect as resulting from the appraisal of loss of a valuedoutcome. These models again support the idea that the loss of positive outcomesmay be central in the anticipation of future events in depression (see also Brown &Harris, 1978; Oatley & Bolton, 1985). The fact that no such pattern emerged formoderate depressives in prior work, but did among major depressives in the presentwork, suggests that major depression may be more likely to involve loss and a lackof all hope.As indicated, individuals with major depression in this study experienced more328 Andersen and Limpertruminative thoughts related to the future, based on their own bad experiences, thandid nondepressives, an effect that cooccurred with evidence about future-eventschemas in major depression. This \ufb01nding lends support to our overall frameworkwhich suggests that depression can be viewed in terms of a time course beginningwith strategic, effortful rumination about the future based on negative events andmild depression, then continued elaboration and rehearsal, and \ufb01nally depression,as the process of making future-event predictions becomes relatively routinized.The practice effects associated with strategic rumination should lead to the onsetof automaticity, so that rumination is no longer deliberate, but rather is experiencedas involuntary (Andersen et al., 1992; see also Andersen, 1990; Andersen &Schwartz, 1992). A clear demonstration of this precise pattern would require alongitudinal design in which depression, rumination, and automaticity in future-event predictions are assessed over time, with strategic rumination at one point intime accounting for automaticity in future-event predictions at a later point intime, all as part of increasing severity in depression. The present research was notlongitudinal and it did not yield an index of automaticity calculated for each subjectthat could be examined in direct relation to our (between-participant) index ofrumination, which compared load and no-load participants. Although this precludedany test of the potential mediating role of rumination (as a kind of practice) in theformation of future-event schemas, the data nonetheless provide support for thehypothesis that both future-event schemas and future-event rumination are opera-tive in major depression.It is also worth noting that depressives in the current study showed greaterrumination than did nondepressives not only about the future, but also about theself. A recent negative life event led them to experience more ruminative thoughtsabout the self than did nondepressives, just as they did about the future. This isconsistent with work suggesting that ruminative thoughts following a negative lifeevent deal with self-evaluation (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991; Tait & Silver, 1989). Bothrumination about the self and about the future were reported more by depressivesthan by nondepressives in this study, and hence each may well be associated withschemas\u2014self-schemas and future-event schemas, respectively\u2014based on simplepractice effects (Smith, 1989, 1994), a matter that warrants future research attention.Although these \ufb01ndings are provocative and do appear to suggest that bothfuture-event schemas and rumination about the future occur among individualswith major depression, we acknowledge that the present research had limitationsthat suggest caution is warranted. First, our measure of rumination involved retro-spect reports of ruminations based on a recent life event, and thus did not tapconcurrent, ongoing rumination in the experiment. Although the rumination \ufb01nd-ings concerning future events in this research are nicely consistent with our overallhypothesis, the measure we employed did not allow us to assess directly the kindof ongoing rumination that should accompany depression, which could have enableda better test of our model.A second limitation is the very small sample size employed in this research,which is far less than ideal. Of course, our sample size was small precisely becauseof the stringent criteria we used for identifying individuals with major depression.All participants identi\ufb01ed as having major depression quali\ufb01ed for this diagnosisFuture-Event Schemas 329both in a mass testing session 3\u201311 weeks before the experiment and during theexperiment itself. This consistency/duration requirement enabled us to rule outtransient \ufb02uctuations in dysphoria of less than 1 month (since all major depressionby de\ufb01nition has lasted for at least 2 weeks). This criterion led us to classify a smallnumber of potential participants as qualifying for the study as major depressives,severely restricting our sample size. This obviously limited statistical power in thisresearch and reduced our ability to detect differences, while also being compromis-ing in other ways, suggesting that follow-up research would be useful. The mainconcern about low statistical power, however, is that it makes it less possible todetect effects that do exist, not more possible to spuriously con\ufb01rm a priori hypothe-ses. Hence, obtaining evidence for predicted effects with low power is worthy ofnote, even though caution is warranted.A third limitation is that we used a paper-and-pencil self-report measure todetermine the presence or absence of major depression, which arguably providesa less precise measure of \u2018\u2018caseness\u2019\u2019 in major depression than use of a standardstructured-interview measure would have because careful follow-up questions makesuch interviews the current \u2018\u2018gold standard\u2019\u2019 in psychiatric diagnosis. On the otherhand, the consistency between the measure we employed and standard interviewprocedures for diagnosing major depression has been shown to be very high, as wehave described (see Method). Hence, although the measure we used is clearlyimperfect, it has very high validity in diagnosing major depression.Finally, there is the limiting condition in this research that we examined onlyuniversity students (in an ethnically diverse urban setting). Because of our exactingcriteria for qualifying for a diagnosis of major depression, many of the problemsof studies among college students are to an extent overcome, of course, and theuse of \u2018\u2018caseness\u2019\u2019 in major depression extends prior work among college students,who differ from a random sample, at minimum, by being largely in late adolescence/early adulthood and quali\ufb01ed, motivated, and \ufb01nancially able to attend a university.In sum, given numerous criticisms of research on studies of subclinical depres-sion, our examination of future-event schemas among people with major depressionin the current study (even if from a college-student population) represents animportant advance over prior work on future-event schemas (Andersen et al., 1992).Moreover, in demonstrating the relatively automatic nature of thoughts about thefuture in people with major depression along with rumination about the future, wehave forged a link with the literature on rumination as well. The data thus extendthe literature on automatic thoughts in major depression both into the domain offuture events and into the realm of the experimental demonstration of automaticcognitive processes. Automatic thoughts are a prime target of change in cognitivetherapy for depression, and the relatively rigid nature of depressives\u2019 thoughtsabout the future may thus be relevant for treatment. In addition, although weregard the emergence of future-event schemas as a proximal in\ufb02uence on depressionand assume that they may decay or become chronically deactivated by inhibitoryprocesses when depression remits, we also speculate that future-event schemasmight instead become latent among remitted depressives and may thus serve as avulnerability factor in relapse if effectively triggered by life circumstances, mattersworthy of research attention.330 Andersen and LimpertACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe research was funded in part by a grant from the National Institute ofMental Health (R01-MH48789).
