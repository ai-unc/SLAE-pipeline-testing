Andersen’? and Christie Limpert’\n\nWe examined the proposition that individuals with major depression make predictions\nabout future events relatively automatically and pessimistically, reflecting use of a\nfuture-event schema, while they also ruminate about the future. Depressed participants\nand nondepressed controls indicated whether or not various positive and negative\nfuture events would happen to them or to an average other— either under a concurrent\nattentional load or no such load—while their response latencies were assessed. As\nhypothesized, depressives showed relatively greater automaticity in their predictions\nthan did nondepressives, and a lack of optimism as well. More specifically, depressives\nshowed a smaller increase in response latency due to the introduction of the attentional\nload than did nondepressives, suggesting relatively greater processing efficiency, and\nthey also predicted reliably fewer positive events. Indeed, depressives also reported\nruminating more about the future based on a recent distressing life event. Overall,\nthe results extend research on future-event schemas and automaticity (Andersen,\nSpielman, & Bargh, 1992) from moderate to major depression and establish a link\nwith future-event rumination.\n\nKEY WORDS: depression; rumination; schemas; cognition.\n\nCognitive theories of depression suggest that hopeless expectations about the\nfuture play a fundamental role in depression (e.g., Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy,\n1989; Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978; Beck, 1967, 1976). According to Beck\n(1967, pp. 256-261), a negative cognitive triad of beliefs, about the self, the world,\nand the future, plays an etiological role in depressed mood (although purely cogni-\ntive models of depression have, of course, been challenged, e.g., Coyne & Gotlib,\n1983; Haaga, Dyck, & Ernst, 1991). These three types of beliefs are interrelated\nand yet they are also conceptually distinct. One’s ideas about the future are not\nidentical to one’s views of the self, nor to one’s perceptions of the world. Indeed,\nviews about the self do not always generalize even to views about others (e.g.,\n\n\"Department of Psychology, New York University, New York, New York.\n“Correspondence should be directed to Susan M. Andersen, Department of Psychology, New York\nUniversity, 6 Washington Place, 4th Floor, New York, New York 10003.\n\n31\n\n0147-5916/01/0600-0311519.50/0 © 2001 Plenum Publishing Corporation\n\n\n312 Andersen and Limpert\n\nAlloy & Ahrens, 1987; Bargh & Tota, 1988). Hence, cognitions about the future\nand cognitions about the self cover different territory.\n\nAccording to Beck (1967, 1976), patterns of self-interpretation in depression\ncan be conceived in terms of self-schemas, mental representations of past experi-\nences and generic knowledge about the self. Indeed, much research has examined\nand demonstrated the operation of self-schemas in depression (e.g., Bargh & Tota,\n1988; Hammen, Marks, de Mayo, & Mayol, 1985; Segal, Gemar, Truchon, Guir-\nguis, & Horowitz, 1995; Segal, Hood, Shaw, & Higgins, 1988; Teasdale, Taylor,\nCooper, Hayhurst, & Paykel, 1995; Zuppan, Hammen, & Jaenicke, 1987; for reviews\nsee, Haaga et al., 1991; Segal, 1988). However, in spite of widespread acknowledg-\nment of the role of self-schemas in depression, and acceptance of the cognitive\ntriad in depression more broadly, little research has systematically examined the\noperation of other elements of the triad or the notion that schematic knowledge\nabout future events ought to exist among depressives.\n\nIn our view, the way depressives think about future events is of importance\nbecause the manner in which future events are anticipated is integral to hopelessness\n(Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, Spielman, & Bargh, 1992; Garber, Miller, &\nAbramson, 1980; Hollon & Garber, 1980). Hopelessness has been central to each\nrevision of the learned helplessness model (Abramson et al., 1978, 1989) and evi-\ndence suggests that depressives do in fact hold more pessimistic or hopeless expecta-\ntions about the future than do nondepressives, perceiving positive events as less\nlikely and negative events as more likely (Alloy & Ahrens, 1987; Andersen, 1990;\nAndersen & Schwartz, 1992; MacLeod & Cropley, 1995; Pietromonaco & Markus,\n1985; Pyszczynski, Holt, & Greenberg, 1987; Reich & Weary, in press; Riskind,\nRholes, Brannon, & Burdick, 1987).\n\nThe present research extends work on hopelessness in which this construct is\ndefined in terms of depressive predictive certainty, or the tendency to see future\nsuffering as inevitable. This work has shown a strong association between such\ndepressive predictive certainty and naturally occurring depression, in that moderate\ndepressives appear to feel certain that positive events will not occur and that negative\nevents will (Andersen, 1990; Andersen & Schwartz, 1992; see also Andersen &\nLyon, 1987). One implication is the possibility that depressives may have well-\nestablished knowledge that enables them to make quick judgments about the future\nin the form of a future-event schema.\n\nResearch on self-schemas among mild to moderate depressives has demon-\nstrated automaticity in negative judgments about the self (e.g., Bargh & Tota, 1988),\nand research has begun to address the operation of future-event schemas among\ndepressives as well. Specifically, the latter research has demonstrated that moder-\nately depressed persons (college students) show automaticity in their predictions\nabout the future, whereas nondepressed people do not (Andersen et al., 1992). In\neach case, this automatic processing involves relatively effortless judgments that\ndo not require much attention.\n\n“Schemas are generally conceptualized as well-organized, highly efficient knowledge structures that\noperate relatively effortlessley. Hence, we assume that schematic processing involves such ease in\nprocessing as one aspect of automaticity (Bargh, 1989; Bargh & Tota, 1988; Hasher & Zacks, 1979).\n\n\nFuture-Event Schemas 313\n\nMore broadly, automaticity has been shown to have multiple components,\nincluding effortlessness or efficiency, uncontrollability, unintentionality, and uncon-\nsciousness (Bargh, 1989, 1994), components that do not necessarily cooccur. Hence,\nto require a process to have all features of automaticity, rather than a particular\nfeature, would be to define it out of existence. Of course, competing models of\nautomatic processing also exist. That is, automaticity may arise based on the buildup\nof large numbers of relevant instances in memory through repeated experience and\npractice with a stimulus or procedure such that this produces a special ease of\nretrieval reflected in automatic processing (e.g., Logan, 1988; Schmidt & Bjork,\n1992; Smith, 1989, 1994). By contrast, automaticity may be based on limits in\nattentional capacity that favor judgments based on recently or frequently used\nmental representations (e.g., Bargh, 1989; Higgins & Bargh, 1987; Kahneman, 1973).\nRegardless, the general notion shared by these competing models is that automatic\nprocesses involve a relatively rapid, effortless ease of retrieval and use of stored\nknowledge (procedural or declarative). Automatic cognitive processes should thus\noccur unabated in spite of other tasks requiring attention that must be performed\nsimultaneously (in a dual-task paradigm), and there should be a continuum of such\nautomaticity rather than it being all-or-none. Prior research on future-event schemas\namong depressives has assessed relatively effortless processing (Andersen et al.,\n1992), as did the present research.\n\nIn previous research on future-event schemas, participants were asked to make\nyes—no judgments about whether or not various positive and negative events would\nhappen either to them or to an average other, while their response latencies were\nassessed, and they did this task either under a concurrent attentional load or no\nsuch load. The results showed that these moderately depressed participants were\nmore pessimistic in that they predicted fewer positive events and more negative\nevents than did either mild depressives or nondepressives. They also made their\nfuture-event predictions with greater automaticity, overall, as defined in terms of\neffortlessness in processing. That is, introducing the attentional load did not reliably\nincrease depressives’ response latencies in predicting future events (whether positive\nor negative), whereas the introduction of the attentional load did reliably increase\nthe response latencies of both mild depressives and nondepressives (again for both\npositive and negative future events). Such evidence provides a clear demonstration\nof automaticity in the future-event predictions of moderate depressives.*\n\nThis evidence thus suggests that moderate depressives possess a future-event\nschema—a well-defined set of expectations about the future that are relatively\npessimistic—enabling especially efficient processing of information about the future\n(Andersen et al., 1992; Reich & Weary, in press). By contrast, both nondepressives\n\n“The assessment of response latency in such a dual-task paradigm allows for assessment of effortlessness\nas an element of automatic processing (Bargh, 1989, 1994). Tasks that proceed relatively effortlessly\nshould not show interference effects based on an attentional load. That is, they should show less\ninterference than do tasks that require effort. If a process requires little attention or effort, it should\nbe less affected by an attention-demanding task (Andersen et al., 1992). This is the case because\naccessibility and ease in use of particular representations should not be driven by strategic processing,\nand should be relatively effortless and relatively undemanding of attention. A dual-task paradigm of\nthis kind is thus useful in assessing relative processing ease or effortlessness regardless of which model\nof automaticity is adopted (Kantowitz, 1974; Logan, 1979).\n\n\n314 Andersen and Limpert\n\nand mild depressives appear not to hold a schematized view of the future. In fact,\nnondepressives appear to be quite uncertain of the future and not in the least\nschematized, quite appropriate given that the future is unknown. That is, although\nself-schemas exist both for depressives and for nondepressives, differing largely in\ncontent (Bargh & Tota, 1988; although see Higgins, Van Hook, & Dorfman, 1988),\nonly depressives schematically organize future-event knowledge in memory; nonde-\npressives do not.\n\nOur assumption is that a mental structure enabling automatic future-event\npredictions is formed among depressives on the basis of the well-practiced process\nof attempting to anticipate and predict future events (Andersen et al., 1992; Reich &\nWeary, in press), and our approach is thus most consistent with a practice-effects\nview of automaticity (Logan, 1988; Schmidt & Bjork, 1992; Smith, 1989). In this\nsense, rumination about the future should be at the root of automatic thoughts\nabout the future among depressives, through the mechanism of practice effects.\nRumination in depression is thought to involve a cascade of negative cognitions,\ncreating still more intrusive thoughts (Beck, 1967, 1976; Beck, Rush, Shaw, &\nEmery, 1979; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). Future-event schemas may thus result in\npart from relatively intentional, ruminative thought about the future based on\nnegative life events (Andersen et al., 1992), especially if depression is a course\nthat begins with increasing rumination about the future which then deepens the\ndepression and eventually enables automaticity in future-event predictions. The\nnotion that mild depressives may actually seek certainty in particular ways is sup-\nported by research on social-perception processes among depressives (Weary &\nEdwards, 1994), and rumination may seem to reduce uncertainty. Interestingly,\ndepressives who engage in rumination may do so because they believe it will help\nthem to understand themselves and solve their problems, while in fact it serves to\nmaintain or even exacerbate their depression (Lyubomirsky & Nolen-Hoeksema,\n1993; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). Although the full implications of our model could\nnot be assessed in the present research, the research does extend prior work on\nfuture-event schemas in depression and constitutes a preliminary effort to examine\nautomaticity in conjunction with rumination, all among individuals with major\ndepression.\n\nAs pessimistic ideas about the future become elaborated and well rehearsed\nthrough strategic rumination, ideas about the future should come to mind relatively\neffortlessly, in an increasingly nonreflective and involuntary way. Numerous studies\nsuggest that self-focused rumination maintains and exacerbates depression (e.g.,\nIngram, Lumry, Cruet, & Sieber, 1987; Larsen & Cowan, 1988; Musson & Alloy,\n1988; Pyszczynski, Hamilton, Herring, & Greenberg, 1989; Smith, Ingram, & Roth,\n1985). When depressives ruminate, they show increases in depression in both corre-\nlational studies (Nolen-Hoeksema, Morrow, & Fredrickson, 1993) and experimental\nstudies (Lyubomirsky & Nolen-Hoeksema, 1993, 1995; Nolen-Hoeksema & Mor-\nrow, 1993). However, they show less depression when they engage in distraction,\nwhereas among nondepressives, neither rumination nor distraction has these af-\nfective impacts.\n\nIn addition, both laboratory and naturalistic studies have shown that de-\npressives are especially likely to ruminate, and, perhaps as part of this, that they\n\n\nFuture-Event Schemas 315\n\ncome to express more negative expectations about the future, endorse more negative\ninterpretations of events, and give more self-defeating explanations for negative\nevents (e.g., Gibbons et al., 1985; Nolen-Hoeksema, Parker, & Larson, 1994; Pyszc-\nzynski et al., 1987, 1989). More broadly, a strong, positive relationship has been\nshown between rumination and depression severity and duration, giving evidence\nof the importance of rumination in depression (Morrow & Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990;\nNolen-Hoeksema, 1991; Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1993, 1994).\n\nIn the present research, we extended research on future-event schemas among\nmoderate depressives into the realm of major depression, and examined future-\nevent rumination as well. We used an assessment tool enabling DSM-IV diagnosis of\nmajor depression (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), and randomly assigned\ndepressed participants and controls to an attentional load or no-load condition in\nwhich they made yes or no predictions about a variety of positive and negative\nfuture events either concerning the self or concerning an average other (Andersen\net al., 1992). Our design and our measurement of response latency enabled us to\nstudy the process by which future-event judgments are made by people with major\ndepression, that is, its relative automaticity as defined in terms of effortlessness.\nThis extends beyond the simple yes or no content of such judgments, and in general\nbeyond self-reported “automatic thoughts,” which index pessimism rather than on-\nline processing (Segal, 1988; see also Hartlage, Alloy, Vazquez, & Dykman, 1993).\n\nIn this work, we hypothesized that individuals with major depression would\nshow relatively more automaticity in their future-event predictions than would\nnondepressives. This would be shown if the increase in latency due to load (versus\nno load) in making future-event predictions was smaller for depressives than for\nnondepressives. We thus predicted this effect in response latency for predictions\nabout both positive and negative events. Practice in making future-event predictions\nshould lead to a special ease of retrieval of future-event information and of prior\npredictions among depressives due to a buildup of instances of practice in attempting\nto predict the future (see also Logan, 1988; Smith, 1989, 1994). Hence, relatively\ngreater automaticity should be found among individuals with major depression.\nSuch evidence would directly demonstrate “automatic thoughts” about the future\nin major depression and would suggest relatively more use of future-event schemas\nas well. Of course, we also predicted relatively greater pessimism in the yes-no\nresponses of participants in predicting positive or negative events, as in prior work.\nGreater rumination based on a negative life event was also predicted. Moreover,\nthe potential cooccurrence of rumination and future-event automaticity in major\ndepression would provide further grist for the speculation that ruminative processes\nmay underlie the formation of future-event schemas.\n\nMETHOD\n\nParticipants and Overview\n\nCollege students with major depression were selected from a diverse population\nof undergraduates at an urban university, in accordance with the DSM-IV specifica-\n\n\n316 Andersen and Limpert\n\ntions (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), by means of their scores on a\nvalidated instrument to diagnose major depression (Zimmerman, Coryell, Coren-\nthal, & Wilson, 1986). Thirty-seven undergraduates (22 females, 15 males) enrolled\nin an introductory psychology course participated in partial fulfillment of a course\nrequirement. They ranged in age from 18 to 26 years with a mean age of 19.4 years\nand were 65% (24) White, 22% (8) Asian American, 5% (2) African American, 5%\n(2) Hispanic, and 3% (1) Native American.\n\nAlthough research on depression conducted with college students has evoked\ncontroversy because of questionable applicability to major depression (for reviews,\nsee Coyne, 1994; Coyne & Gotlib, 1983; Gotlib, 1984; Vredenburg, Flett, & Krames,\n1993), we carefully preselected for individuals with major depression in the present\nstudy. Depressives were preselected on the basis of their scores on the Inventory\nto Diagnose Depression (IDD; Zimmerman et al., 1986), administered as part of\na mass testing session prior to the experiment, and readministered at the end of\nthe experiment, from 2 to 22 weeks later, with an average of 9 weeks elapsing, to\nensure that all depressed participants remained clearly classifiable as “cases” of\nmajor depression in the experiment. As this implies, participants with major depres-\nsion are likely to have been symptomatic for at least 1 month and up to 6 months\nand not likely to have been subsyndromal. Although we cannot rule out dysthymic\ndisorder among these participants, this does not pose a problem in our effort to\ntap “caseness” in depression.\n\nParticipants were classified as having major depression if they scored 22 or\ngreater on the IDD, equivalent to a score of 16 or higher on the BDI, and if they\nmet the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depression, including the 2-week\nsymptom duration. All participants retained their major depression classification\nboth during the preselection phase and later in the experiment, showing consistency\nover time. Participants were classified as nondepressed if they scored 11 or below\non the IDD at both assessment times. Given the similarity of the IDD and the\nBDI, the IDD classification of nondepressives in this study was comparable to that\nused in prior studies (e.g., Andersen et al, 1992), but “caseness’ in major depression\nmade the present depressed participants different from those in related prior stud-\nies. The study included 20 participants qualifying for a diagnosis of major depression\nand 17 nondepressives, with a mean IDD score of 35.6 in major depression (SD =\n9.7; range = 23-59), equivalent to a BDI score of 27 (excluding “caseness”), and\n4.5 in the nondepressed group (SD = 4.0; range = 0-11), equivalent to a BDI score\nof 3.5.\n\nIn the microcomputer-based experiment, participants were asked to make\njudgments about whether or not each of various positive or negative future events\nwas likely to happen to them or to the average student. In addition, both depressed\nand nondepressed participants were randomly assigned to a concurrent attentional\n\nDSM-III criteria specify that either dysphoric mood (defined as sad mood, irritability, or hopelessness)\nor anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities) must be present for a diagnosis of Major\nDepression. DSM-IV requires either dysphoric mood or anhedonia, but not hopelessness or irritability.\nThus, the scoring algorithm for the IDD was modified so that items indexing dysphoria, sad mood, or\nanhedonia were consistent with DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode (Goldston et al., 1990;\nZimmerman and Coryell, 1994).\n\n\nFuture-Event Schemas 317\n\nload condition or to a no-load condition within which they made these predictions\n(modeled after Andersen et al., 1992; Bargh & Tota, 1988). Afterward, all partici-\npants completed a questionnaire about rumination.\n\nInstrument for Assessing Depression\n\nThe IDD (Zimmerman & Coryell, 1987) is a self-report measure that assesses\nthe symptoms of major depression and their duration so as to identify cases of\nmajor depression according to DSM-IV. To meet criteria for Major Depressive\nDisorder, respondents must endorse at least five items from nine symptom clusters\nand must indicate having had all symptoms for at least 2 weeks. Endorsed items\nmust also have a clinical severity of at least 2 on a scale of 0-4 or at least 3 for\nloss of interest or loss of pleasure (see below).\n\nThe IDD contains 22 items, each covering one symptom using five relevant\nself-statements arranged in order of severity, modeled after the Beck Depression\nInventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961). Respondents\nare asked to pick the statement that best describes how they have felt over the\npast week. The IDD diagnoses Major Depressive Disorder according to DSM-\nIV. Although it was originally designed in accordance with DSM-III (American\nPsychiatric Association, 1980), a simple change in the scoring algorithm enables\nDSM-IV diagnosis. Each item yields a score ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 representing\nno disturbance, 1 representing subclinical severity, and 2 or above representing\nclinical severity. Scores are summed to yield a total ranging from 0 to 88. (Each\nitem on the BDI can range in severity from 0 to 3, and the measure yields a total\nscore ranging from 0 to 63; Beck et al., 1979.) Importantly, the duration of each\nsymptom is also measured, which is the main innovation that enables assessment\nof “caseness” in qualifying for a diagnosis of major depression. That is, respondents\nindicate whether or not the symptom has been present for more than 2 weeks. In\naddition, we employed the caution of including only participants who remained\nstable in their depression classification between the initial assessment and the end\nof the experiment (as suggested by Vredenburg et al., 1993; see also, e.g., Deardoff &\nFunabiki, 1985; Kendall, Hollon, Beck, Hammen, & Ingram, 1987; Kendall & In-\ngram, 1989; Tennen, Hall, & Affleck, 1995).\n\nThe IDD has excellent validity and reliability in mixed inpatient psychiatric\nsamples (Zimmerman et al., 1986) and in community samples (Zimmerman &\nCoryell, 1987, 1988). Studies comparing the IDD with structured clinical interviews\nin diagnosing major depression have found high rates of agreement (Zimmerman &\nCoryell, 1987, 1994). Comparing diagnoses derived from the IDD and from the\nDiagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, Helzer, Croughan, & Ratcliff, 1981)\nin a large community sample (n = 394), the overall rate of agreement was 97.2%\n\n“The highest score possible for an item on the BDI is 3, whereas for the IDD it is 4. On a separate\ntopic, we calculated the IDD cutoff score for nondepressed participants using the number of highest\npossible scores allowable while remaining in the category. In prior work (e.g., Andersen, 1990; Andersen\nct al., 1992), 8 was the cutoff for nondepression (three scores of 3, minus a score of 1). On the IDD,\nthis translates to a score of 11 (three scores of 4, minus a score of 1).\n\n\n318 Andersen and Limpert\n\n(Zimmerman & Coryell, 1987). For participants who completed the IDD within 1\nweek of the DIS (rn = 211), agreement increased to 98.1%, and the IDD showed\nhigh sensitivity in yielding true positives (80.0%, 4 of 5 cases) and high specificity\nin yielding true negatives (98.5%, 203 of 206 cases). Hence, the IDD is clearly a\nvalid measure of major depression.\n\nThe IDD has been used with increasing frequency in recent years (e.g.,\nFranche & Dobson, 1992; Goethe & Fischer, 1995; Hill & Knowles, 1991; McFarlane,\nBellissimo, & Norman, 1995; Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow, 1991; Prud'homme &\nBarron, 1992; Schlager, Froom, & Jaffe, 1995; Scott & O'Hara, 1993; Veiel, 1993;\nWilliamson & Yates, 1989). It has been shown to be a stable, internally consistent,\nvalid measure of depressive symptomatology among college students. Based on a\nlarge sample (n = 2,079) of undergraduates (Goldston, O'Hara, & Schartz, 1990),\nthe split-half reliability was .86 and Cronbach’s alpha was .84. A subset of 57 students\ncompleting the IDD a second time 48 hr later showed a test-retest reliability of\n.92. A subset of 265 students completing the IDD 14 weeks later showed a test-retest\nreliability of .56. Importantly, a subset of 30 students took part in a comparison of\nIDD diagnoses and diagnoses derived from the Schedule for Affective Disorders\nand Schizophrenia (SADS; Endicott & Spitzer, 1978) modified for DSM-III-R\n(American Psychiatric Association, 1987), showing overall agreement of 86.7%\n(kappa = .67), sensitivity of 70%, and specificity of 95.0%.\n\nIn addition, the prevalence rate of major depression using the IDD has been\nestimated to be 5.4% for men and 5.6% for women in this college population\n(Goldston et al., 1990), substantially lower than the 9-20% prevalence estimates\nof depression based on other self-report measures (Boyd & Weissman, 1981), and\ncomparable to epidemiologic data on the 6-month prevalence estimates for major\ndepression of 1.1-3.9% for men and 3.0-6.1% for women aged 18-24 years (Meyers\net al,, 1984). Thus, the IDD provides for a relatively accurate prevalence estimate\nof depression relative to other self-report inventories (Goldston et al., 1990; see\nalso Coyne, 1994). Indeed, in the present study, of 1,298 students assessed in mass\ntesting, 45 were classified as having major depression, yielding a prevalence rate\nof 3.47%, a rate comparable to that reported using interview measures. Moreover,\nof the 26 participants with major depression in the battery who agreed to participate\nin the experiment, only 17 remained depressed at the time of the experiment,\nsuggesting our dual assessment criteria excluded participants whose depression was\nmore fleeting.\n\nApparatus and Materials\n\nThirty-two positive and negative future events (see Table I) were used as\nexperimental stimuli, all rated by college students as moderately likely to be experi-\nenced by the average person (Andersen et al, 1992). Exceptionally likely and\nunlikely positive and negative events that would yield yes and no responses, respec-\ntively, with little variance were also included as fillers. All participants were exposed\nto the same set of future events, and equal numbers of positive and negative stimuli\nthat were moderately likely, highly likely, or highly unlikely were randomly paired,\n\n\nFuture-Event Schemas 319\n\nTable I Life Events That Participants Judged Would or Would Not Happen at Some\nTime in the Future by the Valence of the Event\n\nNegative events Positive events\nBe stuck in a unfulfilling job Cope successfully with job pressures\nRegret a major life decision Achieve life goals\nWork with unpleasant people Live a healthy and active life\nExperience the death of a spouse Live in an ideal home\nGet a fatal disease Do enjoyable things\nSuffer a great financial loss Have a sexually fulfilled life\nBe unhappy in a long-term relationship Have plenty of money\nHave a nervous breakdown Have an ideal job\nFail to contribute to society Be satisfied with major life decisions\nBe very lonely when old Gain the respect of my colleagues\nEventually become senile Fall in love\nCause someone to suffer Help another person\nBe divorced Receive an award\nBe hospitalized for an illness Travel around the world\nGet laid off Be self-employed\nBe betrayed by a friend Get a promotion\n\non an individualized basis for each participant, with the self or the average other.\nThe order of the stimuli to be judged was individually randomized for each partici-\npant. That is, the order of the target person judged (self vs. other), of event valence,\nand of specific items was completely randomized to ensure that participants would\nnot develop any target expectancies that might artificially reduce response times\n(Bargh & Tota, 1988). As indicated, participants pressed yes or no on a response\nbox for each future event while the computer automatically recorded both response\ncontent (yes or no) and latency (in milliseconds). In the attentional load condition,\na microphone was placed on the table, ostensibly to record participants as they\nrepeated aloud each random six-digit number, while the experimenter actually kept\ntrack of digit-response accuracy. Each future event was presented only once to\neach participant.\n\nProcedure\n\nExperimental Instructions\n\nParticipants took part individually, and were told that they would be asked\nwhether or not a given event was likely to happen to them or to the average NYU\nundergraduate at some time in the future and that they should respond yes or no\nas quickly as possible while also responding as accurately as possible. Indeed, to\nprevent a speed-accuracy tradeoff, we also informed participants that we were\nmore interested in the accuracy of each response than in its speed. Participants in\nthe attentional load condition were told that, before each trial, a random six-digit\nnumber would appear on the screen that they would be asked to hold in mind\nwhile making each judgment and to say aloud into the microphone after each trial.\nParticipants assigned to the no-load condition simply made each judgment without\nholding such a digit in mind.\n\n\n320 Andersen and Limpert\n\nEach trial began with the message “NEXT TRIAL FOLLOWS,” which ap-\npeared on the computer monitor for 1 sec. After a delay of 1 sec, a prompt appeared\ncentered near the top of the screen. In the attentional load condition, the prompt\nsaid “REMEMBER THESE DIGITS,” and after a 1-sec delay, a random six-digit\nnumber was presented and remained on the screen for 2 sec. The screen was then\ncleared, there was another 1-sec delay, and the regular presentation of the trial\noccurred (to be described below). Once the participant responded yes or no, there\nwas another 1-sec delay followed by the message “SAY THE 6-DIGIT NUMBER\nALOUD NOW.” The participant was then given 4 sec to repeat the six-digit number\nbefore the next trial.\n\nFor all participants, each judgment was preceded by one of two prompts, “IS\nTHIS LIKELY TO HAPPEN TO YOU?” or “IS THIS LIKELY TO HAPPEN\nTO THE AVERAGE NYU STUDENT?” After 1 sec, the future event to be\njudged appeared. Participants responded by pressing yes or no, which terminated\nthe display. After another 1 sec, the next trial began.\n\nThe experimenter was blind to participants’ depression status throughout\nthe experiment.\n\nAccuracy of Digit Recall\n\nTo ensure that depressed and nondepressed participants in the attentional load\ncondition did not differentially take their attention away from the digit task in\nmaking their judgments, the accuracy of participants’ memory for the six digits they\nheld in mind during each trial was examined. For each of the 64 trials, digit-recall\ninaccuracy ranged from 6 (all six digits recalled incorrectly) to 0 (no digit recalled\nincorrectly). Analysis of the average number of errors participants made across all\ntrials showed that there were no significant differences between nondepressed and\ndepressed participants. The mean number of errors was 1.17 for nondepressives\nand 0.93 for major depressives, F(1,15) < 1.\n\nSecond Diagnostic Assessment\n\nFollowing all trials, participants again filled out the IDD to verify their depres-\nsion group classification.\n\nRumination Questionnaire\n\nParticipants then completed a measure of future-event rumination, based on\na negative life event, created for the present research. The measure asked partici-\npants to report the most negative life event that had happened to them within the\nlast 2 weeks, a period corresponding to the time during which we assessed depression\n(the same 2-week period), and to rate the negativity of that event. As an index of\nfuture-event rumination, we asked participants to rate three items tapping how\nmuch the event had led them to ruminate about the future, how much it had led\nto intrusive thoughts about the future, and how intense their thoughts were. We\nalso assessed rumination about the self by asking participants to rate the same three\nquestions about rumination about the self, the extent to which the event had led\n\n\nFuture-Event Schemas 321\n\nthem to wonder and think about what kind of person they are, and the intrusiveness\nand intensity of the thoughts. These latter factors are important in ruminative\nprocesses (Tait and Silver, 1989). All items were rated on 8-point scales.\n\nTo verify the notion that our separate rumination questions, about future\nand self, meaningfully captured these respective constructs, we conducted a factor\nanalysis of these six items using varimax rotation. As predicted, two factors emerged,\nthe first including the three items related to the self, with factor loadings of .77 or\nhigher (a factor accounting for 43.7% of the variance), and the second including\nthe three items related to the future, with factor loadings of .68 or higher (a\nfactor accounting for 38.0% of the variance). Hence, future-event rumination and\nrumination about the self were examined as separate composite measures.\n\nEthical Issues\n\nBased on prior work in this area, we assumed that the effects of schema\nactivation among depressives in this study would be minimal and transient. Nonethe-\nless, a trained doctoral student in clinical psychology served as the experimenter\nin every session and was poised to detect and respond to any mood changes that\nmight be evident (none were). Moreover, a department-wide decision was made\nto exclude any student from the study who scored high on suicidality, while making\na referral to a clinical psychologist for evaluation and treatment. We followed this\nprocedure at both administration times. However, no student reported suicidality\nor showed increases in depression in the experiment to warrant such action. Finally,\nwe were instructed by our university human subjects committee not to discuss in\nour debriefing the preselection of participants for depression, so as not to trigger\nproblematic issues for participants. We complied with this request.\n\nRESULTS\n\nResponse Latencies\n\nBefore analyzing for automaticity, raw response latencies were trimmed so\nthat any data points that were three standard deviations above the overall mean\nwere treated as outliers, as is standard procedure in reaction-time analyses due to\nskew in these distributions (Ratcliff, 1993). This removed a small proportion of\ndata points greater than 7818 msec for each participant, an inordinate amount of\ntime to make this type of judgment, which would have otherwise introduced effort\nin our assessment of automaticity.\n\nParticipants’ average response latency to predict events of each valence for\nself or other was examined in a 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 (Depression X Load X Event\nValence X Self/ Other) analysis of variance (ANOVA) with two repeated measures.\nWe predicted greater relative automaticity (i.e., smaller increases in response latency\ndue to load) among depressed participants than among nondepressed participants.\nIf valence plays no role, the analysis should yield a two-way interaction between\ndepression and load, and if it is relevant, a three-way interaction should emerge\n\n\n322 Andersen and Limpert\n\ninvolving event valence, and our contrasts should show that the load/no-load differ-\nence is smaller among depressives than among nondepressives.\n\nThe omnibus analysis yielded a reliable main effect for load, F(1,33) = 7.67,\np = .01, as expected, indicating longer latencies under load (M = 2774 msec) than\nunder no load (M = 1902 msec). This shows that dual-task interference was in fact\nintroduced. This analysis also yielded a main effect for valence, F(1,33) = 37.15,\np <.0001, indicating that, on average, predictions about positive events were made\nmore quickly (M = 2073 msec) than were predictions about negative events (M =\n2534 msec).\n\nTurning to our main hypothesis, the two-way interaction between depression\nand load did not emerge, F(1,33) = 1.08, p = .31. The analysis did, however, yield\nthe same three-way interaction between depression, load, and event valence that\nemerged in prior work using this paradigm (Andersen et al., 1992), although it was\nmarginally significant, F(1,33) = 3.39, p = .08. Planned contrasts were conducted\nnonetheless to examine our specific predictions.” As predicted, and as portrayed in\nFig. 1, the load/no-load difference in response latency was relatively smaller among\nparticipants with major depression than among nondepressed participants. That\nis, for predictions about negative events, depressives showed smaller increases in\nresponse latency due to load (M = 445) than did nondepressives (M = 1381),\n(33) = 3.61, p < .001 (d = 1.19), and the same effect held for positive events\n(major depression, M = 645; no depression, M = 1017), (33) = 1.61, p < .06,\nalthough the latter was marginal (d = .53). (All reported contrasts are a priori and\nhence one-tailed.) This pattern of findings emerged with a medium to large effect\nsize, and because automaticity is typically conceptualized in relative terms (Bargh,\n1989, 1994), examining the degree to which automaticity is present in one group\nof participants relative to another for a given type of judgment makes sense. When\njudgments are made relatively automatically by a set of participants, the introduction\nof an attentional load condition should increase latencies relatively less than it does\nfor the same judgments made by other participants. Hence, our evidence for a\nlesser magnitude in the load/no-load difference among participants with major\ndepression relative to nondepressives is meaningful and suggests relatively more\nautomaticity in making future-event predictions in major depression.\n\nPessimism/Optimism in Yes—No Responses\n\nContent of Future-Event Representations\n\nIn conjunction with our main hypotheses concerning automaticity, it is impor-\ntant to examine the extent of self-reported pessimism in participants’ positive and\nnegative future-event predictions. To do this, we analyzed participants’ yes-no\nresponses to the various future events they judged, comparing the mean number\n\n\"In calculating these contrasts, we did not use the error term for the depression X load X event type\ninteraction in this mixed-mode design, as would be acceptable in a complete between-subjects factorial\ndesign. In a mixed-model design, this error term does not accurately estimate the error variance pertinent\nto the within-participant factor (i.e., furture-event valence). Therefore, we conducted separate analyses\nfor positive events and for negative event to obtain the proper error term for each such contrast.\n\n\nFuture-Event Schemas 323\n\n1600\n\n1400 _\n\n_\n\nAverage Load/No-Load Difference\nin Average Response Latency\ng\n\n800\n600\n400 I\nPositive Events Negative Events\nW Clinical Depressives.

The\nanalysis yielded a marginal main effect for depression, F(1,33) = 3.87, p = .058,\nqualified by the predicted interaction between depression and event valence,\nF(1,33) = 7.73, p < .01, as portrayed in Fig. 2. Planned contrasts indicated, in fact,\nthat participants with major depression said yes to fewer positive events (M = 5.39)\nthan did nondepressed participants (M = 7.09), #(33) = 2.16, p < .05 (d = .86),\nand unlike prior results (Andersen et al., 1992), no reliable difference between\ngroups in response to negative events (nondepressed, M = 3.85, depressed, M =\n4.34,t <1;d = 21). These data suggest a lack of optimism in the participants with\nmajor depression in this study rather than pessimism per se. That is, the content\nof future-event predictions in major depression appears to be defined by the anticipa-\ntion of fewer positive events than nondepressives anticipate.\n\nThe omnibus ANOVA also yielded other reliable findings. First, there was a\nmain effect for event valence, F(1,33) = 29.61, p < .0001, such that, on average,\nparticipants predicted more positive (M = 6.18) than negative events (M = 4.12),\nalthough this finding was qualified by the interaction. Second, it yielded a main\neffect for the self-other factor, F(1,33) = 13.62, p < .001, which itself was qualified\nby an interaction between this factor and event valence, F(1,33) = 21.79, p <.0001.\nThe latter indicated that participants predicted fewer negative events for themselves\n\n\n324 Andersen and Limpert\n\n75\n\nAverage Number of YES Responses\nom\nwn\n\n5!\n45\n4\n3s [____\nPositive Events Negative Events\nW Clinical Depressives 0 Nondepressives\n\nFig. 2.

These additional findings do not compromise\nour central comparisons concerning depressives versus nondepressives.\n\nRelevance of Yes—No Responses to the Interpretation of\nResponse-Latency Analyses\n\nThe analysis of participants’ yes—no responses showed no reliable interactions\nbetween load and other factors (Fs < 1) nor a main effect for load, which generally\nallows one to interpret response latency differences between the load and no-load\nconditions in terms of automaticity (see Andersen et al., 1992).\n\nRumination\n\nGiven our interest in ruminative thought processes, participants’ rating of each\nrumination item was examined in a 2 X 2 (Depression X Load) ANOVA. (No\ndifferences between major depressives and nondepressed participants were found\nin the perceived negativity of the life event reported for this rumination measure,\nwhich equates participants on this variable, F < 1.)\n\n\nFuture-Event Schemas 32\n\nb3\n\nRumination About the Future and the Self\n\nUsing a composite reflecting rumination about the future (with high interitem\n\nreliability across the three items, alpha = .90), the results showed that participants\n\n. Hence, in major\n\ndepression there was more rumination both about the future and about the self\nthan with nondepressed participants. In conjunction with our evidence showing\ngreater automaticity in the future-event predictions among major depressives rela-\ntive to nondepressives, these data provide evidence that rumination both about the\nfuture and about the self cooccurs with automaticity in future-event predictions.\n\nDoes Rumination About the Future Account for Future-Event\nAutomaticity in Depression?\n\nAutomatic future-event predictions among major depressives should be non-\nstrategic, and self-reported rumination should thus not account for such effects. To\nexplore whether or not self-reported rumination might account for the effects, we\nconducted the response-latency analysis again controlling for rumination about the\nfuture. Hence, the comparable analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted\nusing a future-event-rumination composite as a covariate. This ANCOVA yielded\n\nessentially the same results. That is, it showed the main effects for load, F(1.32) =\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur central hypothesis in this research was confirmed, in that participants\nwith major depression showed relatively greater automaticity in their future-event\npredictions than did nondepressives. Specifically, these depressed participants\nshowed smaller increases in response latency under attentional load (relative to\nno-load) for both positive and negative events than did nondepressives. Indeed,\ntheir future-event predictions were also less optimistic than were those of nonde-\npressives, in that these individuals were less likely to predict that positive events\nwould occur, although equally likely to predict that negative events would not,\nsuggesting no explicit pessimism in this sample. Moreover, and again as predicted,\nparticipants with major depression showed more rumination about the future than\ndid nondepressives. Overall, the findings conceptually replicate evidence about\nautomaticity in future-event predictions found among moderate depressives\n\n\n326 Andersen and Limpert\n\n(Andersen et al., 1992) and extend it to major depression, while linking it with\nfuture-event rumination.\n\nThe data suggest future-event schemas among people with major depression\nthat enable relatively effortless future-event predictions. By contrast, nondepressives\nappear not to possess a well-developed knowledge structure concerning future\noutcomes, suggesting that such schemas are unique to depression. The data thus\nindicate that this element of Beck’s (1967) negative cognitive triad is also repre-\nsented schematically in memory. These findings also contribute to research on\nautomatic thoughts in major depression, by measuring automaticity in future-events\npredictions. Although automatic thoughts are considered crucial in depression, their\nautomatic nature has tended not to be examined (Segal, 1988; although see, e.g.,\nAndersen et al., 1992; Bargh & Tota, 1988; Hartlage et al., 1993; Segal et al., 1998).\nOur design assessed relatively effortless processing using a dual-task attentional\nload paradigm that allowed us largely to rule out the role of strategic, effortful\ncognitive processing in future-event predictions.\n\nTo establish the connection between future-event automaticity and ongoing\nruminative processes, we examined rumination about the future, and predicted that\nparticipants with major depression would report more future-event rumination than\nwould nondepressives. This prediction was confirmed, suggesting that rumination\nabout the future on the basis of recent negative life events cooccurs with relative\nautomaticity in future-event predictions among major depressives, extending the\nliteratures on automaticity, schematicity, and rumination in depression.\n\nBroadly speaking, our results for major depression are consistent with those\nobtained for moderate depressives (Andersen et al., 1992), but some discrepancies\nare worth noting. In the current study, we obtained significant latency differences\nbetween the load and no-load conditions for both positive and negative events not\nonly among nondepressed participants, but even among depressives. By contrast,\nthese differences did not reach significance among moderate depressives in the prior\nwork (Andersen et al., 1992), and the prior work thus offered a more “absolute”\ndemonstration of automaticity among moderate depressives than did the present\nstudy among individuals with major depression.\n\nThe notion that automaticity in the future-event predictions of major de-\npressives, or in their future-event schemas, might be less robust than that among\nmoderate depressives is counterintuitive. Less schematicity in the future-event rep-\nresentations of major depressives relative to moderate depressives would seem to\nbe the opposite of what should be expected if increased severity is associated with\nfuture-event schematicity. Automaticity in future-event predictions, however, may\nnot emerge quite so linearly as being a simple function of severity. Rather, automa-\nticity may represent a kind of set point that is reached in the course of depression,\na set point occurring even among those who are moderately depressed, implying\nthat it exists in major depression as well, but does not begin there. Indeed, its\nassessment in major depression may be interfered with by other factors. Qualitative\ndifferences among moderate and more serious depression, such as psychomotor\nretardation or lowered motivation, may alter manifestations of automaticity in the\nlatter group. That is, the constellation of symptoms associated with major depression\nmay lead to difficulties in focusing on the task at hand (Hertel & Hardin, 1990).\n\n\nFuture-Event Schemas 327\n\nThe major depressives in the present study indeed showed longer raw latencies\nthan the moderate depressives in prior work (Andersen et al., 1992). Indeed, serious\ndepression may itself place a considerable demand on cognitive processes (Hartlage\net al, 1993).\n\nThe present study of course differed from prior work on future-event schemas\n(Andersen et al., 1992) in the methods used to classify participants into depression\ngroups. Whereas prior work used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck et\nal., 1961), we used the Inventory to Diagnose Depression (IDD; Zimmerman et\nal., 1986) and included only participants qualifying for major depression, that is,\nthose reporting a relevant constellation of symptoms for at least 2 weeks, both\nbefore the experiment and afterward. Hence, the present study examined “caseness”\nclassification—major depression or not—in a manner stable across two administra-\ntion times separated by anywhere from 2 to 22 weeks. This means that the de-\npressives in this study were more severely impaired than prior participants in the\ncomparable design (Andersen et al., 1992). Nonetheless, the data demonstrate\nrelatively greater automaticity among these major depressives than among controls.\nAlthough we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that future-event schemas\nare less operative in major depression than in moderate depression, indications in\nthe literature would suggest that other factors are likely to have interfered with its\neffective assessment among participants with major depression.\n\nOn a different note, prior work (Andersen et al., 1992) found more pessimism\nin moderate depressives than in nondepressives in two ways, both in predicting\nfewer positive events and in predicting more negative events. The present study\nshowed that people with major depression predicted only fewer positive events and\nnot more negative events, a pattern of findings that was unpredicted and hence any\naccount of it must remain speculative. This finding is provocative, however, because\nthe valence of anticipated outcomes is central to theoretical frameworks relevant\nto depression, such as self-discrepancy theory (Higgins, 1987). In that theory, the\nabsence of positive outcomes is of special relevance to depression because positive\noutcomes and their withdrawal are crucial to ideal-self/actual-self discrepancies and\nsuch discrepancies are associated with depression (see Higgins, 1987). Although\nour model argues that depression is associated with pessimism and future-event\nautomaticity, it is silent on different patterns based on the positivity or negativity\nof the anticipated event. Self-discrepancy theory, by contrast, provides reason to\nbelieve that this effect may be meaningful, and the data may thus contribute to the\nself-discrepancy literature as well.\n\nSimilarly, the present results are also broadly consistent with cognitive—\nmediational theories of emotion (e.g., Beck, 1974; Lazarus & Averill, 1972), which\nconceptualize depressive affect as resulting from the appraisal of loss of a valued\noutcome. These models again support the idea that the loss of positive outcomes\nmay be central in the anticipation of future events in depression (see also Brown &\nHarris, 1978; Oatley & Bolton, 1985). The fact that no such pattern emerged for\nmoderate depressives in prior work, but did among major depressives in the present\nwork, suggests that major depression may be more likely to involve loss and a lack\nof all hope.\n\nAs indicated, individuals with major depression in this study experienced more\n\n\n328 Andersen and Limpert\n\nruminative thoughts related to the future, based on their own bad experiences, than\ndid nondepressives, an effect that cooccurred with evidence about future-event\nschemas in major depression. This finding lends support to our overall framework\nwhich suggests that depression can be viewed in terms of a time course beginning\nwith strategic, effortful rumination about the future based on negative events and\nmild depression, then continued elaboration and rehearsal, and finally depression,\nas the process of making future-event predictions becomes relatively routinized.\nThe practice effects associated with strategic rumination should lead to the onset\nof automaticity, so that rumination is no longer deliberate, but rather is experienced\nas involuntary (Andersen et al, 1992; see also Andersen, 1990; Andersen &\nSchwartz, 1992). A clear demonstration of this precise pattern would require a\nlongitudinal design in which depression, rumination, and automaticity in future-\nevent predictions are assessed over time, with strategic rumination at one point in\ntime accounting for automaticity in future-event predictions at a later point in\ntime, all as part of increasing severity in depression. The present research was not\nlongitudinal and it did not yield an index of automaticity calculated for each subject\nthat could be examined in direct relation to our (between-participant) index of\nrumination, which compared load and no-load participants. Although this precluded\nany test of the potential mediating role of rumination (as a kind of practice) in the\nformation of future-event schemas, the data nonetheless provide support for the\nhypothesis that both future-event schemas and future-event rumination are opera-\ntive in major depression.\n\nIt is also worth noting that depressives in the current study showed greater\nrumination than did nondepressives not only about the future, but also about the\nself. A recent negative life event led them to experience more ruminative thoughts\nabout the self than did nondepressives, just as they did about the future. This is\nconsistent with work suggesting that ruminative thoughts following a negative life\nevent deal with self-evaluation (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991; Tait & Silver, 1989). Both\nrumination about the self and about the future were reported more by depressives\nthan by nondepressives in this study, and hence each may well be associated with\nschemas—self-schemas and future-event schemas, respectively—based on simple\npractice effects (Smith, 1989, 1994), a matter that warrants future research attention.\n\nAlthough these findings are provocative and do appear to suggest that both\nfuture-event schemas and rumination about the future occur among individuals\nwith major depression, we acknowledge that the present research had limitations\nthat suggest caution is warranted. First, our measure of rumination involved retro-\nspect reports of ruminations based on a recent life event, and thus did not tap\nconcurrent, ongoing rumination in the experiment. Although the rumination find-\nings concerning future events in this research are nicely consistent with our overall\nhypothesis, the measure we employed did not allow us to assess directly the kind\nof ongoing rumination that should accompany depression, which could have enabled\na better test of our model.\n\nA second limitation is the very small sample size employed in this research,\nwhich is far less than ideal. Of course, our sample size was small precisely because\nof the stringent criteria we used for identifying individuals with major depression.\nAll participants identified as having major depression qualified for this diagnosis\n\n\n\nFuture-Event Schemas 329\n\nboth in a mass testing session 3-11 weeks before the experiment and during the\nexperiment itself. This consistency/duration requirement enabled us to rule out\ntransient fluctuations in dysphoria of less than 1 month (since all major depression\nby definition has lasted for at least 2 weeks). This criterion led us to classify a small\nnumber of potential participants as qualifying for the study as major depressives,\nseverely restricting our sample size. This obviously limited statistical power in this\nresearch and reduced our ability to detect differences, while also being compromis-\ning in other ways, suggesting that follow-up research would be useful. The main\nconcern about low statistical power, however, is that it makes it less possible to\ndetect effects that do exist, not more possible to spuriously confirm a priori hypothe-\nses. Hence, obtaining evidence for predicted effects with low power is worthy of\nnote, even though caution is warranted.\n\nA third limitation is that we used a paper-and-pencil self-report measure to\ndetermine the presence or absence of major depression, which arguably provides\na less precise measure of “caseness” in major depression than use of a standard\nstructured-interview measure would have because careful follow-up questions make\nsuch interviews the current “gold standard” in psychiatric diagnosis. On the other\nhand, the consistency between the measure we employed and standard interview\nprocedures for diagnosing major depression has been shown to be very high, as we\nhave described (see Method). Hence, although the measure we used is clearly\nimperfect, it has very high validity in diagnosing major depression.\n\nFinally, there is the limiting condition in this research that we examined only\nuniversity students (in an ethnically diverse urban setting). Because of our exacting\ncriteria for qualifying for a diagnosis of major depression, many of the problems\nof studies among college students are to an extent overcome, of course, and the\nuse of “caseness” in major depression extends prior work among college students,\nwho differ from a random sample, at minimum, by being largely in late adolescence/\nearly adulthood and qualified, motivated, and financially able to attend a university.\n\nIn sum, given numerous criticisms of research on studies of subclinical depres-\nsion, our examination of future-event schemas among people with major depression\nin the current study (even if from a college-student population) represents an\nimportant advance over prior work on future-event schemas (Andersen et al., 1992).\nMoreover, in demonstrating the relatively automatic nature of thoughts about the\nfuture in people with major depression along with rumination about the future, we\nhave forged a link with the literature on rumination as well. The data thus extend\nthe literature on automatic thoughts in major depression both into the domain of\nfuture events and into the realm of the experimental demonstration of automatic\ncognitive processes. Automatic thoughts are a prime target of change in cognitive\ntherapy for depression, and the relatively rigid nature of depressives’ thoughts\nabout the future may thus be relevant for treatment. In addition, although we\nregard the emergence of future-event schemas as a proximal influence on depression\nand assume that they may decay or become chronically deactivated by inhibitory\nprocesses when depression remits, we also speculate that future-event schemas\nmight instead become latent among remitted depressives and may thus serve as a\nvulnerability factor in relapse if effectively triggered by life circumstances, matters\nworthy of research attention.\n\n\n330 Andersen and Limpert\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe research was funded in part by a grant from the National Institute of\nMental Health (R01-MH48789).
