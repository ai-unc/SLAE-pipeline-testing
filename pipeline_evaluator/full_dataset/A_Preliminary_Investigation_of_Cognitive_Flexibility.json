M. Deveney\nHarvard University\n\nP. J. Deldin\nUniversity of Michigan-Ann Arbor\n\nClinical research suggests that individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) are cognitively\ninflexible, exhibiting ruminative, rigid, and automatic thoughts within a negative schema. However,\nexisting neuropsychological research on cognitive flexibility in this population has not employed\n\u2018emotional stimuli. Because research suggests that the performance of individuals with MDD is modulated\nwhen emotional stimuli are used, this study investigates the impact of emotional stimuli on cognitive\nflexibility performance through a novel emotional modification of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.\nControls were less flexible when stimuli were positive and individuals with MDD were less flexible when\nstimuli were negative relative to the controls. These divergent styles of responding to emotional\ninformation may contribute to the relative risk or protection from depressed mood.\n\nKeywords: emotion, depression, cognitive flexibility, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test\n\nClinical observations support the existence of restricted and\ninflexible cognitive processes in individuals with major depressive\ndisorder (MDD). For example, Beck's cognitive theory of depres-\nsion suggests that individuals with depression are stuck in a\n\u201cnegative loop.\u201d rigidly viewing themselves, the world, and the\nfuture in accordance with a negative cognitive schema (Beck,\n1967). Suicidal individuals, who often suffer from MDD, demon-\nstrate inflexible styles of thinking by generating fewer possible\nsolutions to problems (Schotte & Clum, 1987) and in viewing\ndeath as \u201cthe only solution possible to an unendurable level of\nmental pain\u201d (Jamison, 1999, p. 5).\n\nCognitive inflexibility may be related to neurological abnormal-\nities in populations with depression. The prefrontal cortex, thought\nto be important for performing executive functioning tasks includ-\ning cognitive flexibility tasks (Channon, 1996; Damasio & Ander-\nson, 2003), has been repeatedly noted to be hypoactive in individ-\nuals with MDD (Baxter et al., 1989; Davidson, 1994; Mayberg et\nal., 1999). Consequently, impaired cognitive flexibility in this\npopulation may stem from hypoactivation of brain regions thought\nto subserve cognitive flexibility abilities.\n\nFinally, research using neuropsychological tasks assessing cog-\nnitive flexibility indicates that depressed populations may have\n\nC.

One of the most\ncommonly used tests to assess an individuals ability to shift sets\nis the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST). In this task, individ-\nuals must learn a rule to perform the task correctly and later be able\nto adjust their performance when the rule unexpectedly changes.\nCognitively flexible individuals easily alter their response pattern\naccording to feedback, generating and testing new rules. Cogni-\ntively inflexible individuals persist in performing the task accord-\ning to the old rule, despite receiving feedback that their response\nis no longer correct (Channon, 1996; Damasio & Anderson, 2003).\nFor example, during the WCST individuals are asked to match a\n\u201ctarget\u201d card with various shapes to one of several \u201ccategory\u201d\ncards according to 3 rules: color, number, and type of shape on the\ncards. These rules switch without warning after a certain number\nof correct matches have been completed.\n\nDysphoric undergraduates (Channon, 1996) and individuals\nwith MDD have exhibited impairments on the WCST, suggesting\ndecreased cognitive flexibility (Austin, Ross, O\u2019Carrol, Ebmeier,\n& Goodwin, 1992; Grant, Thase & Sweeney, 2001; Kindermann,\nKalayam, Brown, Burdick, & Alexopoulos, 2000; Merriam, Thase,\nHaas, Keshavan, & Sweeney, 1999). However, impairments on\nthis task are not universally found (Fossati, Amar, Raouz, Ergis, &\nAllilaire, 1999; Martin, Oren, & Boone, 1991). In addition, under-\ngraduates who ruminate demonstrated decreased WCST perfor-\nmance as compared to those who do not ruminate (Davis &\nNolen-Hocksema, 2000).\n\nTaken together, these literatures suggest that individuals with\ndepression are characterized by constricted styles of thinking.\nBecause ruminative, rigid, and automatic negative thoughts within\na negative schema have been tied with the etiology, maintenance,\nand exacerbation of depressed mood states, a better understanding\nof cognitive flexibility and what subcomponent processes may be\nparticularly aberrant may be important for improving the treatment\nand prevention of MDD (Nolen-Hocksema, 1991, 2000; Young,\nWeinberger, & Beck, 2001).\n\n\nEs\n[5\n\n430 DEVENEY AND DELDIN\n\nEmotional Nature of Stimuli Affects Performance on\nCognitive Tasks\n\nOne area of interest is how cognitive flexibility processes affect\nsome of the maladaptive cognitions and emotional processing that\nare theorized to characterize depression (Beck, 1967). Does an\ninability to think flexibly play a role in how individuals with MDD\nprocess emotional information? Might decreased flexibility in the\npresence of negative stimuli play a role in the negative ruminative\nthoughts observed in clinical and experimental studies of MDD? A\nrobust empirical literature indicates that the emotional nature of\nstimuli can influence task performance. Research on numerous\ncognitive tasks has highlighted the existence of preferential pro-\ncessing of positive information by non-psychiatric controls as\ncompared to negative information (c.g. Matt, Vasquez, & Camp-\nbell, 1992; Taylor & Brown, 1988, 1994). Dysphoric individuals\nexhibit a similar mood congruency effect, exhibiting preferential\nrecall, identification, and delayed color naming of negative stimuli\n(for a review sce Williams, Watts, MacLeod, & Matthews, 1997).\nIndeed, this unique processing of negative information is a core\ncomponent of many information-processing models of depression\n(Bower, 1981; Ingram, 1984), perhaps involving an enhanced\nprocessing of negative information (Williams et al., 1997).\n\nTheoretically, it is likely that cognitive flexibility would be\nanother cognitive process that is influenced by the emotional\nnature of the stimuli. If individuals are likely to preferentially\nprocess or elaborate on mood congruent information as is sug-\ngested by the clinical and research literatures (Beck, 1967; Wil-\nliams et al., 1997), this may result in a decrease in resources\navailable in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, given its importance\nin cognitive flexibility tasks (Channon, 1996; Damasio & Ander-\nson, 2003). Similarly, some research suggests that the processing\nof negative stimuli by dysphoric individuals results in decreased\nprocessing of and attending to the non-emotional aspects of these\nstimuli (Siegle, Ingram, & Matt, 2002), consequently poor perfor-\nmance on cognitive flexibility tasks relates to a failure to attend to\naspects of the stimuli that are essential to good task performance.\nAlternatively, mood congruent information may be processed\nmore quickly and efficiently due to congruency with an activated\ncognitive schema (Bower, 1981), and the resulting decrease in task\nload may lead to increased flexibility for mood congruent\ninformation.\n\nTo date, research on cognitive flexibility has only examined the\nimpact of induced positive mood upon flexibility for non-\nemotional stimuli in a healthy population and has not used stan-\ndard neuropsychological tests of cognitive flexibility (Ashby, Isen,\n& Turken, 1999). This line of rescarch suggests that the induction\nof a positive mood state can increase creative problem solving\nskills and spontaneous cognitive flexibility among non-psychiatric\ncontrols (Ashby et al., 1999; Isen, Daubman, & Nowicki, 1987;\nIsen, Johnson, Mertz, & Robinson, 1985; for alternate findings see\nPhillips, Bull, Adams, & Fraser, 2002).\n\nResearch using neuropsychological tests of cognitive flexibility\nin individuals with depression have used non-emotional stimuli\nand consequently cannot inform us about whether cognitive flex-\nibility is influenced by the emotional stimuli used in the task. A\nfirst step towards understanding the influence of emotion on cog-\nnitive flexibility processes is to investigate whether performance\n\non cognitive flexibility processes, measured by standard neuropsy-\nchological tests, differs depending on the emotional valence of the\nstimuli employed and the clinical status of the study participants.\n\nCurrent Study\n\nTaken together, the previous literature suggests that the emo-\ntional nature of many cognitive tasks affects the performance of\nindividuals with MDD and non-psychiatric controls (for a review\nsee Williams et al., 1997). It remains unclear whether emotional\nstimuli will influence performance on cognitive flexibility tasks in\nnon-depressed and MDD populations and, to the best of our\nknowledge, no versions of the WCST have evaluated whether the\nemotional nature of stimuli affects the ability of individuals to shift\nbetween perceptual properties of the stimuli.\n\nIn the current study, the impact that emotional stimuli have on\ncognitive flexibility in individuals with MDD and non-psychiatric\ncontrols was assessed. Specifically, this preliminary study addressed\nwhether individuals with MDD exhibit poorer performance on a\ncognitive flexibility task when stimuli are negatively valenced. In\naddition, it addressed whether varying the emotional nature of the\nstimuli would impact the performance of controls on the task. To this\nend, participants completed a computerized WCST as well as a\nmodification of this task to include emotional stimuli (ECST). The\nfollowing hypotheses were made: (1) individuals with MDD will\nexhibit decreased flexibility for the negatively valenced words in the\nECST compared to the positively valenced words; (2) the controls\nwill exhibit no decrease in flexibility on any valenced block of the\nECST. No explicit hypotheses were made regarding the WCST be-\ncause of the inconsistent results in the literature.\n\nMethod\nParticipants\n\nNewspaper advertisements and flyers posted in the Boston area were\nused to recruit participants for a series of studies investigating \u201cdepression\u201d\nor \u201cthoughts and emotions.\u201d Individuals were screened using the Structured\nClinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (4th edition) (DSM-IV), Patient Edition (SCID-UP), administered\nby a doctoral level clinician (PID) or graduate students in clinical psychol-\nogy trained in SCID administration (First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams,\n1995). Individuals were excluded from the study if they reported or were\ndiagnosed during the SCID interview with cognitive impairments (ic.,\nleaning disabilities), head injuries resulting in loss of consciousness for\nmore than ten minutes, bipolar disorder, psychosis, current substance\nabuse, current or past substance dependence, or seizure disorders.\nEighteen individuals (11 women), ages 21 to 63 ( = 33.8, SD = 12.6)\nwith a mean education level of 16.3 years (SD = 1.1) and with no current\nor past Axis I psychiatric diagnosis, comprised the control group. Nineteen\nindividuals (14 women), ages 21 to 58 years (M = 322, SD = 10.2) with\na mean education level of 15.7 years (SD = 14) who met DSM-IV criteria\nfor a current major depressive episode (MDE), comprised the MDD group.\nTwo individuals were experiencing a current MDE superimposed on dys-\nthymic disorder at the time of testing and 12 met criteria for at least one\ncurrent anxiety disorder (8 social phobia, 4 generalized anxiety disorder, 1\nspecific phobia, 1 post traumatic stress disorder, 1 panic disorder, 1\nagoraphobia without panic disorder, and 1 anxiety disorder not otherwise\nspecified). Other comorbidities included body dysmorphic disorder (1) and\nsomatoform disorder (1). Eleven individuals had experienced at least one\nadditional MDE in the past. Seventeen individuals had received treatment\nfor depression in the past and 10 were currently in treatment and taking\n\n\nEl\n[5\n\nFLEXIBILITY FOR EMOTIONAL INFORMATION 431\n\nantidepressant medications. Groups did not differ significantly for age,\neducation level, or number of men and women as determined by univariate\nanalyses of variance (ANOVA) and chi square analyses. See Table 1.\nExploratory analyses confirmed that there were no behavioral perfor-\nmance differences on the WCST and ECST between those individuals\ndiagnosed with MDD who were taking medications and those who were\nnot, between those currently receiving treatment and those who were not,\nand between those with recurrent MDD and those experiencing their first\nMDE. Consequently, the MDD group was not separated into separate\nsubgroups based on medication, treatment, or first episode status.\nParticipants were also administered the vocabulary subtest of the Wechs-\nler Adult Intelligence Scale (3rd edition) as a proxy for general intellectual\nability. There were no group differences on this measure, suggesting that\nperformance on the card sorting tasks is not likely to be attributable to\nintellectual differences between the groups, #(1, 35) = 0.31, p = 58.\n\nMaterials\n\nParticipants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck,\n\u2018Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961), Beck Hopelessness Scale\n(Beck & Weissman, 1974), and Spiclberger Anxiety Inventory-State and\nTrait Scales (STAIS/T; Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970) as indices\nof current depression severity, hopelessness, and present or trait anxiety\nlevels, respectively. Participants also completed the Ruminative Responses\nScale (RRS), Short Form, which assesses the degree to which individuals\nengage in ruminative behavior in response to depressed mood (Nolen-\nHocksema & Morrow, 1991; Treynor, Gonzalez, & Nolen-Hoeksema,\n2003). Groups differed predictably on self-report scales of depression,\nanxiety, and rumination as tested by separate univariate ANOVAS.\n\nStimuli\n\nAll stimuli were created using Microsoft Paint. Each WCST trial consisted\nof the presentation of one \u201ctrial card\u201d at the bottom of the screen and four \u201ckey\ncards\u201d at the top of the screen (see Figure 1). The four key cards consisted of\none red triangle, two green circles, three blue stars, and four yellow crosses,\nrespectively. The 128 trial cards consisted of all 64 combinations of color (red,\ngreen, yellow, or blue); shape (triangle, circle, star, or cross), and number (1,\n2,3, or 4 shapes) presented twice. The order of the trial cards was randomized\n\nTable 1\nDemographic Characteristics of the Sample\n\na b\n@ |x [|on item 1\nA *| gg [vem | Gm | dem |\n\u00ae [x om\nfestive.\n*\nfestive\n* festive.\n\u00a9 i Tem d it Tem\nitem te item\nvw Em we ew\nitem yo item | yor\ncabinet agony\ncabinet\ncabinet se\ncabinet agony\n\nFigure 1. Stimuli examples: a) Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, b) Emotional\nCard Sorting Task (ECST)-postive, c) ECST-neutral, d) ECST-negative\n\nand then presented in a fixed sequence so that all individuals saw the same\norder of stimuli.\n\n\u2018We designed the ECST to be as similar as possible to the WCST and,\ntherefore, although stimuli were emotional in nature, emotional valence\nwas irrelevant to successful performance on the task (see Figure 1). The\nkey cards in the ECST consisted of the word \u201citem\u201d appearing in the\nfollowing formats: printed once in red ink and Bauhaus 93 font, twice in\ngreen ink and Curlz MT font, three times in blue ink and italicized\nMercurius Script MT Bold font, and four times in brown ink and Times\nNew Roman font. The color brown was chosen for the fourth color\ncategory (rather than yellow as in the WCST) to make it easier to read the\nwords in the various fonts.\n\n\u2018The words that appeared on the ECST trial cards were drawn from the\nAffective Norms of English Words (ANEW; Bradley & Lang, 1999) set,\nwhich includes separate ratings on a 9-point Likert scale for valence and\narousal (low scores indicate low arousal or negative valence; see Appendix).\nTwo hundred and sixty-four words were classified into three categories:\n\nMean Standard deviation\nCharacteristic Controls MDD* Controls MDD F \u00bb\nN 18 19\nAge (years) 3383 32.18 126 10.18 0.19 0.66\nSex (F) 7(11) 5(14) 067\u00b0 041\nEducation (years) 1625 1574 11 14 149 023\nBDI 267 26.63 25 67 20186 <0001\nBHS 3.00 1331 26 40 82.74 <0.001\nSTALS 3233 57.68 96 119 49.50 <0.001\nSTALT 3147 64.89 88 66 16821 <0.001\nRRS 41.00 62.84 10.1 89 4768 <0001\nReflect 1153 11.89 34 25 0.14 72\nBrood 741 11.10 24 16 3062 <0001\nDepression 2059 3547 58 111 2499 <0.001\n\nNote.

Mean valence ratings differed\nsignificantly between cach of the three valence categories, Valence, F(2,\n261) = 2829.504, p < 001, m* = 0.97. Arousal ratings also differed between\nthe categories, Arousal, F(2, 261) = 100.246, p < 001, 2 = 043. Positive\nand negative stimuli were both significantly more arousing than neutral;\nhowever, positive and negative stimuli had equal arousal ratings. Participants\nwere asked to rate the emotional stimuli according to the self-assessment\nmanikin ratings scale used in the initial ANEW ratings (Bradley & Lang,\n1999) at the end of the testing session. Participants in both groups rated the\nstimuli similarly to each other and the initial ANEW index group.\n\n\u2018Words were matched for length and frequency of use (Kiicera & Francis,\n1967). Words were presented in three blocks of 88 words: positive, neutral,\nand negative. Each word was presented once as a trial card. Trial cards\nconsisted of words printed in a combination of the following three factors:\ncolors (red, green, blue, and brown), fonts (Bauhaus 93, Curlz MT, itali-\ncized Mercurius Script MT Bold, and Times New Roman) and number of\nwords on the card (1,2, 3, and 4). Each word was randomly assigned to a\nfont, color, and number of words. Word order was randomized and then\npresented to participants in a fixed order.\n\nProcedure\n\nConsistent with Harvard Institutional Review Board approval, the details\nof the study were explained to all participants and written consent was\nobtained. Study participation lasted between three and four hours over the\ncourse of two days. After completing the SCID in the first session,\nparticipants returned to the lab to complete the WCST, ECST, vocabulary\ntest, and questionnaires. Participants were compensated $10 for each hour\nof their time.\n\nCard Sorting Tasks\n\nAll tasks were performed on a Mac computer using the Psyscope\nprogram (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, & Provost, 1993). In both the WCST\nand ECST, participants were instructed to match each trial card to one of\nthe four key cards as best as they could. They were told that they would\nreceive feedback as to whether they were correct or incorrect after each\nmatch and should use that information to decide how to correctly match\nsubsequent cards. Consistent with standard WCST administration, partic-\nipants were not told what the rules might be, nor that the rules would\nchange in cither task. The rules that governed task feedback were color,\nshape, and number of shapes in the WCST, and color, font, and number of\nwords in the ECST. In both the WCST and ECST, once a participant made\n10 consecutive correct matches according to the operating rule, the com-\nputer changed the rule. At that point, the participant heard a beep signifying\nthat an error had been made and the word \u201cincorrect\u201d appeared at the\nbottom of the screen when s/he attempted to continue matching under the\nold rule. The participant needed to discover the new rule and match cards\ncorrectly according to the new rule to hear a beep signifying that a correct\nresponse had been given and to see the word \u201ccorrect\u201d printed at the bottom\nof the screen. The task was terminated when individuals correctly sorted to\nsix different rules (each of the three rules repeated) or until all of the cards\nin the set were used. Rule order was counterbalanced in the WCST and\nECST. Each rule occurred in each position (Ist, 2nd, or 3rd) an equal\nnumber of times. In the ECST, each rule occurred an equal number of times\nin each valence block and an equal number of times in each position (1st,\n2nd, or 3rd). The ECST was structured so that, for cach participant, a\ndifferent rule was in operation at the beginning of each block. In order to\nbe consistent with the standard administration of the WCST and to provide\n\nan accurate test of standard cognitive flexibility ability, all participants\ncompleted the WCST task first to ensure that individuals did not know\nabout rule changes before completing this task. Participants then completed\nthe three blocks of the ECST: one positive, one neutral, and one negative\nblock. Block order was counterbalanced across participants with each\nvalence block occurring Ist, 2nd, or 3rd an equal number of times.\n\nData Reduction and Analysis\n\nUnivariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to assess group\ndifferences for five variables commonly assessed in the WCST: (1) number\nof perseverative errors (the number of times the subject continues to sort\naccording to an old rule after the rule has changed: higher numbers indicate\ndecreased cognitive flexibility); (2) number of categories correctly sorted\n(maximum of six before the task terminated; higher numbers indicate\nincreased task performance); (3) number of cards used in the test (the\nnumber of cards to complete six categories and successful rule changes, or\nthe number of total cards viewed prior to test termination; higher numbers\nindicate decreased task performance); (4) number of non-perseverative\nerrors (the number of times a subject sorted according to a new rule or\nwhen a sort occurred for a trial card that matched more than one category;\nhigher numbers indicate decreased task performance, but not necessarily\nperseveration or decreased cognitive flexibility); and (5) the total number\nof errors (sum of perseverative and non-perseverative errors; higher num-\nbers indicate decreased task performance, including measures of decreased\ncognitive flexibility as well as poor performance more generally). We were\nparticularly interested in group differences for perseverative errors, the\npurest index of cognitive inflexibility; and we analyzed non-perseverative\nerrors as well to evaluate whether our findings were specific to inflexibil-\nity, rather than to overall poorer task performance reflecting general\ncognitive deficits, including decreased task engagement that are not rele-\nvant to the hypotheses in this project. If participants made more non-\nperseverative errors during mood congruent blocks, then we would have\nstrong support that participants were less engaged with the task during the\nmood congruent blocks, potentially reflecting distraction or rumination on\nthe emotional content of the words. This, in tur, would suggest that any\nrelative inflexibility during mood congruent blocks for the two participant\ngroups was due to decreased task engagement rather than decreased cog-\nnitive flexibility.\n\nECST data were analyzed using 3 X 2 repeated measures ANOVAS with\nstimulus Valence (positive, neutral, negative) as the within-subjects factor and\nGroup (control, MDD) as the between-subjects factor. Because our hypotheses\nwere specific for cognitive flexibility, which is best tapped by the number of\nperseverative errors made during the task, analyses were computed for the\nnumber of perseverative errors committed during each ECST block. Higher\nnumbers of perseverative errors in the negative ECST block among individuals\nwith MDD would indicate decreased cognitive flexibility in the presence of\nnegative stimuli. In order to test the specificity of these findings to persevera-\ntive errors and rule out the possibility that distraction or level of task engage-\n\u2018ment accounted for our findings, we conducted the same analysis for non-\nperseverative errors. The Huyndt-Feldt correction was employed to correct for\nsphericity violations (Huyndt & Feldt, 1976) and n* values were calculated as\nan estimate of effect size. Simple univariate ANOVAs and pairwise compar-\nisons were performed in order to interpret the hypothesized significant Group\nX Valence interaction for the ECST data. Finally, in order to ascertain whether\nage influenced task performance, WCST and ECST analyses were repeated\nwith participant age entered as a covariate.\n\nResults\nWCST\n\nGroups did not demonstrate any statistically reliable differences\n\n\nFLEXIBILITY FOR EMOTIONAL INFORMATION\n\nThere was no main effect of re mae enon inert of or Valence in the ECST:\n\nhowever, as hypothesized, there was a significant interaction of\n\n(See Figure\n2).

As before, there was a significant interaction of stimulus\nvalence and participant group for the number of perseverative\nerrors, Valence X Group, F(2, 64) = 4.63, p < 02, 7% = 0.13.\nSubsequent simple effects ANOVAS covarying age indicated that\nindividuals with MDD made more perseverative errors than the\ncontrols during the negative ECST block, F(1, 33) = 4.49, p <\n05, m> = 013. Controls exhibited a trend towards making more\nperseverative errors in the positive ECST block relative to the\n\nTable 2\nWCST Performance Means\n\n433\n\nindividuals with MDD, F(1, 33) = 328, p < 08, n> = 09.\nPerseverative error scores did not differ between groups for the\nneutral ECST condition, F(1, 34) = 2.69, p = .11, 7% = 07.\n\nWithin-group comparison with age covaried indicated no effect\nof valence for healthy controls or individuals with MDD, Valence,\nF(2,30) = 20,p > 7, m7 = 013 and Valence, F(2, 32) = 136,\np> 2,m\u00b0 = 08, respectively. However, a post-hoc Neuman-\nKeuls analysis confirmed that the number of perseverative errors\nmade by healthy control participants during the positive block\nremained significantly greater than those in the neutral and nega-\ntive blocks (p < 03 and p < 04, respectively).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe present preliminary investigation aimed to expand the un-\nderstanding of cognitive flexibility processes among individuals\nwith MDD and non-psychiatric controls using a standard neuro-\npsychological paradigm, the WCST, in conjunction with a novel\nemotional modification of the paradigm. In the present sample of\nmoderately depressed participants drawn from the community,\nresults argue against an overall cognitive flexibility deficit in\nindividuals with MDD and suggest that task performance reflects\nan interaction between diagnostic group and the emotional valence\nof the stimuli. Results indicate that individuals with MDD perform\nmore poorly on a cognitive flexibility task when the stimuli are\nnegative relative to controls. Controls also performed more poorly\non the task when the stimuli were positive as compared to neutral\nand negative. Further analyses suggested these findings were un-\nlikely the result of decreased task engagement, because the same\nGroup X Valence interaction was not observed for non-\nperseverative errors, a measure sensitive to overall task engage-\nment and accuracy. Results were also unrelated to participant age.\n\nMood Congruent Inflexibility\n\nAs a group, participants with MDD perseverated when stimuli\nwere negatively valenced relative to healthy controls. This is\nconsistent with the clinical and rumination literatures suggesting\ndecreased flexibility in the presence of negative information and\nsuggests that cognitive flexibility is another process influenced by\nthe emotional valence of the stimuli employed. Further research is\nnecessary to clarify how negative stimuli impact cognitive flexi-\nbility, although many possibilities exist. First, the processing of\nnegative information by dysphoric individuals has been shown to\n\nMean Standard deviation\nCharacteristic Controls MDD Controls MDD F P\nCards 107.28 110.05 26 196 0.16 0.69\nCategories completed 5.17 5.00 13 17 0.11 0.74\nPerseverative errors 9.83 8.42 103 78 022 0.64\nNon-perseverative errors. 1756 2089 115 178 0.46 051\nTotal errors 27.39 2932 209 216 0.08 0.79\n\nNote.\n\nWCST = Wisconsin Card Sorting Task; MDD =\n\nparticipants with major depressive disorder.\n\n\n434\n\nDEVENEY AND DELDIN\n\nog MW positive 0 neutral Bl negative\ns\nHl =\ns p=.068\ngS\nZ *p=.039\ng\ni. |\nHi\n&\nHE\n2\nH\ngo T\nControls MDD\n*p= 025\nFigure 2.

Second, if the processing of negative stimuli recruited brain\nregions essential to performing the tasks to a greater degree in the\nindividuals with MDD, decreased resources in these regions may\nhave reduced executive functioning ability. Third, decreased cog-\nnitive flexibility may reflect an inability to adjust performance in\nresponse to feedback. Individuals with MDD often fail to show an\nincrease in accuracy following feedback that they have made an\nerror, suggesting aberrant responses to task feedback (Elliott et al.,\n1996). However, these studies have not employed emotional stim-\nuli and it is unknown whether the emotional nature of the stimulus\ncan affect responses to feedback.\n\nAlthough the current study does not allow us to distinguish\nbetween these alternative explanations, results suggest that indi-\nviduals with MDD experience decreased cognitive flexibility in\nthe presence of negative stimuli relative to healthy controls. How-\never, our original hypothesis that individuals with MDD would be\nless cognitively flexible when the stimuli were negative as com-\npared to positive or neutral was not confirmed. While this is\nsomewhat surprising given the robust literature on negatively\nbiased cognitive processes in MDD (see Williams et al., 1997 for\nreview), it is consistent with depressive realism theory, indicating\nthat a defining feature of depression is the failure to exhibit the\npositive biases and illusions exhibited by non-depressed controls\n(Alloy & Abramson, 1979, 1988). An extensive cognitive litera-\nture fails to find preferential attention, recall, recognition, and\nreaction to positively valenced information among individuals\nwith depression (Deldin, Deveney, Kim, Casas, & Best, 2001;\nMatt et al., 1992; Sloan, Strauss, & Wisner, 2001). Intact ability to\ninhibit responses in the presence of positive stimuli may lead to an\noverride of more immediate adaptive responses with later and\n\npotentially more negative responses. Similarly, the ability to view\nand respond to positive information more flexibly may allow for\nalternate and less positive interpretations of that information. It is\ntherefore possible that a relative decrease in flexibility when\nstimuli are negative as compared to controls coupled with a lack of\nenhanced perseveration when stimuli are positively valenced, as\nwas exhibited by the controls, may be detrimental to individuals\nwith MDD and may contribute to some of the ruminative and rigid\nstyles of thinking noted in MDD populations (Beck, 1967; Nolen-\nHocksema, 1991).\n\nControl participants were less flexible when the stimuli were\npositively valenced, making more perseverative errors during the\npositive ECST block as compared to the neutral and negatively\nvalenced blocks. This indicated a return to the previous matching\nrule or a difficulty overriding a previous response pattern despite\nreceiving feedback that responses consistent with the old rule were\nincorrect. Healthy controls often demonstrate performance differ-\nences for positive information, including enhanced memory for\npositive words (Matt et al., 1992), enhanced attribution of positive\ncharacteristics to oneself (Brown, 1986), and more positively\nbiased views of the self and the world (Taylor & Brown, 1988,\n1994). Consequently, measurements of cognitive flexibility may\nrepresent another cognitive realm in which positively valenced\ninformation is processed preferentially. Indeed, this preferential\nprocessing may have impaired the control participants ability to\nflexibly shift between different perceptual features of the stimuli.\n\nIn contrast to the current findings, prior work by Isen and\ncolleagues suggests that induced positive moods in a control\npopulation increase performance on cognitive flexibility tasks in-\nvolving non-emotional stimuli (for review sce Ashby et al., 1999).\nHowever, recent work by Phillips and colleagues (2002) demon-\nstrated that induced positive mood impaired performance on ex-\necutive functioning tasks involving forced switching between re-\nsponse patterns as compared to an induced neutral mood. Despite\n\n\nFLEXIBILITY FOR EMOTIONAL INFORMATION 435\n\nthe fact that our healthy controls were presumably experiencing\nmore positive affect than the individuals in the MDD group, they\ndid not exhibit greater cognitive flexibility during the neutral\nECST block or the WCST, a finding somewhat inconsistent with\nthat of Isen and colleagues. However, the focus of our study was\non investigating the impact of the emotional content of the stimuli\non task performance, and we did not induce mood states in our\nparticipants. Investigations of the impact of emotional state on\nspecific cognitive processes may be different than those that eval-\nuate the impact of the emotional content of stimuli on those same\ncognitive processes (Kensinger & Corkin, 2003). Consequently,\nthe ability to process information flexibly may be dependent not\nonly on an individual\u2019s mood, but also on the emotional valence of\nthe stimuli. As this is the first study to investigate cognitive\nflexibility while varying the emotional content of the stimuli,\nfurther research is necessary to clarify the exact nature of the\nimpact of emotional stimuli on cognitive flexibility.\n\nThe differential cognitive flexibility performance as a result of\nstimuli valence by the participant groups is striking given the fact\nindividuals were never directed to, nor needed to pay attention to\nthe meanings of the words in the ECST. Anecdotal reports suggest\nthat many individuals did not actively pay attention to the words\nduring the task, although some participants ( = 5) spontaneously\nclassified the ECST blocks by valence during the study debriefing.\n\nWCST\n\nFinally, our WCST findings are inconsistent with much of the\nresearch noting impairments in depressed populations on the same\nmeasures. One possible explanation for this is that impaired cog-\nnitive functioning is most consistently observed in populations\nwho are older and who have more severe depressions (see Grant et\nal., 2001; Ottowitz, Dougherty, & Savage, 2002 for reviews).\nAlthough the age range in our study was broad (21-63), only three\nparticipants were older than 50 and the mean age was 32. In\naddition, although all participants were currently experiencing a\nmajor depressive episode according to DSM-IV criteria and many\nwere undergoing treatment for depression at the time of testing,\nthey were not recruited from an inpatient setting and may therefore\nreflect a less severely ill population than those used in other\nneuropsychological studies. Several researchers have noted that\nneuropsychological study findings in MDD are less consistent\nwhen younger samples (<40) are employed (Purcell, Maruff,\nKyrior, & Pantelis, 1997), however, it is important to note that\nother studies have noted WCST deficits in younger and dysphoric\npopulations (c.g. Channon, 1996). It is unlikely that our failure to\ndetect significant differences in the WCST resulted from a small\nsample size and insufficient power given that the effect size in our\nstudy (d = 21) was smaller than those in other studies (d = .60).\n\nLimitations\n\nCertain methodological limitations should be considered when\ninterpreting the study results. First, the ECST blocks were limited\nto 88 words per block. Researchers have noted that modified\nversions of the WCST that utilize fewer than the standard 128\ncards may lack the sensitivity necessary to detect performance\ndifferences between depressed and non-depressed individuals\n\n(Fossati, Ergis, & Allilaire, 2001). Consequently, replication of\nthis study using a more comparable number of trials in the ECST\nas in the WCST may better clarify cognitive flexibility for emo-\ntional information in this population.\n\nSecondly, this test was designed to adhere as closely as possible\nto the standard WCST, one of the most commonly used cognitive\nflexibility tasks (Damasio & Anderson, 2003), and therefore the\nemotional content of the words was irrelevant to actual task\ndemands. Further evidence of differential cognitive flexibility for\nemotional information may be detected if valence is a condition on\nwhich to sort or if the task involved individuals needing to switch\nbetween positive, neutral, and negative interpretations of ambigu-\nous stimuli. Based on the rumination literature (Nolen-Hocksema,\n1991) and findings from the present study, individuals with MDD\nmay find it more difficult to shift from negative interpretations of\nstimuli to positive or neutral interpretations of stimuli, while\ncontrols may show difficulty switching from positive\ninterpretations.\n\nThird, because the WCST was always administered first in order\nto maintain the integrity of the task, this study cannot control for\norder effects. However, valence block order was counterbalanced\nacross participants and the specificity of the ECST findings to the\npositive block for controls and the negative block for between\ngroup differences argues against nonspecific or habituation effects.\nIn addition, because all participants completed the WCST prior to\ncompleting the ECST, they were likely more aware of rule changes\nduring all the ECST blocks. Consequently, despite ample \u201cwarn-\ning\u201d that rules would change during the blocks of the ECST, the\ntwo groups still exhibited a relative lack of flexibility for mood\ncongruent stimuli.\n\nFourth, we failed to find the expected correlation between\nparticipant age and neuropsychological task performance (see\nGrant et al., 2001; Ottowitz et al., 2002 for reviews) and analysis\nof WCST and ECST performance were similar regardless of\nwhether participant age was included as a covariate. This may be\ndue in part to a restricted range of participant age. Only three\nparticipants were older than age 50 (M = 32) and therefore would\nnot qualify as \u201colder\u201d for many neuropsychological studies.\n\nFinally, this is a preliminary study with a small sample size.\nFurther research is necessary to replicate these findings and to\ncorrect some of the methodological limitations we experienced\nwith the current sample.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe current preliminary research study suggests that individuals\nwith MDD and those with no history of psychiatric problems\ndemonstrate differential performance on a set-shifting task de-\npending on the emotional nature of the stimuli. These divergent\nstyles of responding to emotionally valenced information may\ncontribute to the relative risk or protection from depressed mood.\n\nReferences\n\nAlloy, L. B., & Abramson, L. Y.
