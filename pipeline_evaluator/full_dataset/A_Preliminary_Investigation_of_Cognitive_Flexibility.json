DeldinUniversity of Michigan-Ann ArborClinical research suggests that individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) are cognitivelyinflexible, exhibiting ruminative, rigid, and automatic thoughts within a negative schema. However,existing neuropsychological research on cognitive flexibility in this population has not employedemotional stimuli. Because research suggests that the performance of individuals with MDD is modulatedwhen emotional stimuli are used, this study investigates the impact of emotional stimuli on cognitiveflexibility performance through a novel emotional modification of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.Controls were less flexible when stimuli were positive and individuals with MDD were less flexible whenstimuli were negative relative to the controls. These divergent styles of responding to emotionalinformation may contribute to the relative risk or protection from depressed mood.Keywords: emotion, depression, cognitive flexibility, Wisconsin Card Sorting TestClinical observations support the existence of restricted andinflexible cognitive processes in individuals with major depressivedisorder (MDD). For example, Beck\u2019s cognitive theory of depres-sion suggests that individuals with depression are stuck in a\u201cnegative loop,\u201d rigidly viewing themselves, the world, and thefuture in accordance with a negative cognitive schema (Beck,1967). Suicidal individuals, who often suffer from MDD, demon-strate inflexible styles of thinking by generating fewer possiblesolutions to problems (Schotte & Clum, 1987) and in viewingdeath as \u201cthe only solution possible to an unendurable level ofmental pain\u201d (Jamison, 1999, p. 5).Cognitive inflexibility may be related to neurological abnormal-ities in populations with depression. The prefrontal cortex, thoughtto be important for performing executive functioning tasks includ-ing cognitive flexibility tasks (Channon, 1996; Damasio & Ander-son, 2003), has been repeatedly noted to be hypoactive in individ-uals with MDD (Baxter et al., 1989; Davidson, 1994; Mayberg etal., 1999). Consequently, impaired cognitive flexibility in thispopulation may stem from hypoactivation of brain regions thoughtto subserve cognitive flexibility abilities.Finally, research using neuropsychological tasks assessing cog-nitive flexibility indicates that depressed populations may havedeficits in this area of cognitive functioning. One of the mostcommonly used tests to assess an individual\u2019s ability to shift setsis the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST). In this task, individ-uals must learn a rule to perform the task correctly and later be ableto adjust their performance when the rule unexpectedly changes.Cognitively flexible individuals easily alter their response patternaccording to feedback, generating and testing new rules. Cogni-tively inflexible individuals persist in performing the task accord-ing to the old rule, despite receiving feedback that their responseis no longer correct (Channon, 1996; Damasio & Anderson, 2003).For example, during the WCST individuals are asked to match a\u201ctarget\u201d card with various shapes to one of several \u201ccategory\u201dcards according to 3 rules: color, number, and type of shape on thecards. These rules switch without warning after a certain numberof correct matches have been completed.Dysphoric undergraduates (Channon, 1996) and individualswith MDD have exhibited impairments on the WCST, suggestingdecreased cognitive flexibility (Austin, Ross, O\u2019Carrol, Ebmeier,& Goodwin, 1992; Grant, Thase & Sweeney, 2001; Kindermann,Kalayam, Brown, Burdick, & Alexopoulos, 2000; Merriam, Thase,Haas, Keshavan, & Sweeney, 1999). However, impairments onthis task are not universally found (Fossati, Amar, Raouz, Ergis, &Allilaire, 1999; Martin, Oren, & Boone, 1991). In addition, under-graduates who ruminate demonstrated decreased WCST perfor-mance as compared to those who do not ruminate (Davis &Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000).Taken together, these literatures suggest that individuals withdepression are characterized by constricted styles of thinking.Because ruminative, rigid, and automatic negative thoughts withina negative schema have been tied with the etiology, maintenance,and exacerbation of depressed mood states, a better understandingof cognitive flexibility and what subcomponent processes may beparticularly aberrant may be important for improving the treatmentand prevention of MDD (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991, 2000; Young,Weinberger, & Beck, 2001).C.

Does aninability to think flexibly play a role in how individuals with MDDprocess emotional information? Might decreased flexibility in thepresence of negative stimuli play a role in the negative ruminativethoughts observed in clinical and experimental studies of MDD? Arobust empirical literature indicates that the emotional nature ofstimuli can influence task performance. Research on numerouscognitive tasks has highlighted the existence of preferential pro-cessing of positive information by non-psychiatric controls ascompared to negative information (e.g. Matt, Vasquez, & Camp-bell, 1992; Taylor & Brown, 1988, 1994). Dysphoric individualsexhibit a similar mood congruency effect, exhibiting preferentialrecall, identification, and delayed color naming of negative stimuli(for a review see Williams, Watts, MacLeod, & Matthews, 1997).Indeed, this unique processing of negative information is a corecomponent of many information-processing models of depression(Bower, 1981; Ingram, 1984), perhaps involving an enhancedprocessing of negative information (Williams et al., 1997).Theoretically, it is likely that cognitive flexibility would beanother cognitive process that is influenced by the emotionalnature of the stimuli. If individuals are likely to preferentiallyprocess or elaborate on mood congruent information as is sug-gested by the clinical and research literatures (Beck, 1967; Wil-liams et al., 1997), this may result in a decrease in resourcesavailable in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, given its importancein cognitive flexibility tasks (Channon, 1996; Damasio & Ander-son, 2003). Similarly, some research suggests that the processingof negative stimuli by dysphoric individuals results in decreasedprocessing of and attending to the non-emotional aspects of thesestimuli (Siegle, Ingram, & Matt, 2002), consequently poor perfor-mance on cognitive flexibility tasks relates to a failure to attend toaspects of the stimuli that are essential to good task performance.Alternatively, mood congruent information may be processedmore quickly and efficiently due to congruency with an activatedcognitive schema (Bower, 1981), and the resulting decrease in taskload may lead to increased flexibility for mood congruentinformation.To date, research on cognitive flexibility has only examined theimpact of induced positive mood upon flexibility for non-emotional stimuli in a healthy population and has not used stan-dard neuropsychological tests of cognitive flexibility (Ashby, Isen,& Turken, 1999). This line of research suggests that the inductionof a positive mood state can increase creative problem solvingskills and spontaneous cognitive flexibility among non-psychiatriccontrols (Ashby et al., 1999; Isen, Daubman, & Nowicki, 1987;Isen, Johnson, Mertz, & Robinson, 1985; for alternate findings seePhillips, Bull, Adams, & Fraser, 2002).Research using neuropsychological tests of cognitive flexibilityin individuals with depression have used non-emotional stimuliand consequently cannot inform us about whether cognitive flex-ibility is influenced by the emotional stimuli used in the task. Afirst step towards understanding the influence of emotion on cog-nitive flexibility processes is to investigate whether performanceon cognitive flexibility processes, measured by standard neuropsy-chological tests, differs depending on the emotional valence of thestimuli employed and the clinical status of the study participants.Current StudyTaken together, the previous literature suggests that the emo-tional nature of many cognitive tasks affects the performance ofindividuals with MDD and non-psychiatric controls (for a reviewsee Williams et al., 1997). It remains unclear whether emotionalstimuli will influence performance on cognitive flexibility tasks innon-depressed and MDD populations and, to the best of ourknowledge, no versions of the WCST have evaluated whether theemotional nature of stimuli affects the ability of individuals to shiftbetween perceptual properties of the stimuli.In the current study, the impact that emotional stimuli have oncognitive flexibility in individuals with MDD and non-psychiatriccontrols was assessed. Specifically, this preliminary study addressedwhether individuals with MDD exhibit poorer performance on acognitive flexibility task when stimuli are negatively valenced. Inaddition, it addressed whether varying the emotional nature of thestimuli would impact the performance of controls on the task. To thisend, participants completed a computerized WCST as well as amodification of this task to include emotional stimuli (ECST). Thefollowing hypotheses were made: (1) individuals with MDD willexhibit decreased flexibility for the negatively valenced words in theECST compared to the positively valenced words; (2) the controlswill exhibit no decrease in flexibility on any valenced block of theECST. No explicit hypotheses were made regarding the WCST be-cause of the inconsistent results in the literature.MethodParticipantsNewspaper advertisements and flyers posted in the Boston area wereused to recruit participants for a series of studies investigating \u201cdepression\u201dor \u201cthoughts and emotions.\u201d Individuals were screened using the StructuredClinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders (4th edition) (DSM-IV), Patient Edition (SCID-I/P), administeredby a doctoral level clinician (PJD) or graduate students in clinical psychol-ogy trained in SCID administration (First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams,1995). Individuals were excluded from the study if they reported or werediagnosed during the SCID interview with cognitive impairments (i.e.,learning disabilities), head injuries resulting in loss of consciousness formore than ten minutes, bipolar disorder, psychosis, current substanceabuse, current or past substance dependence, or seizure disorders.Eighteen individuals (11 women), ages 21 to 63 ( M/H1100533.8, SD/H1100512.6)with a mean education level of 16.3 years (SD /H110051.1) and with no currentor past Axis I psychiatric diagnosis, comprised the control group. Nineteenindividuals (14 women), ages 21 to 58 years (M /H1100532.2, SD/H1100510.2) witha mean education level of 15.7 years (SD /H110051.4) who met DSM-IV criteriafor a current major depressive episode (MDE), comprised the MDD group.Two individuals were experiencing a current MDE superimposed on dys-thymic disorder at the time of testing and 12 met criteria for at least onecurrent anxiety disorder (8 social phobia, 4 generalized anxiety disorder, 1specific phobia, 1 post traumatic stress disorder, 1 panic disorder, 1agoraphobia without panic disorder, and 1 anxiety disorder not otherwisespecified). Other comorbidities included body dysmorphic disorder (1) andsomatoform disorder (1). Eleven individuals had experienced at least oneadditional MDE in the past. Seventeen individuals had received treatmentfor depression in the past and 10 were currently in treatment and taking430 DEVENEY AND DELDINThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Groups did not differ significantly for age,education level, or number of men and women as determined by univariateanalyses of variance (ANOVA) and chi square analyses. See Table 1.Exploratory analyses confirmed that there were no behavioral perfor-mance differences on the WCST and ECST between those individualsdiagnosed with MDD who were taking medications and those who werenot, between those currently receiving treatment and those who were not,and between those with recurrent MDD and those experiencing their firstMDE. Consequently, the MDD group was not separated into separatesubgroups based on medication, treatment, or first episode status.Participants were also administered the vocabulary subtest of the Wechs-ler Adult Intelligence Scale (3rd edition) as a proxy for general intellectualability. There were no group differences on this measure, suggesting thatperformance on the card sorting tasks is not likely to be attributable tointellectual differences between the groups, F(1, 35) /H110050.31, p/H11005.58.MaterialsParticipants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck,Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961), Beck Hopelessness Scale(Beck & Weissman, 1974), and Spielberger Anxiety Inventory\u2013State andTrait Scales (STAIS/T; Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970) as indicesof current depression severity, hopelessness, and present or trait anxietylevels, respectively. Participants also completed the Ruminative ResponsesScale (RRS), Short Form, which assesses the degree to which individualsengage in ruminative behavior in response to depressed mood (Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow, 1991; Treynor, Gonzalez, & Nolen-Hoeksema,2003). Groups differed predictably on self-report scales of depression,anxiety, and rumination as tested by separate univariate ANOVAs.StimuliAll stimuli were created using Microsoft Paint. Each WCST trial consistedof the presentation of one \u201ctrial card\u201d at the bottom of the screen and four \u201ckeycards\u201d at the top of the screen (see Figure 1). The four key cards consisted ofone red triangle, two green circles, three blue stars, and four yellow crosses,respectively. The 128 trial cards consisted of all 64 combinations of color (red,green, yellow, or blue); shape (triangle, circle, star, or cross), and number (1,2, 3, or 4 shapes) presented twice. The order of the trial cards was randomizedand then presented in a fixed sequence so that all individuals saw the sameorder of stimuli.We designed the ECST to be as similar as possible to the WCST and,therefore, although stimuli were emotional in nature, emotional valencewas irrelevant to successful performance on the task (see Figure 1). Thekey cards in the ECST consisted of the word \u201citem\u201d appearing in thefollowing formats: printed once in red ink and Bauhaus 93 font, twice ingreen ink and Curlz MT font, three times in blue ink and italicizedMercurius Script MT Bold font, and four times in brown ink and TimesNew Roman font. The color brown was chosen for the fourth colorcategory (rather than yellow as in the WCST) to make it easier to read thewords in the various fonts.The words that appeared on the ECST trial cards were drawn from theAffective Norms of English Words (ANEW; Bradley & Lang, 1999) set,which includes separate ratings on a 9-point Likert scale for valence andarousal (low scores indicate low arousal or negative valence; see Appendix).Two hundred and sixty-four words were classified into three categories:Figure 1.

Mean valence ratings differedsignificantly between each of the three valence categories, Valence, F(2,261)/H110052829.504, p/H11021.001,/H92572/H110050.97. Arousal ratings also differed betweenthe categories, Arousal, F(2, 261) /H11005100.246, p/H11021.001,/H92572/H110050.43. Positiveand negative stimuli were both significantly more arousing than neutral;however, positive and negative stimuli had equal arousal ratings. Participantswere asked to rate the emotional stimuli according to the self-assessmentmanikin ratings scale used in the initial ANEW ratings (Bradley & Lang,1999) at the end of the testing session. Participants in both groups rated thestimuli similarly to each other and the initial ANEW index group.Words were matched for length and frequency of use (Ku \u02d8cera & Francis,1967). Words were presented in three blocks of 88 words: positive, neutral,and negative. Each word was presented once as a trial card. Trial cardsconsisted of words printed in a combination of the following three factors:colors (red, green, blue, and brown), fonts (Bauhaus 93, Curlz MT, itali-cized Mercurius Script MT Bold, and Times New Roman) and number ofwords on the card (1, 2, 3, and 4). Each word was randomly assigned to afont, color, and number of words. Word order was randomized and thenpresented to participants in a fixed order.ProcedureConsistent with Harvard Institutional Review Board approval, the detailsof the study were explained to all participants and written consent wasobtained. Study participation lasted between three and four hours over thecourse of two days. After completing the SCID in the first session,participants returned to the lab to complete the WCST, ECST, vocabularytest, and questionnaires. Participants were compensated $10 for each hourof their time.Card Sorting TasksAll tasks were performed on a Mac computer using the Psyscopeprogram (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, & Provost, 1993). In both the WCSTand ECST, participants were instructed to match each trial card to one ofthe four key cards as best as they could. They were told that they wouldreceive feedback as to whether they were correct or incorrect after eachmatch and should use that information to decide how to correctly matchsubsequent cards. Consistent with standard WCST administration, partic-ipants were not told what the rules might be, nor that the rules wouldchange in either task. The rules that governed task feedback were color,shape, and number of shapes in the WCST, and color, font, and number ofwords in the ECST. In both the WCST and ECST, once a participant made10 consecutive correct matches according to the operating rule, the com-puter changed the rule. At that point, the participant heard a beep signifyingthat an error had been made and the word \u201cincorrect\u201d appeared at thebottom of the screen when s/he attempted to continue matching under theold rule. The participant needed to discover the new rule and match cardscorrectly according to the new rule to hear a beep signifying that a correctresponse had been given and to see the word \u201ccorrect\u201d printed at the bottomof the screen. The task was terminated when individuals correctly sorted tosix different rules (each of the three rules repeated) or until all of the cardsin the set were used. Rule order was counterbalanced in the WCST andECST. Each rule occurred in each position (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) an equalnumber of times. In the ECST, each rule occurred an equal number of timesin each valence block and an equal number of times in each position (1st,2nd, or 3rd). The ECST was structured so that, for each participant, adifferent rule was in operation at the beginning of each block. In order tobe consistent with the standard administration of the WCST and to providean accurate test of standard cognitive flexibility ability, all participantscompleted the WCST task first to ensure that individuals did not knowabout rule changes before completing this task. Participants then completedthe three blocks of the ECST: one positive, one neutral, and one negativeblock. Block order was counterbalanced across participants with eachvalence block occurring 1st, 2nd, or 3rd an equal number of times.Data Reduction and AnalysisUnivariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to assess groupdifferences for five variables commonly assessed in the WCST: (1) numberof perseverative errors (the number of times the subject continues to sortaccording to an old rule after the rule has changed; higher numbers indicatedecreased cognitive flexibility); (2) number of categories correctly sorted(maximum of six before the task terminated; higher numbers indicateincreased task performance); (3) number of cards used in the test (thenumber of cards to complete six categories and successful rule changes, orthe number of total cards viewed prior to test termination; higher numbersindicate decreased task performance); (4) number of non-perseverativeerrors (the number of times a subject sorted according to a new rule orwhen a sort occurred for a trial card that matched more than one category;higher numbers indicate decreased task performance, but not necessarilyperseveration or decreased cognitive flexibility); and (5) the total numberof errors (sum of perseverative and non-perseverative errors; higher num-bers indicate decreased task performance, including measures of decreasedcognitive flexibility as well as poor performance more generally). We wereparticularly interested in group differences for perseverative errors, thepurest index of cognitive inflexibility; and we analyzed non-perseverativeerrors as well to evaluate whether our findings were specific to inflexibil-ity, rather than to overall poorer task performance reflecting generalcognitive deficits, including decreased task engagement that are not rele-vant to the hypotheses in this project. If participants made more non-perseverative errors during mood congruent blocks, then we would havestrong support that participants were less engaged with the task during themood congruent blocks, potentially reflecting distraction or rumination onthe emotional content of the words. This, in turn, would suggest that anyrelative inflexibility during mood congruent blocks for the two participantgroups was due to decreased task engagement rather than decreased cog-nitive flexibility.ECST data were analyzed using 3 /H110032 repeated measures ANOVAs withstimulus Valence (positive, neutral, negative) as the within-subjects factor andGroup (control, MDD) as the between-subjects factor. Because our hypotheseswere specific for cognitive flexibility, which is best tapped by the number ofperseverative errors made during the task, analyses were computed for thenumber of perseverative errors committed during each ECST block. Highernumbers of perseverative errors in the negative ECST block among individualswith MDD would indicate decreased cognitive flexibility in the presence ofnegative stimuli. In order to test the specificity of these findings to persevera-tive errors and rule out the possibility that distraction or level of task engage-ment accounted for our findings, we conducted the same analysis for non-perseverative errors. The Huyndt-Feldt correction was employed to correct forsphericity violations (Huyndt & Feldt, 1976) and /H92572values were calculated asan estimate of effect size. Simple univariate ANOVAs and pairwise compar-isons were performed in order to interpret the hypothesized significant Group/H11003Valence interaction for the ECST data. Finally, in order to ascertain whetherage influenced task performance, WCST and ECST analyses were repeatedwith participant age entered as a covariate.ResultsWCSTGroups did not demonstrate any statistically reliable differenceson any of the five WCST measures: number of categories, F(1,432 DEVENEY AND DELDINThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

However, a post-hoc Neuman-Keuls analysis confirmed that the number of perseverative errorsmade by healthy control participants during the positive blockremained significantly greater than those in the neutral and nega-tive blocks ( p/H11021.03 and p/H11021.04, respectively).DiscussionThe present preliminary investigation aimed to expand the un-derstanding of cognitive flexibility processes among individualswith MDD and non-psychiatric controls using a standard neuro-psychological paradigm, the WCST, in conjunction with a novelemotional modification of the paradigm. In the present sample ofmoderately depressed participants drawn from the community,results argue against an overall cognitive flexibility deficit inindividuals with MDD and suggest that task performance reflectsan interaction between diagnostic group and the emotional valenceof the stimuli. Results indicate that individuals with MDD performmore poorly on a cognitive flexibility task when the stimuli arenegative relative to controls. Controls also performed more poorlyon the task when the stimuli were positive as compared to neutraland negative. Further analyses suggested these findings were un-likely the result of decreased task engagement, because the sameGroup /H11003Valence interaction was not observed for non-perseverative errors, a measure sensitive to overall task engage-ment and accuracy. Results were also unrelated to participant age.Mood Congruent InflexibilityAs a group, participants with MDD perseverated when stimuliwere negatively valenced relative to healthy controls. This isconsistent with the clinical and rumination literatures suggestingdecreased flexibility in the presence of negative information andsuggests that cognitive flexibility is another process influenced bythe emotional valence of the stimuli employed. Further research isnecessary to clarify how negative stimuli impact cognitive flexi-bility, although many possibilities exist. First, the processing ofnegative information by dysphoric individuals has been shown toTable 2WCST Performance MeansCharacteristicMean Standard deviationFp Controls MDD Controls MDDCards 107.28 110.05 22.6 19.6 0.16 0.69Categories completed 5.17 5.00 1.3 1.7 0.11 0.74Perseverative errors 9.83 8.42 10.3 7.8 0.22 0.64Non-perseverative errors 17.56 20.89 11.5 17.8 0.46 0.51Total errors 27.39 29.32 20.9 21.6 0.08 0.79Note.

Second, if the processing of negative stimuli recruited brainregions essential to performing the tasks to a greater degree in theindividuals with MDD, decreased resources in these regions mayhave reduced executive functioning ability. Third, decreased cog-nitive flexibility may reflect an inability to adjust performance inresponse to feedback. Individuals with MDD often fail to show anincrease in accuracy following feedback that they have made anerror, suggesting aberrant responses to task feedback (Elliott et al.,1996). However, these studies have not employed emotional stim-uli and it is unknown whether the emotional nature of the stimuluscan affect responses to feedback.Although the current study does not allow us to distinguishbetween these alternative explanations, results suggest that indi-viduals with MDD experience decreased cognitive flexibility inthe presence of negative stimuli relative to healthy controls. How-ever, our original hypothesis that individuals with MDD would beless cognitively flexible when the stimuli were negative as com-pared to positive or neutral was not confirmed. While this issomewhat surprising given the robust literature on negativelybiased cognitive processes in MDD (see Williams et al., 1997 forreview), it is consistent with depressive realism theory, indicatingthat a defining feature of depression is the failure to exhibit thepositive biases and illusions exhibited by non-depressed controls(Alloy & Abramson, 1979, 1988). An extensive cognitive litera-ture fails to find preferential attention, recall, recognition, andreaction to positively valenced information among individualswith depression (Deldin, Deveney, Kim, Casas, & Best, 2001;Matt et al., 1992; Sloan, Strauss, & Wisner, 2001). Intact ability toinhibit responses in the presence of positive stimuli may lead to anoverride of more immediate adaptive responses with later andpotentially more negative responses. Similarly, the ability to viewand respond to positive information more flexibly may allow foralternate and less positive interpretations of that information. It istherefore possible that a relative decrease in flexibility whenstimuli are negative as compared to controls coupled with a lack ofenhanced perseveration when stimuli are positively valenced, aswas exhibited by the controls, may be detrimental to individualswith MDD and may contribute to some of the ruminative and rigidstyles of thinking noted in MDD populations (Beck, 1967; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991).Control participants were less flexible when the stimuli werepositively valenced, making more perseverative errors during thepositive ECST block as compared to the neutral and negativelyvalenced blocks. This indicated a return to the previous matchingrule or a difficulty overriding a previous response pattern despitereceiving feedback that responses consistent with the old rule wereincorrect. Healthy controls often demonstrate performance differ-ences for positive information, including enhanced memory forpositive words (Matt et al., 1992), enhanced attribution of positivecharacteristics to oneself (Brown, 1986), and more positivelybiased views of the self and the world (Taylor & Brown, 1988,1994). Consequently, measurements of cognitive flexibility mayrepresent another cognitive realm in which positively valencedinformation is processed preferentially. Indeed, this preferentialprocessing may have impaired the control participants\u2019 ability toflexibly shift between different perceptual features of the stimuli.In contrast to the current findings, prior work by Isen andcolleagues suggests that induced positive moods in a controlpopulation increase performance on cognitive flexibility tasks in-volving non-emotional stimuli (for review see Ashby et al., 1999).However, recent work by Phillips and colleagues (2002) demon-strated that induced positive mood impaired performance on ex-ecutive functioning tasks involving forced switching between re-sponse patterns as compared to an induced neutral mood. DespiteFigure 2.

This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.the fact that our healthy controls were presumably experiencingmore positive affect than the individuals in the MDD group, theydid not exhibit greater cognitive flexibility during the neutralECST block or the WCST, a finding somewhat inconsistent withthat of Isen and colleagues. However, the focus of our study wason investigating the impact of the emotional content of the stimulion task performance, and we did not induce mood states in ourparticipants. Investigations of the impact of emotional state onspecific cognitive processes may be different than those that eval-uate the impact of the emotional content of stimuli on those samecognitive processes (Kensinger & Corkin, 2003). Consequently,the ability to process information flexibly may be dependent notonly on an individual\u2019s mood, but also on the emotional valence ofthe stimuli. As this is the first study to investigate cognitiveflexibility while varying the emotional content of the stimuli,further research is necessary to clarify the exact nature of theimpact of emotional stimuli on cognitive flexibility.The differential cognitive flexibility performance as a result ofstimuli valence by the participant groups is striking given the factindividuals were never directed to, nor needed to pay attention tothe meanings of the words in the ECST. Anecdotal reports suggestthat many individuals did not actively pay attention to the wordsduring the task, although some participants (n /H110055) spontaneouslyclassified the ECST blocks by valence during the study debriefing.WCSTFinally, our WCST findings are inconsistent with much of theresearch noting impairments in depressed populations on the samemeasures. One possible explanation for this is that impaired cog-nitive functioning is most consistently observed in populationswho are older and who have more severe depressions (see Grant etal., 2001; Ottowitz, Dougherty, & Savage, 2002 for reviews).Although the age range in our study was broad (21\u201363), only threeparticipants were older than 50 and the mean age was 32. Inaddition, although all participants were currently experiencing amajor depressive episode according to DSM-IV criteria and manywere undergoing treatment for depression at the time of testing,they were not recruited from an inpatient setting and may thereforereflect a less severely ill population than those used in otherneuropsychological studies. Several researchers have noted thatneuropsychological study findings in MDD are less consistentwhen younger samples (/H1102140) are employed (Purcell, Maruff,Kyrior, & Pantelis, 1997), however, it is important to note thatother studies have noted WCST deficits in younger and dysphoricpopulations (e.g. Channon, 1996). It is unlikely that our failure todetect significant differences in the WCST resulted from a smallsample size and insufficient power given that the effect size in ourstudy (d /H11005.21) was smaller than those in other studies (d /H11005.60).LimitationsCertain methodological limitations should be considered wheninterpreting the study results. First, the ECST blocks were limitedto 88 words per block. Researchers have noted that modifiedversions of the WCST that utilize fewer than the standard 128cards may lack the sensitivity necessary to detect performancedifferences between depressed and non-depressed individuals(Fossati, Ergis, & Allilaire, 2001). Consequently, replication ofthis study using a more comparable number of trials in the ECSTas in the WCST may better clarify cognitive flexibility for emo-tional information in this population.Secondly, this test was designed to adhere as closely as possibleto the standard WCST, one of the most commonly used cognitiveflexibility tasks (Damasio & Anderson, 2003), and therefore theemotional content of the words was irrelevant to actual taskdemands. Further evidence of differential cognitive flexibility foremotional information may be detected if valence is a condition onwhich to sort or if the task involved individuals needing to switchbetween positive, neutral, and negative interpretations of ambigu-ous stimuli. Based on the rumination literature (Nolen-Hoeksema,1991) and findings from the present study, individuals with MDDmay find it more difficult to shift from negative interpretations ofstimuli to positive or neutral interpretations of stimuli, whilecontrols may show difficulty switching from positiveinterpretations.Third, because the WCST was always administered first in orderto maintain the integrity of the task, this study cannot control fororder effects. However, valence block order was counterbalancedacross participants and the specificity of the ECST findings to thepositive block for controls and the negative block for betweengroup differences argues against nonspecific or habituation effects.In addition, because all participants completed the WCST prior tocompleting the ECST, they were likely more aware of rule changesduring all the ECST blocks. Consequently, despite ample \u201cwarn-ing\u201d that rules would change during the blocks of the ECST, thetwo groups still exhibited a relative lack of flexibility for moodcongruent stimuli.Fourth, we failed to find the expected correlation betweenparticipant age and neuropsychological task performance (seeGrant et al., 2001; Ottowitz et al., 2002 for reviews) and analysisof WCST and ECST performance were similar regardless ofwhether participant age was included as a covariate. This may bedue in part to a restricted range of participant age. Only threeparticipants were older than age 50 ( M/H1100532) and therefore wouldnot qualify as \u201colder\u201d for many neuropsychological studies.Finally, this is a preliminary study with a small sample size.Further research is necessary to replicate these findings and tocorrect some of the methodological limitations we experiencedwith the current sample.ConclusionThe current preliminary research study suggests that individualswith MDD and those with no history of psychiatric problemsdemonstrate differential performance on a set-shifting task de-pending on the emotional nature of the stimuli. These divergentstyles of responding to emotionally valenced information maycontribute to the relative risk or protection from depressed mood.ReferencesAlloy, L. B., & Abramson, L. Y. (1979).
