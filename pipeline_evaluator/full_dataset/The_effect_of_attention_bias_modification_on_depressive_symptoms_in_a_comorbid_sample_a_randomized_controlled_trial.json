Studies investigating the long-term effect of attention bias modification (ABM)in clinical samples are lacking. This study investigates the 6-months follow-up effect of ABMon depressive symptoms in participant with major depressive disorder with and withoutcomorbid disorders.Methods. We conducted a double-blind randomized sham-controlled trial in 101 participantsbetween 19 November 2019, and 17 August 2021. Follow-up ended 3 April 2022. Participantswere allocated to ABM or sham condition twice daily for 14 consecutive days. Primary out-comes were the total score on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at 6 months, meanBrief State Rumination Inventory (BSRI) score post-treatment and reduction in BSRI post-treatment. Secondary outcome was change in attentional bias (AB). The trial was preregisteredin ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT 04137367).Results. A total of 118 patients aged 18 \u201365 years were assessed for eligibility, and 101 wererandomized and subjected to intention-to-treat analyses. At 6 months, ABM had no effecton depression and anxiety compared to a sham condition. While rumination decreased dur-ing the intervention, there was no effect of condition on rumination and AB. Predictoranalysis did not reveal differences between participants with ongoing major depressive episodeor comorbid anxiety.Conclusion. Compared to sham training, there was no effect of ABM on depressive symptomsat 6-months follow-up. Since the intervention failed at modifying AB, it is unclear whetherchanges in AB are related to long-term outcomes.IntroductionAttention bias modification (ABM) has shown some promising results as a low-cost interven-tion for reducing depression symptoms in clinical groups (Hallion & Ruscio, 2011 ), but only asmall number of RCTs have been conducted and overall effect size estimates are small (Fodoret al., 2020 ). ABM is a computerized intervention aiming to reduce negative attentional bias(AB). Furthermore, a negative AB is found to be causally related to depressive (Wells &Beevers, 2010 ), and anxiety symptoms (Van Bockstaele et al., 2014 ). Depression is oftencomorbid with other mental disorders (Kessler et al., 1997 ), and comorbidity is associatedwith poorer prognosis (Coplan, Aaronson, Panthangi, & Kim, 2015 ) and more severe psycho-pathology (Kessler et al., 2005 ). Treatments targeting transdiagnostic processes, such asnegative AB, are therefore needed. ABM paradigms which demonstrate a modification ofAB has been found to influence emotional vulnerability (Grafton et al., 2017 ). ABM maytherefore be a viable option for modifying transdiagnostic processes in comorbid samplesand lead to symptom reductionDepression is a disorder characterized by high relapse rates, especially among patients withcomorbid disorders (Burcusa & Iacono, 2007 ), hence treatments should ideally have lastingeffects beyond the effect found when terminating treatment. ABM may produce long-lastingeffects. For example, a study by Yang, Ding, Dai, Peng, and Zhang ( 2015 ) found better out-come in the ABM condition as compared to the waitlist and placebo conditions at 3 monthsin a sample of students with subclinical depressive symptoms. However, the effect was not evi-dent at 7 months follow-up. The same group (Yang, Zhang, Ding, & Xiao, 2016 ) also foundgreater reductions in depressive symptoms for ABM compared to placebo in a sample ofhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722003956  Published online by Cambridge University Pressadolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) at 12 monthsfollow-up. de Voogd et al. ( 2016 ) found reductions in depressivesymptoms among unselected adolescents up to 12 monthsfollowing ABM or attentional training, but no difference whencompared to placebo. Browning, Holmes, Charles, Cowen, andHarmer ( 2012 ) reported beneficial effect on depressive symptoms1 month after ABM in adults with remitted MDD, as did Dai, Hu,and Feng ( 2019 ) in their study including patients with clinicaldepression. However, findings are not equivocally positive. In alarge trial combining ABM and interpretation bias, incidence ofdepression and symptom severity, was similar across the activeand the control condition over 12 months (Basanovic et al.,2020 ). None of the studies reported on comorbidity. Studiesexamining the effects of ABM tend to have a short follow-upperiod, often only assessing the effect immediately after the com-pletion of the intervention (see online Supplemental eTable 2 inreview by Fodor et al., 2020 ). This limits our knowledge regardingthe long-term effect of ABM for depression.Many studies are also limited by a low number of ABM ses-sions, spanning 4 \u201310 sessions (Fodor et al., 2020 ). According toBlackwell ( 2020 ), the low number of sessions contradictsknowledge we have about associative learning, which normallyrequires more and frequent repetitions to produce lasting effects.A notable exception is a recent study by Basanovic et al. ( 2020 ),involving 44 sessions over 52 weeks investigating variousdepression-related outcomes. In our research group we haveexamined an ABM paradigm consisting of 28 sessions over 14consecutive days. This resulted in a small reduction in clinicianrated depression (but not in self-reports), immediately after theintervention (Jonassen et al., 2019 ). The same paradigm waspreviously found by Browning et al. ( 2012 ) to successfullymodify AB. Thus, the intensity and frequency of this paradigmseems to be sufficient to induce meaningful change in AB andsymptoms.Building on our former study, the present study includes par-ticipants with a broader spectrum of depressive symptoms andcomorbid disorders. By targeting a presumed underlying trans-diagnostic mechanism, that is negative AB (Garland & Howard,2013 ), we investigate whether the effect of this intervention alsoupholds in a heterogeneous clinical group that reports havingproblems with depressive symptoms, independent of currentlyexperiencing an ongoing episode of MDD, having comorbid dis-orders, or not. Negative AB is a trait marker apparent in all phasesof MDD (Joormann & Gotlib, 2007 ), and modification of thiscognitive vulnerability marker could both reduce symptom sever-ity and prevent relapse (Browning et al., 2012 ). Rumination isassociated with AB (Hur, Gaul, & Berenbaum, 2019 ) and is atransdiagnostic mechanism mediating the relation betweendepression and anxiety (McLaughlin & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2011 ),and we investigate whether the effect of ABM is mediated bystate rumination and change in state rumination. With the long-term aim of introducing ABM as a viable low-threshold treatmentoption, there is an apparent need for a translational study includ-ing long-term follow-up and a representative sample of partici-pants who self-report depressive symptoms. The aim of thecurrent study is to investigate the long-term effect of ABM ondepressive symptoms, and whether it is mediated by state rumin-ation, in a sample with and without comorbid disorders in a pre-registered trial. Given that symptom reduction is reliant onmodification of AB, we predict that ABM will lead to lower levelsof depressive symptoms compared to a sham condition at6-months follow-up.MethodsStudy designThe present study is a double-blind randomized controlled trialcomparing the effect of ABM v.a sham condition betweenNovember 2019 and April 2022. The study was preregistered atthe US National Institutes of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov) #NCT04137367 and approved by the Regional Committee forMedical and Health Research Ethics (REK S\u00f8r\u00d8st 2019/33).Study populationParticipants aged 18 \u201365 years with \u2018bothersome depression symp-toms \u2019were recruited using local advertisements and social media.Entrance to the trial was via self-referral by phone or online regis-tration. Potential participants were pre-screened by telephonebefore in-person formal clinical evaluation and enrollment tothe trial. Participants gave written informed consent before fur-ther evaluation. Demographic information along with informa-tion about current and past treatments for mental health,including the current use of psychotropic medication, wasobtained. Clinical psychologists or trained psychology studentsconducted a diagnostic interview using the Norwegian versionof the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview PLUS5.0.0 (M.I.N.I.). Inclusion criteria were current or previousMDD, with or without comorbid mental disorders. Exclusion cri-teria were current or former manic episodes, psychotic episodes,or neurological disorders. It is commonly found that patientsexperiencing a major depressive episode fulfill the criteria forbipolar disorder (Angst et al., 2011 ). Therefore, we allowedpatients with bipolar II disorder to enter the trial. Since bipolardisorder involves episodes with mood congruent psychotic symp-toms, we excluded bipolar I disorder as these symptoms requiretreatments which targets other mechanisms compared to whatABM may offer.Eligible participants were invited to return for face-to-facebaseline assessment 2 weeks later wherein self-reported anxietysymptomatology [Beck \u2019s Anxiety Inventory (BAI); Beck, Epstein,Brown, & Steer, 1988a ) and self-reported alcohol consumptionhabits (AUDIT; Saunders, Aasland, Babor, De la Fuente, & Grant,1993) were assessed. See Fig. 1 for details regarding enrollment.Randomization and maskingAllocation to condition occurred once the participant wasincluded in the trial. An independent lab-technician not relatedto the current investigation conducted a simple randomizationof participants by means of lottery draw from slips in a container(1:1 ratio). Both study investigators and participants were blindedto treatment allocation. The code for revealing condition alloca-tion was unlocked in April 2022, after the 6-months follow-updata collection came to an end and after statistical analyses wereconducted.Study interventionParticipants were randomized to receive either ABM or a shamcondition. ABM was a computerized visual dot-probe procedureadopted from Browning et al. ( 2012 ) and identical to the onereported in Jonassen et al. ( 2019 ). The total number of prescribedsessions was 28 for 14 consecutive days (i.e. twice daily). Each ses-sion lasted for approximately 5 \u20137 min and was conducted at6390 Ragnhild B\u00f8 et al.https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722003956  Published online by Cambridge University Presshome on laptops provided by the research group for this purposeonly.Stimuli consisted of pairs of images of faces displaying emo-tional expressions: positive (happy), negative (fear or anger) andneutral. Each stimuli pair was derived from two out of threevalences (positive-negative, negative-neutral, positive-neutral)displayed horizontally in random order, for either 500 or 1000ms. Immediately after, a probe (one or two dots) appeared onthe computer screen in one of the two locations of the previouslydisplayed stimuli. Participants were instructed to as fast andaccurately as possible to indicate the correct number of dots inthe probe. Each session consisted of 96 trials with equal numberof the three stimuli pairs.In the ABM condition, the probe appeared in the location ofthe screen where the relatively more positive stimuli had been dis-played for 87% of the trials, and in the location of the relativelyFig. 1. CONSORT flow diagram.Psychological Medicine 6391https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722003956  Published online by Cambridge University Pressmore negative stimuli for 13% of the trials. By being exposed tothis condition, participants should implicitly learn to deploytheir attention to the location of the relatively more positive stim-uli, thereby developing a less negative AB. In the sham condition,there was no contingency between probe location and stimuli(i.e. the probe appeared in the location of the screen where therelatively more positive stimuli had been displayed for 50% ofthe trials). In all other respects, the sham condition was equalto the active condition.Participants were informed that the trial would investigate therelation between attentional focus and depression. They were alsoinformed about the potential therapeutic properties of ABM andabout the randomization procedure but were kept blind of theirallocation. However, they were not given any details on the differ-ence between conditions.According to the preregistration of the trial, the plan was toinclude an assessment only condition in addition to ABM andthe sham condition. However, due to restraints on conductingresearch during the COVID-19 pandemic, allocation to this con-dition was discontinued after including five participants. Thischange to the protocol was registered in clinicaltrials.gov.Study outcomesThe primary outcome was the Beck \u2019s Depression Inventory-II(BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Carbin, 1988b ) at six-months follow-up.BDI-II is a self-report measure consisting of 21 items assessingdepressive symptoms and attitudes on a four-point Likert scale,ranging from 0 to 3. The questionnaire is among the most com-monly used scales for assessing depression in clinical research.Cronbach \u2019s\u03b1was: \u03b1= 0.870 at baseline, \u03b1= 0.970 post interven-tion, and \u03b1= 0.907 at six-months follow-up.Other primary outcomes were state rumination as measuredby the Brief State Rumination Inventory (BSRI; Marchetti, Mor,Chiorri, & Koster, 2018 ) post-treatment and reduction in BSRIfrom baseline to post-treatment. As stated in the protocol, the ori-ginal plan was to investigate whether (change in) state ruminationmediated the relation between ABM and BDI-II at 6-monthsfollow-up. The BSRI consists of eight items (e.g. \u2018Right now, Iam thinking: Why do I have problems other people don \u2019thave? \u2019) and is a valid and reliable measure of state rumination.Each item is rated on a 100 mm visual analogue scale rangingfrom \u2018completely disagree \u2019to\u2018completely agree \u2019. Before assessingstate rumination, the participants went through a stress inductionprocedure consisting of listening to a recording of an imageryscript that was personalized by autobiographical content (seeB\u00f8 et al., 2022 for details), based on the procedure described bySinha and Tuit ( 2012 ).The secondary outcome was decrease in negative AB frombaseline to post-treatment as measured by a dot probe task.This task is the same as one session of sham condition. AB wascalculated as the difference in reaction time in millisecondsbetween trials where the probe replaced the relatively more nega-tive face v.the more positive face (see Jonassen et al. ( 2019 ) fordetails). Hence, a positive score reflects a relative AB away fromnegative stimuli, while a negative score reflects a relative ABtoward negative stimuli.Sample size and statistical analysisWe estimated a priori that a total of 100 participants would beneeded to detect a difference between ABM and sham condition,with a two-tailed \u03b1of 0.05 and (1- \u03b2) of 0.80. Power calculationwas based on the assumption that 50% of the participants allo-cated to ABM would report a minimum of 3 points reductionon BDI-II at 6 months, compared to 20% of the participants allo-cated to the sham condition. In comparison, in the Jonassen et al.(2019 ) study, 45.1% of the participants in the active conditionreported reductions in depression symptom of this magnitude.That sample consisted of participants with MDD in remissionand comparatively lower symptom levels, thus justifying a slightincrease in the proportion of responders in this trial due to largeropportunity for improvement. According to the National Instituteof Health and Clinical Excellence ( 2009 ), a difference in \u2a7e3BDI-II points is considered a clinically meaningful effect ofdepression treatment. Assuming that 15% of participants wouldbe lost to follow-up, power calculation indicated the need for 50participants in each condition.Baseline characteristics of participants in the two treatmentgroups were reported using frequency distributions and descrip-tive statistics including measures of central tendency and disper-sion. The primary analysis was conducted using anintention-to-treat approach and included all randomized partici-pants who had either baseline and/or follow-up data ( n= 87).Primary outcomes (BDI-II at six-months follow-up, BSRI posttraining, and change in BSRI from baseline to post-intervention),secondary outcome (change in AB), were analyzed using fourmixed-model analyses with random intercepts. For exploratorypurposes we investigated the effect of ABM on anxiety (BAI).We also conducted a predictor analysis, including the interactioneffect between Ongoing MDD/Comorbid anxiety \u00d7 Assessmentpoint \u00d7 Condition in the analysis of BDI-II. This is presented inthe online Supplementary materials.For BDI-II and BAI, the model included condition (ABM,sham training) and assessment point (baseline, post ABM, six-months follow-up) and condition by time interaction as fixedfactors. Due to the different intervals between assessment points,we treat time as a categorical variable. The same specificationswere used for the analysis of BSRI and AB but included twotime points only (baseline and post ABM). The model was fitusing restricted maximum likelihood using the lme4 package inR (Bates, M\u00e4chler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015 ). The ABM treatmenteffect was operationalized as the least squares mean difference atsix-months from this mixed-model repeated measure model.Statistical significance was assessed using the LS mean pvalue < 0.05.If a Condition \u00d7 Assessment point interaction effect [or in thecase of predictor analyses (ongoing MDD or comorbid anxietydisorder): Predictor \u00d7 Condition \u00d7 Assessment point] was signifi-cant, pairwise analysis was used for decomposing the interactioneffect. In case of an effect of ABM, we investigated whether staterumination and change in state rumination mediated the effect.At baseline, 15 participants had missing data on BDI-II, AB,and BAI and 14 participants had missing BSRI data.Participants with missing data at baseline, except for one whohad follow-up data, were not included in the analysis. Missingdata on follow-ups had the following distribution at varioustimepoints; BDI-II post-intervention: ABM n= 13, sham condi-tion n= 10; BDI 6-months follow-up: ABM: n= 13, sham condi-tion n= 12; BSRI post-intervention: ABM n= 12, sham conditionn= 9; AB post-intervention: ABM n= 15, sham condition n=9 ;BAI post-intervention: ABM n= 13, sham condition n= 10; BAI6-months follow-up: ABM n= 13, sham condition n= 12.Missing data were not imputed as analysis with the mixed-modelapproach without any ad hoc imputation is shown to be more6392 Ragnhild B\u00f8 et al.https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722003956  Published online by Cambridge University Presspowerful compared to other alternatives (Chakraborty & Gu,2009 ).All analyses were conducted using SPSS (version 27) and R(version 4.2.0).Role of the funding sourceThe funders of the study had no role in study design, data collec-tion, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.ResultsStudy populationA total of 118 adults were screened for eligibility, and 101 met eli-gibility criteria and were randomized between November 2019and September 2021 ( Fig. 1 ). See Table 1 for baseline demo-graphic and clinical characteristics between participants whowere allocated to ABM or a sham condition. Forty-seven partici-pants fulfilled criteria for MDD, 96 for previous MDD, 24 for dys-thymia, two for hypomania, 12 for previous hypomania, 14 forpanic disorder, 18 for agoraphobia, 31 for social phobia, sevenfor obsessive-compulsive disorder, eight for post-traumatic stressdisorder, 20 for alcohol use disorder, seven for substance use dis-order, and 40 for generalized anxiety disorder. The median num-ber of current mental disorder was three. Seventy-six participantscompleted the trial and provided data at six-months follow-up.While potential baseline differences between study arms werenot subjected to significance testing, as the differences per defin-ition should be at random due to randomization procedure, wenote that the difference in self-reported depression scores corres-pond to what has been deemed as clinically meaningful (3.2BDI-II points; NICE, 2009 ). Prior depression scores are highlypredictive of future depression scores, and the random interceptsin the mixed-model analysis takes into account this differencewhen assessing outcomes.Primary outcomeDepressive symptomsCompared to baseline, there was a significant reduction indepression from baseline to post-treatment, t(196.466) = \u221212.85,p< 0.001, d=\u22121.84, from baseline to six-months follow-up,t(202.100) = \u221210.63, p< 0.001, d=\u22121.50, and from post-treatmentto six-months follow-up t(163.4632) = \u221210.09, p< 0.001, d=\u22121.58. There was no main effect of ABM condition, t(172.375) =1.34, p= 0.18, d= 0.20. There was no significant interaction effectbetween ABM and assessment point from baseline to post-treatment, t(168.810) = 0.018, p= 0.86, d= 0.03, but there was asignificant interaction effect between ABM and assessment pointfrom baseline to six-months follow-up, t(169.170) = 2.54, p=0.012, d= 0.39, and from post-treatment to six-months follow-up,t(150.8753) = 2.25, p= .026, d= 0.37. The interaction effect was inthe opposite direction to what was predicted, that is reduction inthe sham condition, but not in the ABM condition. The resultsshowed a similar reduction in depression from baseline to post-treatment for both groups, and that the symptom developmentdiffered between ABM and sham condition at longer follow-ups,and after treatment termination. At six months, the differencebetween groups was not significant, F(1,74) = 0.876, p= 0.38,\u03b72= 0.20 (see Fig. 2 ). Due to the lack of effect, the planned mediationanalysis was not performed.Conducting pairwise comparisons of assessment points withingroups, we found that in the sham condition, there was a signifi-cant reduction from baseline to post-training, t(40) = 4.32, p<0.001, d= 0.68, and from baseline to six months, t(38) = 5.21,p< 0.001, d= 0.83, but no significant change from post-trainingto six-months follow-up, t(37) = 1.57, p= 0.126, d= 0.25.

The results indicate a similar reduction in anxiety from base-line to post-treatment for both groups, and that the symptomdevelopment differs between groups at longer follow-ups andafter treatment termination, where the sham condition continuesreductions, while the ABM condition does not.Pairwise comparisons of assessment points within groups,showed that in the sham condition, there was a significant reduc-tion from baseline to post-training, t(40) = \u22124.87, p< 0.001, d=\u22120.76, and from baseline to 6 months, t(38) = \u22124.36, p< 0.001,d=\u22120.70, but no significant change from post-training to six-months follow-up, t(37) = 1.34, p= 0.17, d= 0.23. In the ABMcondition, there was a significant reduction from baseline to post-training, t(35) = \u22123.79, p< 0.001, d= 0.63, but not from baselineto six months, t(35) = 0.83, p= 0.41, d= 0.14, and from post-training to six-months follow-up, t(35) = \u22121.19, p= 0.24, d=\u22120.20. The difference between conditions at 6 months was notstatistically significant, F(1,74) = 1.39, p= 0.41, \u03b72= 0.19 (see onlineSupplementary Table S3).For exploratory purposes, we investigated if change in AB(post-intervention AB \u2013baseline AB) was associated with changein depressive symptoms from baseline to post-intervention (post-intervention BDI-II \u2013baseline BDI-II) and six-months follow-up(six-months follow-up BDI-II \u2013baseline BDI-II), respectively.Correlation analyses showed no association between change inAB and change in BDI-II symptoms between either timepointsin either group, or in groups combined, all r\u2019s < 0. 17, p\u2019s > 0.3.DiscussionMain findingsThe current study examined the long-term effect of ABM v.asham condition for depressive symptoms in a sample with andwithout comorbid disorder. At six-months follow-up, there wereno significant differences for either depression or anxiety symp-toms. Both groups reduced depression levels during the 14 daystraining period, but no further reduction was found during six-months follow-up. State rumination was decreased duringintervention, but there were no significant differences betweenconditions. Attention bias was not significantly reduced.Predictor analysis of the effect of ongoing MDD and comorbidanxiety, respectively, on depression symptoms, did not revealany difference.While we did find a general reduction in self-reported depres-sion, anxiety symptoms, and state rumination over the course ofthis trial, the add-on benefit of this intervention compared tothe natural course of symptoms is unknown due to lack of datafrom the discontinued assessment only group.The intervention failed to modify AB which is the proposedmechanism of ABM. It has been argued that modification ofAB is a requirement for ABM to have the intended effect onsymptoms (Grafton et al., 2017 ), hence an effect on symptomsin the ABM group might not be expected. Therefore, the currenttrial was not able to elucidate the relation between reduced ABand long-term depression severity. In general, long-term follow-ups within depression research are challenging, considering thatthe depressive episodes for the majority (63%) of the generalMDD population ultimately tend to reside within six months(Spijker et al., 2002 ), and the reliance on mean values mighthave masked different trajectories in depression symptoms.There is currently no available evidence to support the effect-iveness of ABM in long-term reduction of depressive symptomsin adult populations (see also Basanovic et al., 2020 ; Ferrari,Becker, Smit, Rinck, & Spijker, 2016 for an ongoing trial).However, the current trial failed to have an effect on AB.Therefore, it might be premature to abandon ABM for long-termreduction in depressive symptom based on this study, in particu-lar since the long-term effect of ABM for depressive symptoms inadolescence shows equivocal effects (Yang et al., 2015 ,2016 ). Insummary, the current trial brings the overall effect sizes ofABM for depressive symptoms closer to zero.After ABM, the development of depressive symptoms up to sixmonths was significantly different among groups. While thechange within groups was insignificant, the depressive symptomsamong the active condition increased, while it continued to6394 Ragnhild B\u00f8 et al.https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722003956  Published online by Cambridge University Pressdecrease among the sham condition. We speculate that the differ-ent trajectories might be related to a withdrawal effect from ABMprior to complete recovery. Pertaining to research on antidepres-sants, there are some indications for a rebound effect, i.e. higherrelapse rates or especially severe relapses of depression after thediscontinuation of an antidepressant (Henssler, Heinz, Brandt,& Bschor, 2019 ), and we cannot exclude the possibility of arebound effect among the participants in the ABM group aftertreatment termination. If this be the case, a tapering periodmight be required.This study took place during the covid-19 pandemic and lock-downs, and we do not know how this affected the outcome of thistrial. Implicit tuning of AB through ABM may require face-to-facecontact to reach its full potential (Godlewska & Harmer, 2021 ).Since direct social contact was restricted during the pandemic,it might, although speculative, have limited the effect of ABM.So why did the intervention fail at modifying AB? The inter-vention has previously been successful in modifying AB(Browning et al., 2012 ). The ABM intervention included fearfuland angry facial expression only, and sad facial expressionsmight perhaps have had greater relevance to depression. On theother hand, there has been extensive criticism pointed at the reli-ability of the dot probe task in measuring AB (e.g. Meissel et al.,2022 ), and we cannot exclude the possibility that this affects thesensitivity of this measure in this study also.LimitationsMeasures of depressive symptoms should ideally also include aclinician-rated scale (Uher et al., 2012). Given that a previousstudy only found a reduction in clinician-rated (and not self-reported) depressive symptoms (Jonassen et al., 2019), includinga clinician-rated scale could unveil an ABM effect. Several partici-pants withdrew shortly after randomization; hence, baseline BDI-IIwas missing for several of the participants. This is a limitation andsuggests the need for setting up data collection as to ascertain therecording of important data points at the earliest occasion.Despite the randomization procedure there was a difference indepressive symptoms at baseline which was clinically meaningful(3.2 BDI-II points). Moreover, current MDD was more prevalentin the ABM group. The therapeutic effect of ABM might bedependent on depression severity and the presence of a diagnos-able disorder (Baert, De Raedt, Schacht, & Koster, 2010 ), thoughsymptom severity was not found to moderate the effect of ABMamong patients with remitted MDD (B\u00f8 et al., 2021 ). The pre-dictor analyses, investigating the interaction effect between inter-vention and ongoing MDD/comorbid anxiety disorders, did notreveal any differences based on depression status nor comorbidity.However, analyses were not a priori specified and not subjected topower calculations, nor was randomization procedures stratifiedfor this purpose. The current trial most likely lacks power todetect any but very large predictor effects.The lack of an assessment-only condition limits interferencesof the added benefit of taking part in a structured daily cognitiveactivity beyond the natural course of depressive symptoms.Moreover, the closely matched control condition of the presenttrial might be better apt at delineating mechanism in basicresearch than investigating the effectiveness of ABM in clinicalsetting (Blackwell, Woud, & MacLeod, 2017 ), and future transla-tional studies should reconsider the use of sham training as con-trol condition.ConclusionThis trial showed that there was no effect of ABM on depressivesymptoms at six-months follow-up. These results bring the overalleffect sizes of ABM as a depression intervention further towards zeroand question the presence of long-term effects. However, since theintervention failed to impact the presumed mechanism of the inter-vention (AB), we still do not know whether successful modificationof AB is related to depressive symptoms in the long-term.Supplementary material.
