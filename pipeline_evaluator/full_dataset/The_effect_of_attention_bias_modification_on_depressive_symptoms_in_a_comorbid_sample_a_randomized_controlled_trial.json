Studies investigating the long-term effect of attention bias modification (ABM)\nin clinical samples are lacking. This study investigates the 6-months follow-up effect of ABM\non depressive symptoms in participant with major depressive disorder with and without\ncomorbid disorders.\n\nMethods. We conducted a double-blind randomized sham-controlled trial in 101 participants\nbetween 19 November 2019, and 17 August 2021. Follow-up ended 3 April 2022. Participants\nwere allocated to ABM or sham condition twice daily for 14 consecutive days. Primary out-\ncomes were the total score on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at 6 months, mean\nBrief State Rumination Inventory (BSRI) score post-treatment and reduction in BSRI post-\ntreatment. Secondary outcome was change in attentional bias (AB). The trial was preregistered\nin Clinical Trials.gov (#NCT 04137367).\n\nResults. A total of 118 patients aged 18-65 years were assessed for eligibility, and 101 were\nrandomized and subjected to intention-to-treat analyses. At 6 months, ABM had no effect\non depression and anxiety compared to a sham condition. While rumination decreased dur-\ning the intervention, there was no effect of condition on rumination and AB. Predictor\nanalysis did not reveal differences between participants with ongoing major depressive episode\nor comorbid anxiety.\n\nConclusion. Compared to sham training, there was no effect of ABM on depressive symptoms\nat 6-months follow-up. Since the intervention failed at modifying AB, it is unclear whether\nchanges in AB are related to long-term outcomes.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAttention bias modification (ABM) has shown some promising results as a low-cost interven-\ntion for reducing depression symptoms in clinical groups (Hallion & Ruscio, 2011), but only a\nsmall number of RCTs have been conducted and overall effect size estimates are small (Fodor\net al, 2020). ABM is a computerized intervention aiming to reduce negative attentional bias\n(AB). Furthermore, a negative AB is found to be causally related to depressive (Wells &\nBeevers, 2010), and anxiety symptoms (Van Bockstaele et al, 2014). Depression is often\ncomorbid with other mental disorders (Kessler et al, 1997), and comorbidity is associated\nwith poorer prognosis (Coplan, Aaronson, Panthangi, & Kim, 2015) and more severe psycho-\npathology (Kessler et al, 2005). Treatments targeting transdiagnostic processes, such as\nnegative AB, are therefore needed. ABM paradigms which demonstrate a modification of\nAB has been found to influence emotional vulnerability (Grafton et al, 2017). ABM may\ntherefore be a viable option for modifying transdiagnostic processes in comorbid samples\nand lead to symptom reduction\n\nDepression is a disorder characterized by high relapse rates, especially among patients with\ncomorbid disorders (Burcusa & Iacono, 2007), hence treatments should ideally have lasting\neffects beyond the effect found when terminating treatment. ABM may produce long-lasting\neffects. For example, a study by Yang, Ding, Dai, Peng, and Zhang (2015) found better out-\ncome in the ABM condition as compared to the waitlist and placebo conditions at 3 months\nin a sample of students with subclinical depressive symptoms. However, the effect was not evi-\ndent at 7 months follow-up. The same group (Yang, Zhang, Ding, & Xiao, 2016) also found\ngreater reductions in depressive symptoms for ABM compared to placebo in a sample of\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50033291722003956 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n\u00ae\n\nCheck for\npaates\n\n\n\n6390\n\nadolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) at 12 months\nfollow-up. de Voogd et al. (2016) found reductions in depressive\nsymptoms among unselected adolescents up to 12 months\nfollowing ABM or attentional training, but no difference when\ncompared to placebo. Browning, Holmes, Charles, Cowen, and\nHarmer (2012) reported beneficial effect on depressive symptoms\n1 month after ABM in adults with remitted MDD, as did Dai, Hu,\nand Feng (2019) in their study including patients with clinical\ndepression. However, findings are not equivocally positive. In a\nlarge trial combining ABM and interpretation bias, incidence of\ndepression and symptom severity, was similar across the active\nand the control condition over 12 months (Basanovic et al,\n2020). None of the studies reported on comorbidity. Studies\nexamining the effects of ABM tend to have a short follow-up\nperiod, often only assessing the effect immediately after the com-\npletion of the intervention (see online Supplemental eTable 2 in\nreview by Fodor et al, 2020). This limits our knowledge regarding\nthe long-term effect of ABM for depression.\n\nMany studies are also limited by a low number of ABM ses-\nsions, spanning 4-10 sessions (Fodor et al., 2020). According to\nBlackwell (2020), the low number of sessions contradicts\nknowledge we have about associative learning, which normally\nrequires more and frequent repetitions to produce lasting effects.\nA notable exception is a recent study by Basanovic et al. (2020),\ninvolving 44 sessions over 52 weeks investigating various\ndepression-related outcomes. In our research group we have\nexamined an ABM paradigm consisting of 28 sessions over 14\nconsecutive days. This resulted in a small reduction in clinician\nrated depression (but not in self-reports), immediately after the\nintervention (Jonassen et al., 2019). The same paradigm was\npreviously found by Browning et al. (2012) to successfully\nmodify AB. Thus, the intensity and frequency of this paradigm\nseems to be sufficient to induce meaningful change in AB and\nsymptoms.\n\nBuilding on our former study, the present study includes par-\nticipants with a broader spectrum of depressive symptoms and\ncomorbid disorders. By targeting a presumed underlying trans-\ndiagnostic mechanism, that is negative AB (Garland & Howard,\n2013), we investigate whether the effect of this intervention also\nupholds in a heterogeneous clinical group that reports having\nproblems with depressive symptoms, independent of currently\nexperiencing an ongoing episode of MDD, having comorbid dis-\norders, or not. Negative AB is a trait marker apparent in all phases\nof MDD (Joormann & Gotlib, 2007), and modification of this\ncognitive vulnerability marker could both reduce symptom sever-\nity and prevent relapse (Browning et al, 2012). Rumination is\nassociated with AB (Hur, Gaul, & Berenbaum, 2019) and is a\ntransdiagnostic mechanism mediating the relation between\ndepression and anxiety (McLaughlin & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2011),\nand we investigate whether the effect of ABM is mediated by\nstate rumination and change in state rumination. With the long-\nterm aim of introducing ABM as a viable low-threshold treatment\noption, there is an apparent need for a translational study includ-\ning long-term follow-up and a representative sample of partici-\npants who self-report depressive symptoms. The aim of the\ncurrent study is to investigate the long-term effect of ABM on\ndepressive symptoms, and whether it is mediated by state rumin-\nation, in a sample with and without comorbid disorders in a pre-\nregistered trial. Given that symptom reduction is reliant on\nmodification of AB, we predict that ABM will lead to lower levels\nof depressive symptoms compared to a sham condition at\n6-months follow-up.\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50033291722003956 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nRagnhild Bo et al.\n\nMethods\nStudy design\n\nThe present study is a double-blind randomized controlled trial\ncomparing the effect of ABM v. a sham condition between\nNovember 2019 and April 2022. The study was preregistered at\nthe US National Institutes of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov) #\nNCT04137367 and approved by the Regional Committee for\nMedical and Health Research Ethics (REK Sor@st 2019/33).\n\nStudy population\n\nParticipants aged 18-65 years with \u2018bothersome depression symp-\ntoms\u2019 were recruited using local advertisements and social media.\nEntrance to the trial was via self-referral by phone or online regis-\ntration. Potential participants were pre-screened by telephone\nbefore in-person formal clinical evaluation and enrollment to\nthe trial. Participants gave written informed consent before fur-\nther evaluation. Demographic information along with informa-\ntion about current and past treatments for mental health,\nincluding the current use of psychotropic medication, was\nobtained. Clinical psychologists or trained psychology students\nconducted a diagnostic interview using the Norwegian version\nof the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview PLUS\n500 (MLINL). Inclusion criteria were current or previous\nMDD, with or without comorbid mental disorders. Exclusion cri-\nteria were current or former manic episodes, psychotic episodes,\nor neurological disorders. It is commonly found that patients\nexperiencing a major depressive episode fulfill the criteria for\nbipolar disorder (Angst et al, 2011). Therefore, we allowed\npatients with bipolar II disorder to enter the trial. Since bipolar\ndisorder involves episodes with mood congruent psychotic symp-\ntoms, we excluded bipolar I disorder as these symptoms require\ntreatments which targets other mechanisms compared to what\nABM may offer.\n\nEligible participants were invited to return for face-to-face\nbaseline assessment 2 weeks later wherein self-reported anxiety\nsymptomatology [Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI); Beck, Epstein,\nBrown, & Steer, 1988a) and self-reported alcohol consumption\nhabits (AUDIT; Saunders, Aasland, Babor, De la Fuente, & Grant,\n1993) were assessed. See Fig 1 for details regarding enrollment.\n\nRandomization and masking\n\nAllocation to condition occurred once the participant was\nincluded in the trial. An independent lab-technician not related\nto the current investigation conducted a simple randomization\nof participants by means of lottery draw from slips in a container\n(1:1 ratio). Both study investigators and participants were blinded\nto treatment allocation. The code for revealing condition alloca-\ntion was unlocked in April 2022, after the 6-months follow-up\ndata collection came to an end and after statistical analyses were\nconducted.\n\nStudy intervention\n\nParticipants were randomized to receive either ABM or a sham\ncondition. ABM was a computerized visual dot-probe procedure\nadopted from Browning et al. (2012) and identical to the one\nreported in Jonassen et al. (2019). The total number of prescribed\nsessions was 28 for 14 consecutive days (ie. twice daily). Each ses-\nsion lasted for approximately 5-7 min and was conducted at\n\n\nPsychological Medicine\n\n6391\n\nAssessed for eligibility (=118)\n\nExcluded (n=17)\nNot meeting inclusion criteria (n=4)\n- Declined to participate (1=4)\n- Other reasons (n=9)\n\u00a9 Randomized to assessment\nR only (1=5)\n\u00a9 Not able to get in contact with\n(n=4)\nRandomized (1=101)\n2\n\nAllocated to placebo (n=51)\n- Received allocated intervention (n= 45)\n- Did not receive allocated intervention\nWithdrew before baseline data was\ngathered (n=6)\n\nLost to follow-up (n=3)\n- Notable to get in contact with (n=3)\nDiscontinued intervention (n=3)\n\n- Lack of motivation (n=1)\n- Undisclosed (n=2)\n\nAnalysed (n=45)\n\nNote.

Each stimuli pair was derived from two out of three\nvalences (positive-negative, negative-neutral, positive-neutral)\ndisplayed horizontally in random order, for either 500 or 1000\nms. Immediately after, a probe (one or two dots) appeared on\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50033291722003956 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nAllocated to ABM (n=50)\n- Received allocated intervention (n=42)\n- Did not receive allocated intervention\nWithdrew before baseline data was\ngathered (n=8)\n\nLost to follow-up (n=1)\nNotable to get in contact with (n=1)\nDiscontinued intervention (= 4)\n\n- liiness (n=1)\n- Undisclosed (n=3)\n\nAnalysed (n=42)\n\nthe computer screen in one of the two locations of the previously\ndisplayed stimuli. Participants were instructed to as fast and\naccurately as possible to indicate the correct number of dots in\nthe probe. Each session consisted of 96 trials with equal number\nof the three stimuli pairs.\n\nIn the ABM condition, the probe appeared in the location of\nthe screen where the relatively more positive stimuli had been dis-\nplayed for 87% of the trials, and in the location of the relatively\n\n\n6392\n\nmore negative stimuli for 13% of the trials. By being exposed to\nthis condition, participants should implicitly learn to deploy\ntheir attention to the location of the relatively more positive stim-\nuli, thereby developing a less negative AB. In the sham condition,\nthere was no contingency between probe location and stimuli\n(i.e. the probe appeared in the location of the screen where the\nrelatively more positive stimuli had been displayed for 50% of\nthe trials). In all other respects, the sham condition was equal\nto the active condition.\n\nParticipants were informed that the trial would investigate the\nrelation between attentional focus and depression. They were also\ninformed about the potential therapeutic properties of ABM and\nabout the randomization procedure but were kept blind of their\nallocation. However, they were not given any details on the differ-\nence between conditions.\n\nAccording to the preregistration of the trial, the plan was to\ninclude an assessment only condition in addition to ABM and\nthe sham condition. However, due to restraints on conducting\nresearch during the COVID-19 pandemic, allocation to this con-\ndition was discontinued after including five participants. This\nchange to the protocol was registered in clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nStudy outcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was the Beck\u2019s Depression Inventory-II\n(BDI-IL; Beck, Steer, & Carbin, 1988b) at six-months follow-up.\nBDI-II is a self-report measure consisting of 21 items assessing\ndepressive symptoms and attitudes on a four-point Likert scale,\nranging from 0 to 3. The questionnaire is among the most com-\nmonly used scales for assessing depression in clinical research.\nCronbach\u2019s a was: a= 0.870 at baseline, a= 0.970 post interven-\ntion, and = 0.907 at six-months follow-up.\n\nOther primary outcomes were state rumination as measured\nby the Brief State Rumination Inventory (BSRI; Marchetti, Mor,\nChiorri, & Koster, 2018) post-treatment and reduction in BSRI\nfrom baseline to post-treatment. As stated in the protocol, the ori-\nginal plan was to investigate whether (change in) state rumination\nmediated the relation between ABM and BDI-II at 6-months\nfollow-up. The BSRI consists of eight items (e.g. \u2018Right now, I\nam thinking: Why do I have problems other people don\u2019t\nhave?) and is a valid and reliable measure of state rumination.\nEach item is rated on a 100 mm visual analogue scale ranging\nfrom \u2018completely disagree\u2019 to \u2018completely agree\u2019. Before assessing\nstate rumination, the participants went through a stress induction\nprocedure consisting of listening to a recording of an imagery\nscript that was personalized by autobiographical content (see\nBo et al, 2022 for details), based on the procedure described by\nSinha and Tuit (2012).\n\nThe secondary outcome was decrease in negative AB from\nbaseline to post-treatment as measured by a dot probe task.\nThis task is the same as one session of sham condition. AB was\ncalculated as the difference in reaction time in milliseconds\nbetween trials where the probe replaced the relatively more nega-\ntive face v. the more positive face (see Jonassen et al. (2019) for\ndetails). Hence, a positive score reflects a relative AB away from\nnegative stimuli, while a negative score reflects a relative AB\ntoward negative stimuli.\n\nSample size and statistical analysis\n\nWe estimated a priori that a total of 100 participants would be\nneeded to detect a difference between ABM and sham condition,\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50033291722003956 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nRagnhild Bo et al.\n\nwith a two-tailed & of 0.05 and (1-B) of 0.80. Power calculation\nwas based on the assumption that 50% of the participants allo-\ncated to ABM would report a minimum of 3 points reduction\non BDI-II at 6 months, compared to 20% of the participants allo-\ncated to the sham condition. In comparison, in the Jonassen et al.\n(2019) study, 45.1% of the participants in the active condition\nreported reductions in depression symptom of this magnitude.\nThat sample consisted of participants with MDD in remission\nand comparatively lower symptom levels, thus justifying a slight\nincrease in the proportion of responders in this trial due to larger\nopportunity for improvement. According to the National Institute\nof Health and Clinical Excellence (2009), a difference in >3\nBDI-II points is considered a clinically meaningful effect of\ndepression treatment. Assuming that 15% of participants would\nbe lost to follow-up, power calculation indicated the need for 50\nparticipants in each condition.\n\nBaseline characteristics of participants in the two treatment\ngroups were reported using frequency distributions and descrip-\ntive statistics including measures of central tendency and disper-\nsion. The primary analysis was conducted using an\nintention-to-treat approach and included all randomized partici-\npants who had either baseline and/or follow-up data (n=87).\nPrimary outcomes (BDI-II at six-months follow-up, BSRI post\ntraining, and change in BSRI from baseline to post-intervention),\nsecondary outcome (change in AB), were analyzed using four\nmixed-mode analyses with random intercepts. For exploratory\npurposes we investigated the effect of ABM on anxiety (BAI).\nWe also conducted a predictor analysis, including the interaction\neffect between Ongoing MDD/Comorbid anxiety x Assessment\npoint x Condition in the analysis of BDI-IL This is presented in\nthe online Supplementary materials.\n\nFor BDI-II and BAI, the model included condition (ABM,\nsham training) and assessment point (baseline, post ABM, six-\nmonths follow-up) and condition by time interaction as fixed\nfactors. Due to the different intervals between assessment points,\nwe treat time as a categorical variable. The same specifications\nwere used for the analysis of BSRI and AB but included two\ntime points only (baseline and post ABM). The model was fit\nusing restricted maximum likelihood using the Ime4 package in\nR (Bates, Michler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015). The ABM treatment\neffect was operationalized as the least squares mean difference at\nsix-months from this mixed-model repeated measure model.\nStatistical significance was assessed using the LS mean p value < 0.05.\n\nIf a Condition x Assessment point interaction effect [or in the\ncase of predictor analyses (ongoing MDD or comorbid anxiety\ndisorder): Predictor x Condition x Assessment point] was signifi-\ncant, pairwise analysis was used for decomposing the interaction\neffect. In case of an effect of ABM, we investigated whether state\nrumination and change in state rumination mediated the effect.\n\nAt baseline, 15 participants had missing data on BDI-II, AB,\nand BAI and 14 participants had missing BSRI data.\nParticipants with missing data at baseline, except for one who\nhad follow-up data, were not included in the analysis.

At six months, the difference\nbetween groups was not significant, F74=0.876, p=0.38,\nn\u00b0 = 0.20 (see Fig. 2).

At six-months follow-up, there were\nno significant differences for either depression or anxiety symp-\ntoms. Both groups reduced depression levels during the 14 days\ntraining period, but no further reduction was found during six-\nmonths follow-up. State rumination was decreased during\nintervention, but there were no significant differences between\nconditions. Attention bias was not significantly reduced.\nPredictor analysis of the effect of ongoing MDD and comorbid\nanxiety, respectively, on depression symptoms, did not reveal\nany difference.\n\nWhile we did find a general reduction in self-reported depres-\nsion, anxiety symptoms, and state rumination over the course of\nthis trial, the add-on benefit of this intervention compared to\nthe natural course of symptoms is unknown due to lack of data\nfrom the discontinued assessment only group.\n\nThe intervention failed to modify AB which is the proposed\nmechanism of ABM. It has been argued that modification of\nAB is a requirement for ABM to have the intended effect on\nsymptoms (Grafton et al,, 2017), hence an effect on symptoms\nin the ABM group might not be expected. Therefore, the current\ntrial was not able to elucidate the relation between reduced AB\nand long-term depression severity. In general, long-term follow-\nups within depression research are challenging, considering that\nthe depressive episodes for the majority (63%) of the general\nMDD population ultimately tend to reside within six months\n(Spijker et al, 2002), and the reliance on mean values might\nhave masked different trajectories in depression symptoms.\n\nThere is currently no available evidence to support the effect-\niveness of ABM in long-term reduction of depressive symptoms\nin adult populations (see also Basanovic et al, 2020; Ferrari,\nBecker, Smit, Rinck, & Spijker, 2016 for an ongoing trial).\nHowever, the current trial failed to have an effect on AB.\nTherefore, it might be premature to abandon ABM for long-term\nreduction in depressive symptom based on this study, in particu-\nlar since the long-term effect of ABM for depressive symptoms in\nadolescence shows equivocal effects (Yang et al., 2015, 2016). In\nsummary, the current trial brings the overall effect sizes of\nABM for depressive symptoms closer to zero.\n\nAfter ABM, the development of depressive symptoms up to six\nmonths was significantly different among groups. While the\nchange within groups was insignificant, the depressive symptoms\namong the active condition increased, while it continued to\n\n\nPsychological Medicine\n\ndecrease among the sham condition. We speculate that the differ-\nent trajectories might be related to a withdrawal effect from ABM\nprior to complete recovery. Pertaining to research on antidepres-\nsants, there are some indications for a rebound effect, i.e. higher\nrelapse rates or especially severe relapses of depression after the\ndiscontinuation of an antidepressant (Henssler, Heinz, Brandt,\n& Bschor, 2019), and we cannot exclude the possibility of a\nrebound effect among the participants in the ABM group after\ntreatment termination. If this be the case, a tapering period\n\u2018might be required.\n\nThis study took place during the covid-19 pandemic and lock-\ndowns, and we do not know how this affected the outcome of this\ntrial. Implicit tuning of AB through ABM may require face-to-face\ncontact to reach its full potential (Godlewska & Harmer, 2021).\nSince direct social contact was restricted during the pandemic,\nit might, although speculative, have limited the effect of ABM.\n\nSo why did the intervention fail at modifying AB? The inter-\nvention has previously been successful in modifying AB\n(Browning et al, 2012). The ABM intervention included fearful\nand angry facial expression only, and sad facial expressions\n\u2018might perhaps have had greater relevance to depression. On the\nother hand, there has been extensive criticism pointed at the reli-\nability of the dot probe task in measuring AB (e.g. Meissel et al,\n2022), and we cannot exclude the possibility that this affects the\nsensitivity of this measure in this study also.\n\nLimitations\n\nMeasures of depressive symptoms should ideally also include a\nclinician-rated scale (Uher et al, 2012). Given that a previous\nstudy only found a reduction in clinician-rated (and not self-\nreported) depressive symptoms (Jonassen et al, 2019), including\na clinician-rated scale could unveil an ABM effect. Several partici-\npants withdrew shortly after randomization; hence, baseline BDI-IT\nwas missing for several of the participants. This is a limitation and\nsuggests the need for setting up data collection as to ascertain the\nrecording of important data points at the earliest occasion.\n\nDespite the randomization procedure there was a difference in\ndepressive symptoms at baseline which was clinically meaningful\n(3.2 BDL-II points). Moreover, current MDD was more prevalent\nin the ABM group. The therapeutic effect of ABM might be\ndependent on depression severity and the presence of a diagnos-\nable disorder (Baert, De Raedt, Schacht, & Koster, 2010), though\nsymptom severity was not found to moderate the effect of ABM\namong patients with remitted MDD (Bo et al., 2021). The pre-\ndictor analyses, investigating the interaction effect between inter-\nvention and ongoing MDD/comorbid anxiety disorders, did not\nreveal any differences based on depression status nor comorbidity.\nHowever, analyses were not a priori specified and not subjected to\npower calculations, nor was randomization procedures stratified\nfor this purpose. The current trial most likely lacks power to\ndetect any but very large predictor effects.\n\nThe lack of an assessment-only condition limits interferences\nof the added benefit of taking part in a structured daily cognitive\nactivity beyond the natural course of depressive symptoms.\nMoreover, the closely matched control condition of the present\ntrial might be better apt at delineating mechanism in basic\nresearch than investigating the effectiveness of ABM in clinical\nsetting (Blackwell, Woud, & MacLeod, 2017), and future transla-\ntional studies should reconsider the use of sham training as con-\ntrol condition.\n\nhitps://dol.org/10.1017/50033291722003956 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n6395\n\nConclusion\n\nThis trial showed that there was no effect of ABM on depressive\nsymptoms at six-months follow-up. These results bring the overall\neffect sizes of ABM asa depression intervention further towards zero\nand question the presence of long-term effects. However, since the\nintervention failed to impact the presumed mechanism of the inter-\nvention (AB), we still do not know whether successful modification\nof AB is related to depressive symptoms in the long-term.\n\nSupplementary material.
