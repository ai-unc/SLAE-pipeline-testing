Introduction\n\nSuicide is the third leading cause of death for 10-14 year olds\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012) and thus\nconstitutes a serious problem in childhood and adolescence. In-\ndeed, between 11.6% and 24.5% of 6th through 8th grade students\nreport having seriously thought about killing themselves at some\npoint in their lives (CDC, 2013). Given that rates of self-harming\nthoughts and behaviors increase dramatically during the transition\nfrom childhood to adolescence (eg, Kessler et al, 2005), under-\nstanding the factors that make children more likely to start con-\nsidering suicide might aid in early suicide risk detection and\nprevention.\n\nAlthough maternal history of depression is one of the strongest\nrisk factors for internalizing disorders in youth (Goodman et al.,\n2011), few studies have examined the ways in which maternal\ndepression may increase risk for suicidal ideation (SI) in their\nchildren. For example, there is evidence showing that children of\ndepressed, compared to never depressed, mothers are more likely\nto report SI by adolescence (e.g. Klimes-Dougan et al, 1999), a link\nthat is at least partially independent of offspring psychopathology\n(Hammerton et al, 2015). However, the factors that account for the\n\n* Correspondence to: Department of Psychology, Binghamton University (SUNY),\n4400 Vestal Parkway East, Binghamton, NY 13902, United States.\nE-mail address: atsypes1@binghamton.edu (A.

In addition,\ndespite the fact that not all children of depressed mothers ex-\nperience suicidal thinking, little is known about specific factors\nthat may differentiate those who experience suicidal thoughts\nfrom those who do not.\n\nOne potential mechanism of risk is the development of cogni-\ntive vulnerabilities that put children at risk for future suicidality.\nTo date, the majority of research in this area has focused on cog-\nnitive vulnerability to depression and there is evidence that chil-\ndren of depressed mothers exhibit higher levels of different forms\nof these cognitive vulnerabilities than do children of never de-\npressed mothers (for a review, see Gotlib and Colich, 2014).\nHowever, much less is known about how these cognitive styles\nmay be associated with suicidality, particularly in children. This\nsaid, there is growing evidence from studies of adults suggesting\nthat the various cognitive vulnerabilities featured in some of the\nleading cognitive theories of depression, including hopelessness\ntheory (Abramson et al, 1998) and response styles theory (Nolen-\nHoeksema, 1991), may also increase risk for suicidal ideation and\nattempts.\n\nAccording to the hopelessness theory of suicide (Abramson\netal, 1998), a negative inferential style, defined as the tendency to\nattribute the causes of negative events to stable and global causes\nand to infer negative consequences and negative self-implications\nfrom the occurrence of these events, may increase risk for suicidal\nthoughts and behaviors. According to the response styles theory\n(Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991), the tendency to ruminate in response to\n\n\n100 A. Tsypes, BE. Gibb / Psychiatry Research 239 (2016) 99-104\n\na negative mood increases risk for depression. More recent re-\nsearch has identified two subtypes of rumination — brooding and\nreflection — with evidence that brooding rumination is more\nstrongly related to depression and suicide-relevant outcomes (e.\nNolen-Hoeksema et al, 2008). Importantly, the vulnerabilities\nfeatured in these theories have been shown to predict prospective\nincreases in SI in adults (e.g. Abramson et al., 1998; Beevers, and\nMiller, 2004; Miranda and Nolen-Hoeksema, 2007; Ranieri et al.,\n1987; Smith et al,, 2006). We should also note that hopelessness,\nwhich is prominently featured in the hopelessness theory, is a\nwell-known risk factor for suicidal ideation, attempts, and deaths\nin adults (eg, Beck et al, 1993).\n\nAlthough significantly fewer studies have tested these cognitive\ntheories in youth, there is some evidence that the findings from\nstudies with adults generalize to children and adolescents. For\nexample, one cross-sectional study of a large community sample\nof adolescents found that adolescents reporting SI, compared to\nthose without SI, exhibited higher levels of hopelessness and a\nmore negative attributional style (Labelle et al, 2013). Relatedly,\nhopelessness predicted suicide-related behaviors (i.e. suicide at-\ntempt or self-harm) in a sample of depressed children and ado-\nlescents, an effect that was at least partially independent of chil-\ndren's current depressive symptoms (Hetrick et al, 2012), Finally, a\nrecent prospective study found that adolescents’ negative in-\nferential styles and rumination predicted the occurrence of SI\nduring a two-year follow-up (Burke et al., 2015).\n\nIn contrast to each of the cognitive theories described above,\nwhich were initially developed to explain depression risk in adults\nand then extended to examine risk in children, Cole (1991) com-\npetency-based model was developed specifically for children and\nfocuses on children’s self-perceived competence in various do-\nmains as well as more global levels of perceived self worth. Sup-\nporting this model, a number of cross-sectional and longitudinal\nstudies have documented the relations between self-perceived\ncompetence in various domains and children’s depressive symp-\ntoms (e.g., Cole et al, 1996; Dallaire et al., 2008; Uhrlass et al.,\n2008). There is also preliminary evidence for the link between\nperceived social competence and SI in youth (King et al, 2001).\nFurther, a recent study found that self-esteem was a unique pre-\ndictor of SI in children with bipolar disorder (Weinstein et al,\n2015). However, it is unclear whether children’s self-perceived\ncompetence in social or academic domains, or their more global\nlevels of perceived self-worth, prospectively predicts first onsets of\nSIL.\n\nIn summary, although there is strong support for the hypoth-\nesis that the vulnerabilities featured in leading cognitive theories\nof depression increase risk for depression and suicide-related\noutcomes in adults, and depression in children, less is known\nabout the relation between these cognitive vulnerabilities and SI\nin children, and no study of which we are aware has tested the\npredictive validity of these vulnerabilities in children known to be\nat risk for depression and suicide due to a positive family history of\nmajor depressive disorder (MDD). The goal of the current study\nwas to address this gap in the literature in two ways. First, focusing\non cross-sectional analyses, we examined whether children of\ndepressed mothers who reported a history of suicidal thinking at\nthe baseline assessment (Mom MDD/Child SI group) would exhibit\nhigher levels of each of the cognitive vulnerabilities compared to\nchildren of depressed mothers without a history of suicidal\nthinking at baseline (Mom MDD/No Child SI) and children of\nnondepressed mothers without a history of suicidal thinking at\nbaseline (Controls). Second, using survival analyses, we examined\nwhether any of the specific cognitive vulnerabilities would predict\ntime to first onsets of Sl in children of depressed mothers with no\nprior SI history.\n\nThis is the first study to examine the cognitions that\n\ndifferentiate children of depressed mothers with and without SI as\nwell as the first to test cognitive models regarding first onsets of SI\nin children. Importantly, we focus on a broad range of cognitive\nvulnerabilities proposed by the leading cognitive theories, which\nallows for a more comprehensive and fine-grained examination of\nthese vulnerabilities. In addition, we sought to determine whether\nany significant findings would be maintained after statistically\ncontrolling for children’s levels of depressive symptoms at the\nbaseline assessment and for the onset of MDD during the follow-\nup to ensure that the effect of children’s cognitions was at least\npartially independent of current mood and the occurrence of\nMDD. Finally, given a strong evidence for the familial transmission\nof suicidal behavior (for a review, see Brent and Melhem, 2008),\nwe also sought to examine whether the significant findings would\nbe maintained after statistically controlling for the maternal sui-\ncide attempt history.\n\n2. Method\n21. Participants\n\nParticipants were 209 mother-child pairs recruited from the\ncommunity through a variety of means. To qualify for the study,\nmothers were required to either meet criteria for MDD during the\nchild's lifetime (n=115), according to the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders — Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; American\nPsychiatric Association, 2000), or have no lifetime diagnosis of any\nDSM-IV mood disorder and no current Axis I diagnosis (n=94). For\nthe purposes of the current study, participants comprised three\ngroups based on maternal history of depression and children's\nhistory of suicidal ideation: Mom MDDJChild SI (n=37); Mom\nMDD/No Child SI (1=78); Controls without maternal MDD and\nchild SI (n=94). At baseline, the average age of the mothers was\n40.47 years (SD=6.87, Range=24-55; 87.6% Caucasian) and the\naverage age of the children was 10.90 years (SD=1.93, Range=8-\n14; 52.2% girls; 813% Caucasian). The median annual family in-\ncome was $50,001 to 55,000.\n\n2.2. Measures\n\nThe Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders\n(SCID-I; First et al., 1995) and the Schedule for Affective Disorders\nand Schizophrenia for School-Age Children — Present and Lifetime\nVersion (K-SADS-PL; Kaufman et al., 1997) were used to assess for\ncurrent and past DSM-IV Axis | disorders in mothers and their\nchildren, respectively. The SCID-I and K-SADS-L were administered\nat the baseline assessment and the K-SADS-L was administered\nagain at each follow-up assessment, which was completed every\n6 months for 2 years. As part of the K-SADS-PL interviews at each\nassessment, interviewers assessed for the presence of SI in chil-\ndren by asking the questions “Sometimes children who get upset\nor feel bad, wish they were dead or feel they'd be better off dead.\nHave you ever had these types of thoughts?” and “Sometimes\nchildren who get upset or feel bad think about dying or even\nkilling themselves. Do you have these thoughts?” The initial as-\nsessment focused on children's lifetime history of SI and each\nfollow-up assessment focused on any thoughts that had occurred\nsince the previous interview. At baseline, 34 children answered\n“yes” to the first SI assessment question, 14 children answered\n“yes” to the second SI assessment question, and 11 children en-\ndorsed both of these items. A total of 27 children reported first\nonsets of SI during the study follow-up. All of these children an-\nswered “yes” to the first SI assessment question and 11 also an-\nswered “yes” to the second question.\n\nCognitive vulnerabilities were examined through the use of a\n\n\nA Tsypes, BE. Gibb / Psychiatry Research 239 (2016) 99-104 101\n\nnumber of well-established self-report questionnaires. Children’s\ninferential styles were assessed via the Children’s Attributional\nStyle Questionnaire (CASQ; Seligman et al, 1984) and the Chil-\ndren's Cognitive Style Questionnaire (CCSQ; Abela, 2001). The in-\nternal consistency for the CASQ was 0.46, which is similar to that\nobtained in previous research (e.g, Abela, 2001; Abela and Payne,\n2003; Cunningham, 2003). The internal consistencies for the\nCCSQ-Consequences (tendency to infer negative consequences\nfollowing negative events) and CCSQ-Self (tendency to infer ne-\ngative self-characteristics following the occurrence of negative\nevents) were 0.76 and 0.75, respectively. Children’s levels of ne-\ngative expectancies for the future were assessed using the Hope-\nlessness Scale for Children (HSC; Kazdin et al., 1986). The internal\nconsistency of HSC was 0.45. Levels of rumination were assessed\nusing the Children’s Response Style Scale (CRSS; Ziegert and\nKistner, 2002). The consistencies for the brooding and reflection\nsubscales were 0.69 and 0.68, respectively. The Self-Perception\nProfile for Children (SPPC; Harter, 1985) was used to assess chil-\ndren's levels of self-perceived competence. The present study fo-\ncused on the global self-worth (SPPC-GSW), social acceptance\n(SPPC-SA), and scholastic competence (SPPC-SC) domains. The\ninternal consistencies for these domains were 0.79, 0.77, and 0.79,\nrespectively.\n\nChildren’s symptoms of depression were assessed using the\nChildren’s Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1981). The internal\nconsistency for the CDI was 0.84. In order to avoid potential con-\nfounding due to the fact that SI is one of CDI symptoms, CDI total\nscores for all of the analyses were calculated excluding the item\nthat assesses SI.\n\nMaternal suicide attempt (SA) history was assessed via the\nSuicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R; Osman et al,\n2001), Specifically, the participants who chose the response option\n“I attempted to kill myself, and really hoped to die” when an-\nswering the first question of this questionnaire (ie. “Have you\never thought about or attempted to kill yourself in your lifetime?”)\nwere coded as having made a previous SA. A total of 22 mothers\n(10.5%) endorsed a history of SA.\n\n3. Results\n\nDescriptive statistics for the study variables are presented in\nTable 1 and correlations among the variables are presented in\nTable 2. Focusing first on baseline differences between the three\ngroups of children on the cognitive vulnerabilities and depressive\nsymptoms, we conducted a series of one-way ANOVAs with sig-\nnificant results followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. We found\nsignificant group differences in CASQ-Generality, CRSS-Brooding,\nHSC, SPPC-GSW, SPPC-SC, SPPC-SA, and CDI (see Table 1 for more\ndetails). To examine the robustness of the differences in chil-\ndren's cognitive vulnerabilities, we repeated the analyses, sta-\ntistically controlling for the potential influence of childrens\n\nbaseline depressive symptoms.

Limiting our sample to control children\n(ie, child of mothers with no history of depression), we found that\nHSC, Wald=4.96, p=0.01, OR=140, SPPC-GSW, Wald=6.59,\np=0.002, OR=0.30, and SPPC-SA, Wald=2.21, p=0.04, OR=0.51\npredicted first onsets of SI over the course of the 2-year follow-up,\nlargely mirroring the effects seen in our high risk children. The\nfindings for HSC and SPPC-SA were also maintained even after\nstatistically controlling for the occurrence of MDD during the fol-\nlow up in these children. However, given the small number of\ncontrol children who developed SI during the follow-up, these\nresults should be interpreted with caution.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe first goal of the present study was to determine whether\nchildren of depressed mothers with a history SI at the baseline\nassessment endorsed higher levels of the cognitive vulnerabilities\nfeatured in leading cognitive theories of depression, compared to\nchildren of depressed mothers without a history of SI at baseline\nand to children of nondepressed mothers without a history of SI at\nbaseline. We found that children of depressed mothers who had\npreviously experienced SI themselves reported significantly higher\nlevels of brooding rumination than children in either of the other\n\n\nA Tsypes, BE. Gibb / Psychiatry Research 239 (2016) 99-104 103\n\ntwo groups. In addition, children of depressed mothers, with or\nwithout a personal history of SI reported significantly more ne-\ngative inferential styles for the causes of negative events and\nhopelessness, and significantly lower levels of global self-worth\nand self-perceived scholastic competence and social acceptance\ncompared to children of never depressed mothers. The second goal\nof the study was to examine whether any of the cognitive vul-\nnerabilities examined would predict time to first onset of SI in\nchildren of depressed mothers with no prior history of SI. We\nfound that higher levels of hopelessness and lower levels of global\nself-worth significantly predicted a shorter time to first onset of SI\nin these children. Importantly, these findings appeared to be in-\ndependent of maternal SA history and at least partially in-\ndependent of the influence of children’s baseline levels of de-\npression and the occurrence of MDD during the follow-up.\n\nIt is notable that only brooding rumination differentiated\nchildren of depressed mothers with and without a personal his-\ntory of SI at the baseline assessment. This finding along with the\nfact that brooding did not predict first onsets of SI in our survival\nanalyses suggest that brooding may reflect a correlate or con-\nsequence of SI in children rather than a prospective risk factor.\nFuture research is needed to more definitely determine the tem-\nporal relation between brooding and SI in children. In contrast,\nhopelessness and global self-worth differentiated children of de-\npressed mothers with and without SI from controls at the baseline\nassessment and predicted first onsets of suicidal ideation over the\nfollow up. This is exactly what one would want to see in a true risk\nfactor. That is, one would want to observe similar levels of the risk\nfactor in children with and without prior SI and then demonstrate\nthat this risk factor predicts first onset of SI among children with\nno prior history. These two cognitive vulnerabilities, therefore,\nmay have promise in identifying which children of depressed\nmothers are at greatest risk for developing SI in the future. Inter-\nestingly, we also found that the same cognitive vulnerabilities\npredicted the first onsets of SI over the course of the 2-year follow-\nup in children of mothers with no history of depression (i.e.\ncontrol children). Although caution should be used in interpreting\nthese results due to the small number of these children, the\nfindings suggest that these cognitive vulnerabilities might be im-\nportant to consider in all young people. Finally, with the exception\nof SPPC-Social Acceptance in the control children, other cognitive\nvulnerabilities including negative inferential styles for the causes\nof negative events, self-perceived scholastic competence and self-\nperceived social acceptance appear to be nonspecific vulner-\nabilities associated with maternal history of depression, without\nany specificity to children’s past or future SI.\n\nDespite strong evidence for the predictive validity of hope-\nlessness in this study, we should note that HSC demonstrated low\ninternal consistency in our sample. There are several potential\nexplanations for this. First, HSC has been shown to exhibit lower\ninternal consistency when utilized with nonclinical samples,\ncompared to clinical samples (eg, Prinstein et al, 2008; Spirito\net al. 1988). Second, a comparison of the studies that utilized HSC\nin child versus adolescent samples reveals a generally lower in-\nternal consistency of the scale in children (e.g, Weinstein et al,\n2015), compared to adolescents (e.g. Prinstein et al., 2008). Finally,\na surprisingly large number of studies that have utilized HSC have\nnot reported the internal consistency of the measure in their\nsample (e.g. Aglan et al., 2008; Hetrick et al, 2012; Yilmaz and\nTurkum, 2008). It will be important for future research, therefore,\nto (i) report the internal consistency of the scale in their sample,\nwhich will allow a better understanding of the types of samples\nand conditions that lead to higher versus lower internal con-\nsistency of the scale and (ii) consider the development of alternate\nmeasures of hopelessness in children that would have stronger\ninternal consistency. Finally, we should note that hopelessness is a\n\nfairly abstract construct and it may simply be that it is not well\nenough developed in children to exhibit strong internal con-\nsistency despite the fact that it displays strong predictive validity.\n\nThe present study had a number of strengths, including the\nmulti-wave prospective design, the focus on a high-risk sample,\nand the use of structured interviews with multiple informants (i.e.\nparent and child reports) to assess the presence of SI in children.\nImportantly, the current study is the first to our knowledge to\ncomprehensively examine the cognitions that differentiate chil-\ndren of depressed mothers with and without SI as well as to test\nsome of the leading cognitive models with regard to first onsets of\nSl in these children. This said, the study also exhibited some lim-\nitations that might provide directions for future studies. First, only\nthe presence or absence of SI in children was assessed. Future\nresearch should examine how specific cognitive vulnerabilities\nrelate to characteristics of SI, including its content, frequency,\nduration, severity, and controllability. Second, the cross-sectional\nanalyses focused on children’s lifetime history of SI whereas the\nassessment of cognitive vulnerabilities focused on the current le-\nvels of each variable. Therefore, it is possible that stronger rela-\ntions would have been observed for other cognitive vulnerabilities\nif we had been able to focus on concurrent levels of SI (e.g., spe-\ncifically recruiting children with and without current SI). Third,\ndue to the demographics of the recruitment area, our sample was\nraciallyfethnically homogenous, which might limit the general-\nizability of our findings to other populations and geographic areas.\nFourth, due to the low internal consistency of HSC in our sample,\nadditional studies are needed in order to replicate our findings\nwith regard. We should also note that the reliability of the CASQ\nwas also low, which, although consistent with other research (e.g.\nAbela, 2001; Abela and Payne, 2003; Cunningham, 2003), may\nhave reduced our power to detect significant effects with this\nmeasure. Fourth, we specifically chose to focus on cognitive vul-\nnerabilities featured in each of the leading cognitive theories,\nwhich increased the overall number of analyses and could have\nincreased our risk of Type 1 error. Future studies, therefore, are\nnecessary to replicate the current findings before any firm con-\nclusions can be drawn. Finally, the relatively small sample size\navailable for the prospective analyses limited the statistical power\nof our exploratory moderation analyses; future studies, therefore,\nare needed to determine whether the predictive validity of the\ncognitive vulnerabilities may differ based on child age and/or sex.\n\nIn summary, the present study makes several important con-\ntributions to the literature. Specifically, whereas extant research\non cognitive vulnerabilities has focused primarily on risk for de-\npression and suicidality in adults and depression in children, the\ncurrent study focused on a broad range of cognitive vulnerabilities\nproposed by a number of leading cognitive theories of depression\nand their relation to both the lifetime history and the emergence\nof Sl in children. Our findings extend the literature by suggesting\nthat children of depressed mothers who have thought about sui-\ncide exhibit higher levels of brooding rumination than children of\ndepressed or nondepressed mothers who have never thought\nabout suicide. Importantly, hopelessness and global self-worth\nmight constitute specific forms of cognitive vulnerability that\nprospectively predict first onset of SI in children at-risk by virtue\nof maternal depression history. These findings might have im-\nportant implications for early suicide prevention in these children,\nsuggesting that targeting their levels of brooding, hopelessness,\nand perception of self-worth might attenuate children’s risk for\nsuicidality. More specifically, although originally developed for\nadults, children at risk for SI might also benefit from the inter-\nventions that target self-esteem, such as Child- and Family-Fo-\ncused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (West et al, 2014) and\nbrooding rumination, such as Rumination-Focused Cognitive Be-\nhavioral Therapy (Watkins et al, 2011) and Mindfulness-Based\n\n\n"
