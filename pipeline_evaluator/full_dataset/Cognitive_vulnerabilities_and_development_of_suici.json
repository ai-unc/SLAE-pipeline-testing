Parti-cipants were 209 mothers (aged 24-55) and their 8-14 year old children. Children of depressed motherswho had previously experienced suicidal ideation themselves reported higher levels of brooding rumi-nation than children of depressed mothers who had not experienced suicidal ideation as well as childrenof never depressed mothers who had not experienced suicidal ideation. Further, among children ofdepressed mothers with no prior history of suicidal ideation, higher levels of hopelessness and lowerglobal self-worth predicted \ufb01rst onset of suicidal ideation over a 2-year follow-up.

IntroductionSuicide is the third leading cause of death for 10-14 year olds(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012 ) and thusconstitutes a serious problem in childhood and adolescence. In-deed, between 11.6% and 24.5% of 6th through 8th grade studentsreport having seriously thought about killing themselves at somepoint in their lives ( CDC, 2013 ). Given that rates of self-harmingthoughts and behaviors increase dramatically during the transitionfrom childhood to adolescence (e.g., Kessler et al., 2005 ), under-standing the factors that make children more likely to start con-sidering suicide might aid in early suicide risk detection andprevention.Although maternal history of depression is one of the strongestrisk factors for internalizing disorders in youth ( Goodman et al.,2011 ), few studies have examined the ways in which maternaldepression may increase risk for suicidal ideation (SI) in theirchildren. For example, there is evidence showing that children ofdepressed, compared to never depressed, mothers are more likelyto report SI by adolescence (e.g., Klimes-Dougan et al., 1999 ), a linkthat is at least partially independent of offspring psychopathology(Hammerton et al., 2015 ). However, the factors that account for theemergence of SI in these children remain unclear. In addition,despite the fact that not all children of depressed mothers ex-perience suicidal thinking, little is known about speci \ufb01c factorsthat may differentiate those who experience suicidal thoughtsfrom those who do not.One potential mechanism of risk is the development of cogni-tive vulnerabilities that put children at risk for future suicidality.To date, the majority of research in this area has focused on cog-nitive vulnerability to depression and there is evidence that chil-dren of depressed mothers exhibit higher levels of different formsof these cognitive vulnerabilities than do children of never de-pressed mothers (for a review, see Gotlib and Colich, 2014 ).However, much less is known about how these cognitive stylesmay be associated with suicidality, particularly in children. Thissaid, there is growing evidence from studies of adults suggestingthat the various cognitive vulnerabilities featured in some of theleading cognitive theories of depression, including hopelessnesstheory ( Abramson et al., 1998 ) and response styles theory ( Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991 ), may also increase risk for suicidal ideation andattempts.According to the hopelessness theory of suicide ( Abramsonet al., 1998 ), a negative inferential style, de \ufb01ned as the tendency toattribute the causes of negative events to stable and global causesand to infer negative consequences and negative self-implicationsfrom the occurrence of these events, may increase risk for suicidalthoughts and behaviors. According to the response styles theory(Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991 ), the tendency to ruminate in response toContents lists available at ScienceDirectjournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/psychresPsychiatry Researchhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2016.03.0080165-1781/ &2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Tsypes).Psychiatry Research 239 (2016) 99 \u2013104a negative mood increases risk for depression. More recent re-search has identi \ufb01ed two subtypes of rumination \u2013brooding andre\ufb02ection \u2013with evidence that brooding rumination is morestrongly related to depression and suicide-relevant outcomes (e.g.,Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008 ). Importantly, the vulnerabilitiesfeatured in these theories have been shown to predict prospectiveincreases in SI in adults (e.g., Abramson et al., 1998 ;Beevers, andMiller, 2004 ;Miranda and Nolen-Hoeksema, 2007 ;Ranieri et al.,1987 ;Smith et al., 2006 ). We should also note that hopelessness,which is prominently featured in the hopelessness theory, is awell-known risk factor for suicidal ideation, attempts, and deathsin adults (e.g., Beck et al., 1993 ).Although signi \ufb01cantly fewer studies have tested these cognitivetheories in youth, there is some evidence that the \ufb01ndings fromstudies with adults generalize to children and adolescents. Forexample, one cross-sectional study of a large community sampleof adolescents found that adolescents reporting SI, compared tothose without SI, exhibited higher levels of hopelessness and amore negative attributional style ( Labelle et al., 2013 ). Relatedly,hopelessness predicted suicide-related behaviors (i.e., suicide at-tempt or self-harm) in a sample of depressed children and ado-lescents, an effect that was at least partially independent of chil-dren \u2019s current depressive symptoms ( Hetrick et al., 2012 ). Finally, arecent prospective study found that adolescents \u2019negative in-ferential styles and rumination predicted the occurrence of SIduring a two-year follow-up ( Burke et al., 2015 ).In contrast to each of the cognitive theories described above,which were initially developed to explain depression risk in adultsand then extended to examine risk in children, Cole (1991) com-petency-based model was developed speci \ufb01cally for children andfocuses on children \u2019s self-perceived competence in various do-mains as well as more global levels of perceived self worth. Sup-porting this model, a number of cross-sectional and longitudinalstudies have documented the relations between self-perceivedcompetence in various domains and children \u2019s depressive symp-toms (e.g., Cole et al., 1996 ;Dallaire et al., 2008 ;Uhrlass et al.,2008 ). There is also preliminary evidence for the link betweenperceived social competence and SI in youth ( King et al., 2001 ).Further, a recent study found that self-esteem was a unique pre-dictor of SI in children with bipolar disorder ( Weinstein et al.,2015 ). However, it is unclear whether children \u2019s self-perceivedcompetence in social or academic domains, or their more globallevels of perceived self-worth, prospectively predicts \ufb01rst onsets ofSI.In summary, although there is strong support for the hypoth-esis that the vulnerabilities featured in leading cognitive theoriesof depression increase risk for depression and suicide-relatedoutcomes in adults, and depression in children, less is knownabout the relation between these cognitive vulnerabilities and SIin children, and no study of which we are aware has tested thepredictive validity of these vulnerabilities in children known to beat risk for depression and suicide due to a positive family history ofmajor depressive disorder (MDD). The goal of the current studywas to address this gap in the literature in two ways. First, focusingon cross-sectional analyses, we examined whether children ofdepressed mothers who reported a history of suicidal thinking atthe baseline assessment (Mom MDD/Child SI group) would exhibithigher levels of each of the cognitive vulnerabilities compared tochildren of depressed mothers without a history of suicidalthinking at baseline (Mom MDD/No Child SI) and children ofnondepressed mothers without a history of suicidal thinking atbaseline (Controls). Second, using survival analyses, we examinedwhether any of the speci \ufb01c cognitive vulnerabilities would predicttime to \ufb01rst onsets of SI in children of depressed mothers with noprior SI history.This is the \ufb01rst study to examine the cognitions thatdifferentiate children of depressed mothers with and without SI aswell as the \ufb01rst to test cognitive models regarding \ufb01rst onsets of SIin children. Importantly, we focus on a broad range of cognitivevulnerabilities proposed by the leading cognitive theories, whichallows for a more comprehensive and \ufb01ne-grained examination ofthese vulnerabilities. In addition, we sought to determine whetherany signi \ufb01cant \ufb01ndings would be maintained after statisticallycontrolling for children \u2019s levels of depressive symptoms at thebaseline assessment and for the onset of MDD during the follow-up to ensure that the effect of children \u2019s cognitions was at leastpartially independent of current mood and the occurrence ofMDD. Finally, given a strong evidence for the familial transmissionof suicidal behavior (for a review, see Brent and Melhem, 2008 ),we also sought to examine whether the signi \ufb01cant\ufb01ndings wouldbe maintained after statistically controlling for the maternal sui-cide attempt history.2. Method2.1. ParticipantsParticipants were 209 mother-child pairs recruited from thecommunity through a variety of means. To qualify for the study,mothers were required to either meet criteria for MDD during thechild \u2019s lifetime ( n\u00bc115), according to the Diagnostic and StatisticalManual of Mental Disorders \u2013Fourth Edition (DSM-IV ; AmericanPsychiatric Association, 2000), or have no lifetime diagnosis of anyDSM-IV mood disorder and no current Axis I diagnosis ( n\u00bc94). Forthe purposes of the current study, participants comprised threegroups based on maternal history of depression and children \u2019shistory of suicidal ideation: Mom MDD/Child SI ( n\u00bc37); MomMDD/No Child SI ( n\u00bc78); Controls without maternal MDD andchild SI (n \u00bc94). At baseline, the average age of the mothers was40.47 years (SD \u00bc6.87, Range\u00bc24-55; 87.6% Caucasian) and theaverage age of the children was 10.90 years ( SD\u00bc1.93, Range\u00bc8-14; 52.2% girls; 81.3% Caucasian). The median annual family in-come was $50,001 to 55,000.2.2. MeasuresThe Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders(SCID-I; First et al., 1995 ) and the Schedule for Affective Disordersand Schizophrenia for School-Age Children \u2013Present and LifetimeVersion (K-SADS-PL; Kaufman et al., 1997 ) were used to assess forcurrent and past DSM-IV Axis I disorders in mothers and theirchildren, respectively. The SCID-I and K-SADS-L were administeredat the baseline assessment and the K-SADS-L was administeredagain at each follow-up assessment, which was completed every6 months for 2 years. As part of the K-SADS-PL interviews at eachassessment, interviewers assessed for the presence of SI in chil-dren by asking the questions \u201cSometimes children who get upsetor feel bad, wish they were dead or feel they \u2019d be better off dead.Have you ever had these types of thoughts? \u201dand \u201cSometimeschildren who get upset or feel bad think about dying or evenkilling themselves. Do you have these thoughts? \u201dThe initial as-sessment focused on children \u2019s lifetime history of SI and eachfollow-up assessment focused on any thoughts that had occurredsince the previous interview. At baseline, 34 children answered\u201cyes\u201dto the \ufb01rst SI assessment question, 14 children answered\u201cyes\u201dto the second SI assessment question, and 11 children en-dorsed both of these items. A total of 27 children reported \ufb01rstonsets of SI during the study follow-up. All of these children an-swered \u201cyes\u201dto the \ufb01rst SI assessment question and 11 also an-swered \u201cyes\u201dto the second question.Cognitive vulnerabilities were examined through the use of aA. Tsypes, B.E. Gibb / Psychiatry Research 239 (2016) 99 \u2013104 100number of well-established self-report questionnaires. Children \u2019sinferential styles were assessed via the Children \u2019s AttributionalStyle Questionnaire (CASQ; Seligman et al., 1984 ) and the Chil-dren \u2019s Cognitive Style Questionnaire (CCSQ; Abela, 2001 ). The in-ternal consistency for the CASQ was 0.46, which is similar to thatobtained in previous research (e.g., Abela, 2001 ;Abela and Payne,2003 ;Cunningham, 2003 ). The internal consistencies for theCCSQ-Consequences (tendency to infer negative consequencesfollowing negative events) and CCSQ-Self (tendency to infer ne-gative self-characteristics following the occurrence of negativeevents) were 0.76 and 0.75, respectively. Children \u2019s levels of ne-gative expectancies for the future were assessed using the Hope-lessness Scale for Children (HSC; Kazdin et al., 1986 ). The internalconsistency of HSC was 0.45. Levels of rumination were assessedusing the Children \u2019s Response Style Scale (CRSS; Ziegert andKistner, 2002 ). The consistencies for the brooding and re \ufb02ectionsubscales were 0.69 and 0.68, respectively. The Self-PerceptionPro\ufb01le for Children (SPPC; Harter, 1985 ) was used to assess chil-dren \u2019s levels of self-perceived competence. The present study fo-cused on the global self-worth (SPPC-GSW), social acceptance(SPPC-SA), and scholastic competence (SPPC-SC) domains. Theinternal consistencies for these domains were 0.79, 0.77, and 0.79,respectively.Children \u2019s symptoms of depression were assessed using theChildren \u2019s Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1981 ). The internalconsistency for the CDI was 0.84. In order to avoid potential con-founding due to the fact that SI is one of CDI symptoms, CDI totalscores for all of the analyses were calculated excluding the itemthat assesses SI.Maternal suicide attempt (SA) history was assessed via theSuicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R; Osman et al.,2001 ). Speci \ufb01cally, the participants who chose the response option\u201cI attempted to kill myself, and really hoped to die \u201dwhen an-swering the \ufb01rst question of this questionnaire (i.e., \u201cHave youever thought about or attempted to kill yourself in your lifetime? \u201d)were coded as having made a previous SA. A total of 22 mothers(10.5%) endorsed a history of SA.3. ResultsDescriptive statistics for the study variables are presented inTable 1 and correlations among the variables are presented inTable 2 .F o c u s i n g \ufb01rst on baseline differences between the threegroups of children on the cognitive vulnerabilities and depressivesymptoms, we conducted a series of one-way ANOVAs with sig-ni\ufb01cant results followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. We foundsigni\ufb01cant group differences in CASQ-Generality, CRSS-Brooding,HSC, SPPC-GSW, SPPC-SC, SPPC-SA, and CDI (see Table 1 for moredetails). To examine the robustness of the differences in chil-dren \u2019s cognitive vulnerabilities, we repeated the analyses, sta-tistically controlling for the potential in \ufb02uence of children \u2019sbaseline depressive symptoms. We found that children in theMom MDD/Child SI group still exhibited signi \ufb01cantly higher le-vels of CRSS-Brooding than children in the other two groupscombined, F(1, 203) \u00bc7.07, p\u00bc0.01. In addition, children in thetwo mother MDD groups still reported signi \ufb01cantly higher scoreson CASQ-Generality, F(1, 204) \u00bc4.28, p\u00bc0.04, and HSC, F(1,200)\u00bc4.07, p\u00bc0.045, and signi \ufb01cantly lower levels of SPPC-GSW,F(1, 195) \u00bc4.52, p\u00bc0.03, and SPPC-SA, F(1, 195) \u00bc4.87, p\u00bc0.03,than children in the control group. In contrast, statistically con-trolling for the in \ufb02uence of children \u2019s depressive symptom levels,the previously signi \ufb01cant difference between children in themom MDD and child SI group and those in the control group onSPPC-SC was reduced to nonsigni \ufb01cant, F(1, 121) \u00bc0.67, p\u00bc0.41.Finally, even when we statistically controlled for maternal SAhistory, the \ufb01ndings for CRSS-Brooding were maintained, F(2,204)\u00bc12.81, po0.01. Table 3 .Next, we examined the prospective impact of children \u2019s cog-nitions on time to \ufb01rst onsets of SI during the follow-up using aseries of Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. In theseanalyses, we focused speci \ufb01cally on children of depressed motherswith no prior SI history ( n\u00bc78) because our goal was to predict\ufb01rst onset of SI among these children. We found that HSC,Wald\u00bc5.69, p\u00bc0.01, OR\u00bc1.48, and SPPC-GSW, Wald\u00bc5.28,p\u00bc0.01, OR\u00bc0.45, predicted \ufb01rst onsets of SI over the course ofthe 2-year follow-up. To visually depict these \ufb01ndings, we re-peated the analysis using upper and lower quartiles for each of thecognitive variables. The results of the analysis for HSC are pre-sented in Fig. 1 and the results for SPPC-GSW are presented inFig. 2 . Statistically controlling for the in \ufb02uence of baseline de-pressive symptoms, the effects of HSC were maintained,Wald\u00bc3.69, p\u00bc0.04, OR\u00bc1.38, though the effect of SPPC-GSW wasreduced to a nonsigni \ufb01cant trend, Wald\u00bc3.11, p\u00bc0.06, OR\u00bc0.49.In addition, because a number of children in our prospectiveanalyses also developed episodes of MDD during the follow-up(n\u00bc12), we wanted to determine whether the impact of children \u2019scognitions on their risk for SI would be maintained even aftertaking the occurrence of MDD into account. We found that theeffects of both HSC, Wald\u00bc5.13, p\u00bc0.02, OR\u00bc1.47, and SPPC-GSW,Wald\u00bc4.82, p\u00bc0.02, OR\u00bc0.47, were maintained. Therefore, thepredictive validity of the HSC for the \ufb01rst onset of SI in childrenwas at least partially independent of current depressive symptomsand risk for MDD. Similar results were obtained for SPPC-GSW,though the effect was reduced to a nonsigni \ufb01cant trend ( p\u00bc0.06)when statistically controlling for level of depressive symptoms atthe baseline assessment. Finally, the effects of both HSC,Table 1Descriptive statistics for each of the three groups.Measure Mom MDD/Child SI(n\u00bc37)Mom MDD/NoChild SI(n\u00bc78)Controls(n\u00bc94)F/\u03c72DemographicsAge at baseline 10.68 (1.93) 11.05 (2.01) 10.87 (1.87) 0.50Sex (% female) 43.2% 50.0% 57.4% 2.38Race (% Caucasian) 73.0%a73.1%a91.5%b11.60nnHouseholdIncome (median)$35\u201340,000a$40\u201345,000a$70-75,000b11.33nnMaternal Education(% graduatedcollege)30.6% 39.5% \u2013 5.79CognitionsCASQ-Generality 4.75 (2.11)a4.37 (2.39)a3.40 (1.70)b7.12nnCCSQ-Consequences 12.69 (4.37) 12.34 (5.11) 11.00 (4.79) 2.20CCSQ-SelfCharacteristics8.66 (4.01) 8.56 (4.08) 8.89 (4.20) 0.13CRSS-Brooding 31.61 (8.83)a27.04 (9.68)b26.16 (9.87)b3.85nCRSS-Re \ufb02ection 28.78 (9.46) 26.24 (11.10) 24.83 (10.51) 1.67HSC 3.97 (2.62)a3.51 (1.60)a2.83 (1.54)b5.79nnSPPC-Global Self-Worth2.99 (0.76)a3.20 (0.65)a3.53 (0.53)b11.31nnSPPC-ScholasticCompetence2.82 (0.81)a3.07 (0.70)ab3.23 (0.58)b4.65nSPPC-SocialAcceptance2.66 (0.90)a2.95 (0.69)a3.24 (0.60)b9.26nnSymptomsCDI 8.73 (6.11)a6.04 (5.24)b3.68 (3.96)c14.82nnNote .

The second goalof the study was to examine whether any of the cognitive vul-nerabilities examined would predict time to \ufb01rst onset of SI inchildren of depressed mothers with no prior history of SI. Wefound that higher levels of hopelessness and lower levels of globalself-worth signi \ufb01cantly predicted a shorter time to \ufb01rst onset of SIin these children. Importantly, these \ufb01ndings appeared to be in-dependent of maternal SA history and at least partially in-dependent of the in \ufb02uence of children \u2019s baseline levels of de-pression and the occurrence of MDD during the follow-up.It is notable that only brooding rumination differentiatedchildren of depressed mothers with and without a personal his-tory of SI at the baseline assessment. This \ufb01nding along with thefact that brooding did not predict \ufb01rst onsets of SI in our survivalanalyses suggest that brooding may re \ufb02ect a correlate or con-sequence of SI in children rather than a prospective risk factor.Future research is needed to more de \ufb01nitely determine the tem-poral relation between brooding and SI in children. In contrast,hopelessness and global self-worth differentiated children of de-pressed mothers with and without SI from controls at the baselineassessment and predicted \ufb01rst onsets of suicidal ideation over thefollow up. This is exactly what one would want to see in a true riskfactor. That is, one would want to observe similar levels of the riskfactor in children with and without prior SI and then demonstratethat this risk factor predicts \ufb01rst onset of SI among children withno prior history. These two cognitive vulnerabilities, therefore,may have promise in identifying which children of depressedmothers are at greatest risk for developing SI in the future. Inter-estingly, we also found that the same cognitive vulnerabilitiespredicted the \ufb01rst onsets of SI over the course of the 2-year follow-up in children of mothers with no history of depression (i.e.,control children). Although caution should be used in interpretingthese results due to the small number of these children, the\ufb01ndings suggest that these cognitive vulnerabilities might be im-portant to consider in all young people. Finally, with the exceptionof SPPC-Social Acceptance in the control children, other cognitivevulnerabilities including negative inferential styles for the causesof negative events, self-perceived scholastic competence and self-perceived social acceptance appear to be nonspeci \ufb01c vulner-abilities associated with maternal history of depression, withoutany speci \ufb01city to children \u2019s past or future SI.Despite strong evidence for the predictive validity of hope-lessness in this study, we should note that HSC demonstrated lowinternal consistency in our sample. There are several potentialexplanations for this. First, HSC has been shown to exhibit lowerinternal consistency when utilized with nonclinical samples,compared to clinical samples (e.g., Prinstein et al., 2008 ;Spiritoet al., 1988 ). Second, a comparison of the studies that utilized HSCin child versus adolescent samples reveals a generally lower in-ternal consistency of the scale in children (e.g., Weinstein et al.,2015 ), compared to adolescents (e.g., Prinstein et al., 2008 ). Finally,a surprisingly large number of studies that have utilized HSC havenot reported the internal consistency of the measure in theirsample (e.g., Aglan et al., 2008 ;Hetrick et al., 2012 ;Yilmaz andTurkum, 2008 ). It will be important for future research, therefore,to (i) report the internal consistency of the scale in their sample,which will allow a better understanding of the types of samplesand conditions that lead to higher versus lower internal con-sistency of the scale and (ii) consider the development of alternatemeasures of hopelessness in children that would have strongerinternal consistency. Finally, we should note that hopelessness is afairly abstract construct and it may simply be that it is not wellenough developed in children to exhibit strong internal con-sistency despite the fact that it displays strong predictive validity.The present study had a number of strengths, including themulti-wave prospective design, the focus on a high-risk sample,and the use of structured interviews with multiple informants (i.e.,parent and child reports) to assess the presence of SI in children.Importantly, the current study is the \ufb01rst to our knowledge tocomprehensively examine the cognitions that differentiate chil-dren of depressed mothers with and without SI as well as to testsome of the leading cognitive models with regard to \ufb01rst onsets ofSI in these children. This said, the study also exhibited some lim-itations that might provide directions for future studies. First, onlythe presence or absence of SI in children was assessed. Futureresearch should examine how speci \ufb01c cognitive vulnerabilitiesrelate to characteristics of SI, including its content, frequency,duration, severity, and controllability. Second, the cross-sectionalanalyses focused on children \u2019s lifetime history of SI whereas theassessment of cognitive vulnerabilities focused on the current le-vels of each variable. Therefore, it is possible that stronger rela-tions would have been observed for other cognitive vulnerabilitiesif we had been able to focus on concurrent levels of SI (e.g., spe-ci\ufb01cally recruiting children with and without current SI). Third,due to the demographics of the recruitment area, our sample wasracially/ethnically homogenous, which might limit the general-izability of our \ufb01ndings to other populations and geographic areas.Fourth, due to the low internal consistency of HSC in our sample,additional studies are needed in order to replicate our \ufb01ndingswith regard. We should also note that the reliability of the CASQwas also low, which, although consistent with other research (e.g.,Abela, 2001 ;Abela and Payne, 2003 ;Cunningham, 2003 ), mayhave reduced our power to detect signi \ufb01cant effects with thismeasure. Fourth, we speci \ufb01cally chose to focus on cognitive vul-nerabilities featured in each of the leading cognitive theories,which increased the overall number of analyses and could haveincreased our risk of Type 1 error. Future studies, therefore, arenecessary to replicate the current \ufb01ndings before any \ufb01rm con-clusions can be drawn. Finally, the relatively small sample sizeavailable for the prospective analyses limited the statistical powerof our exploratory moderation analyses; future studies, therefore,are needed to determine whether the predictive validity of thecognitive vulnerabilities may differ based on child age and/or sex.In summary, the present study makes several important con-tributions to the literature. Speci \ufb01cally, whereas extant researchon cognitive vulnerabilities has focused primarily on risk for de-pression and suicidality in adults and depression in children, thecurrent study focused on a broad range of cognitive vulnerabilitiesproposed by a number of leading cognitive theories of depressionand their relation to both the lifetime history and the emergenceof SI in children. Our \ufb01ndings extend the literature by suggestingthat children of depressed mothers who have thought about sui-cide exhibit higher levels of brooding rumination than children ofdepressed or nondepressed mothers who have never thoughtabout suicide. Importantly, hopelessness and global self-worthmight constitute speci \ufb01c forms of cognitive vulnerability thatprospectively predict \ufb01rst onset of SI in children at-risk by virtueof maternal depression history. These \ufb01ndings might have im-portant implications for early suicide prevention in these children,suggesting that targeting their levels of brooding, hopelessness,and perception of self-worth might attenuate children \u2019s risk forsuicidality. More speci \ufb01cally, although originally developed foradults, children at risk for SI might also bene \ufb01t from the inter-ventions that target self-esteem, such as Child- and Family-Fo-cused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( West et al., 2014 ) andbrooding rumination, such as Rumination-Focused Cognitive Be-havioral Therapy ( Watkins et al., 2011 ) and Mindfulness-BasedA. Tsypes, B.E. Gibb / Psychiatry Research 239 (2016) 99 \u2013104 103Cognitive Therapy ( Segal et al., 2012 ). Importantly, treatments thattarget maternal depression might also improve the functioning oftheir children across multiple domains, including perceived aca-demic and behavioral competence and depressive symptoms (e.g.,Garber et al., 2011 ), which might decrease the levels of brooding,hopelessness, and perception of self-worth in these children.AcknowledgmentsThe project was supported by National Institute of Child Healthand Human Development grant HD057066 and National Instituteof Mental Health grant MH098060 awarded to the second authorand National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowshipunder Grant no. 1120674 awarded to the \ufb01rst author.
