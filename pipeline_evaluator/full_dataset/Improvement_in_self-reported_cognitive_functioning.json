These are risk factors for more a severe course of illness, and despite the\nconsiderable relapse risk of MDD, few interventions target the remitted phase, a\nhigh-risk period for developing new episodes. Online distribution of interventions\ncould help close this gap. Computerized working memory training (CWMT)\nshows promising results, but findings are inconclusive regarding which symptoms\nimprove following this intervention, and its long-term effects. This study reports\nresults from a longitudinal open-label two-year follow-up pilot-study of self-\nreported cognitive residual symptoms following 25 sessions (40min), five times a\nweek of a digitally delivered CWMT intervention. Ten of 29 patients remitted from\nMDD completed two-year follow-up assessment. Significant large improvements\nin self-reported cognitive functioning on the behavior rating inventory of executive\nfunction-adult version appeared after two-years (d=0.98), but no significant\nimprovements were found in rumination (d<0.308) measured by the ruminative\nresponses scale. The former showed moderate non-significant associations to\nimprovement in CWMT both post-intervention (r= 0.575) and at two-year follow-\nup (r= 0.308). Strengths in the study included a comprehensive intervention and\nlong follow-up time. Limitations were small sample and no control group. No\nsignificant differences between completers and drop-outs were found, however,\nattrition effects cannot be ruled out and demand characteristics could influence\nfindings. Results suggested lasting improvements in self-reported cognitive\nfunctioning following online CWMT. Controlled studies with larger samples\nshould replicate these promising preliminary findings.\n\nKEYWORDS\n\nremission, digital interventions, longitudinal study, relapse prevention intervention,\ncomputerized working memory training, self reported cognitive deficits\n\n01 frontiersin.org\n\n\nRonold etal\n\nIntroduction\n\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading burden of disease\nglobally. This trend has been enhanced by the COVID-19 pandemic\n(1), and the burden is in large part due to the high rates of relapse\nseen in MDD (2). New episodes are linked with persisting residual\nsymptoms following affective remission including subthreshold\ndepressive symptoms, fatigue, sleep problems, rumination, and\ncognitive deficits (3), contributing to relapse or recurrence and a\nmore severe courses of illness (4). A large meta-analysis found small\nto large effects sizes for cognitive deficits in remitted MDD\npopulations, measured objectively by neuropsychological tests,\nacross most domains of cognitive functioning, excluding auditory\nattention, general cognitive ability, autobiographical memory, in\naddition to inhibition unconstrained by speed (5). In addition, self-\nreported subjective cognitive difficulties (subjective deficits) are\nprevalent in acute states of MDD (6); and as residual cognitive\nsymptoms following MDD (7, 8). Subjective deficits are of clinical\nrelevance and are associated with lower quality of life and poorer\nfunctioning following MDD (9), and could contribute to the\nalarming rate of relapse seen in MDD (10, 11). Perhaps surprisingly,\nsubjective deficits show small associations to cognitive deficits\nmeasured by objective experimental and clinical neuropsychological\ntests (5, 12) A meta-analysis investigating the correlation between\nsubjective and objective measures of cognition found small\nsignificant associations between some measures, with most\nconsistent effects between questionnaires measuring shifting and\ntests measuring shifting (13). Some studies suggest that subjective\ncognition show associations to symptoms of MDD rather than to\nneuropsychological tests (14, 15). In the research literature objective\ncognitive tests performed in a controlled environment is\nrecommended as a measure of cognitive deficits in depression (16).\nSelf-reported cognition could be considered complementary to the\nperformance on objective cognitive tests and measure different\naspects of ecologically important (dys)function (12, 17-19).\nImportantly, cognitive deficits are not fully remediated by\ntraditional treatments (20, 21), and a few interventions target\nresidual cognitive difficulties in the remitted phase of MDD,\nincluding medication, brain stimulation and cognitive remediation\n(22). Little is known, however, about the long-term effects of\ninterventions targeting cognition following MDD, as was evident\nby a recent meta-analysis (23). There is also a lack of research\nreporting long-term outcomes in subjective cognitive deficits, with\na few exceptions (24-28). Overall, the results from these studies\nreporting short- and long-term outcomes have been mixed Thus,\nexploring how new interventions influence subjective deficits over\ntime is of importance.\n\nAnother important residual cognitive symptom following\nMDD is rumination. Rumination is an emotion regulation strategy\nwere one passively brood over self-related negative experiences\nand is hypothesized to be related to deficits in working memory\n(WM) for negative material, sometimes termed hot-cognition (26,\n29-31). Associations between objective cognitive tests and\nrumination are small, but significant associations have been\nestablished for WM (3), and subjective cognition (24). Rumination\nis a central risk factor following remission of mood symptoms\n(32), and predict relapse in remitted populations (4, 33, 34). Thus,\ndeficits in cognition are suspected to be related to rumination,\n\nFrontiers in Psychiatry\n\n10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1163073\n\nhowever, relationships to subjective deficits are unclear (24), and\na recent review suggested that subjective deficits could cause\nrumination about not living up to one\u2019s premorbid level, and thus\nincrease relapse risk following MDD (19). Interventions\nimproving cognition could thus reduce subjective deficits and\nrumination following MDD. Interventions like computerized\nworking memory training (CWMT), could result in improvement\nof residual cognitive symptoms following depression (10, 23).\nCWMT has been shown to improve objective cognitive functions\nlike executive functions and associations between rumination and\nWM for negative material (23, 35). Results are mixed regarding\nwhether interventions like CWMT improves rumination however,\nwith studies finding support for improvements in some residual\nsymptoms like objective cognitive deficits, but not all, symptoms\nlike subjective cognitive deficits, depressive symptoms, and some\naspects of rumination (19, 36, 37). Even less is known about\nsubjective deficits (19, 25, 26), and the lasting effects of\ninterventions, with preliminary reports suggesting long term\nimprovements in rumination and depressive symptoms, but not\nsubjective deficits (25). Given the high relapse rate and\nincremental relapse risk in MDD, knowledge about the lasting\neffects of interventions targeting residual cognitive symptoms\nis vital.\n\nSupplying and accessing interventions targeting residual\nsymptoms in remission from MDD can be challenging, as there are\nlimited resources such as trained therapists in health care systems to\ndeliver targeted treatment, particularly in remission (4). One\npromising approach is to deliver pro-cognitive interventions digitally\nas this could increase access, agency; and reduce costs (38). A strength\nwithin the research field is that many pro-cognitive interventions are\nalready delivered online or are computerized (23). However, digital\ndelivery might have implications for motivation and engagement (39).\nIt has therefore been suggested that that sufficient guidance by\ntherapists can increase motivation and engagement (40). In sum,\ngiven limited studies in this area, there is a need to further investigate\nthe long-term effects of on cost effective interventions on clinically\nrelevant residual cognitive symptom like subjective deficits\nand rumination.\n\nThe current study investigated the long-term effects of a\ncomprehensive digitally delivered CWMT intervention. If CWMT\nimproves working memory (WM) control for negative material in\nhot-cognition, associated with rumination (35, 41), rumination would\ndecline over time following CWMT. Ronold et al. (35) investigated\nCWMT effects on hot- and cold cognition, rumination, and depressive\nsymptoms and found significantly improved effects on the two former,\nbut not the latter. However, WM improvements could generalize to\ndaily function, e.g, self-perceived cognitive function over time, and a\nstudy found associations between subjective deficits and later quality\nof life and psychosocial function (9), suggesting that long term\ndevelopment is important to investigate. Also improvements over time\ncould reduce ruminative tendencies. It was thus hypothesized that\nCWMT would yield durable effects in self-reported cognitive function\nand rumination. The following research questions were investigated:\n\n-How does self-reported cognitive function (subjective deficits) and\nrumination develop two-year following CWMT?\n\n-Is CWMT improvement related to improvement in subjective\ndeficits or rumination?\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\nRonold etal\n\nMethods\nParticipants and procedure\n\n\u2018This study is based on two-year data from an open pilot study\ninvestigating the effects of CWMT. Participants in the study were\nassessed pre, post, one- and two-years after CWMT.\n\nRecruitment, participant flow\n\nTwenty-nine remitted participants assessed by the Montgomery\nAsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (42) a score of <12, were\nincluded in the study initially [for more details see (35)]. Participants\nremained remitted at one and two-year follow up (MADRS score <12).\nOne participant was missing from the completers group at 1year\nfollow-up. See Table 1 for demographical characteristics.\n\nCWMT intervention\n\nA commercial CWMT program, Cogmed\u2122 was used for cognitive\ntraining The program consisted of several number- letter-, and spatial\nspan tasks with personalized, incremental difficulty. Participants worked\napproximately 40min on different tasks each training day. The\ninterventions were delivered digitally, online, were participants logged on\nthrough computer or laptop, lasted approximately Sweeks, with roughly\nfive days of training cach week, and had weekly therapist guidance over\ntelephone discussing progress and potential obstacles with the training,\n\nTABLE 1 Participant demographics, attrition and training outcomes.\n\nGroups\n(males)\n\nCompleters\nn=10 (4)\n\nDrop ol Drop from\n2years intervention\n2) n=10 (4)\n\nM (SD) M (SD)\n\nM (SD)\n\nAge 36.5 (10.381) 383 (14.016) 33.56 (7.732)\nEducation 16 2.11) 17.1 (145) 15.44 (174)\nBRIEF pre 1207 (25.18) 1156 (20.18) 124.67 (25.23)\nBRIEF post 1105 (24.73) 116.44 (16.57) un\ntraining*\n\nBRIEF 1 year* 100.44 (18.44) | 96(23.895) n=3 Ee\n\nn=9\nBRIEF 2years 97.9 (19.04) we fied\n\nRRS pre 187 (14.637) 4789 (13743) | 47.778 (14.636)\nRRS post 147 (18.499) 45 (10013) se\ntraining*\nRRS 1year\u00ae 391232) 4433(13.65) me\n\nn=3\nRRS 2years* 413 (14.937) en po\n% Improvement 533 (14.9) 487 (17.78) wae\n\ncwMT\n\nCompleters finished the intervention and came back for follow up assessments.

Participants were compensated through free\naccess to the Cogmed\u2122 platform and received a gift card\n(approximately 408) at two-year follow up.\n\nOutcome-measures\n\nSubjective cognitive function\n\nParticipants completed an inventory of self-report measure of\ncognitive difficulties in executive functions (behavior rating inventory\nof executive function-adult version; BRIEF-A) of which the 75 items\nglobal executive composite (GEC) was used to measure subjectively\nexperienced cognitive difficulties. Raw scores were used to investigate\nchanges, and high scores indicated poorer rating.\n\nRumination\n\nParticipants completed a 22-item self-report assessment of\nrumination, the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) to assess tendency\nfor rumination in response to sad mood.\n\nStatistical analyses and improvement\nscores\n\n\u2018All analyses were run in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences\n(SPSS; version 28). Attrition was investigated through one way\nANOVA. Repeated measures ANOVA investigated changes in subjective\ncognitive function and rumination from pre- to post intervention, 1 and\ntwo-year follow up. Paired sampled t-tests was used as follow up tests.\nPercent improvement in CWMT was calculated by the formula highest\nscore\u2014starting score/starting score * 100. Improvement scores were\ncalculated by subtracting pre scores from post (immediately after the\nintervention)- and two-year follow up scores, so positive values\nrepresented improved scores, and bivariate correlations between CWMT\nand residual symptom improvement was calculated (Pearsons 7). Effect\nsizes was described as small, medium, and large according to Cohen (43).\nBecause of the small sample spaghetti plots showing the individual\ntrajectories in BRIEF (see Figure 1) and RRS (see Figure 2) were used to\nillustrate development of subjectively reported cognitive function\nand rumination.\n\nResults\n\u2018There were no significant differences between completers and drop-\n\nouts on any of the clinical or demographic variables with small effects (see\n\u2018Table 1), suggesting limited attrition effects.

BRIEF, behavior rating inventory of executive function (global executive\ncomposite change scores). RRS, ruminative responses scale change scores.\n\nAlthough the results must be considered preliminary and uncertain\ndue to the small sample size and lack of control group, findings\nsupport the use of digitally delivered CWMT to improve subjective\ndeficits. In fact, the improvements in subjective cognition were even\nlarger compared to preliminary findings from long term follow up of\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\nRonold etal\n\nin-person interventions cognitive training interventions (25). This\ncould support better acceptability and feasibility of online tasks\ncompared to other interventions (10, 26), especially for long term\noutcomes for subjective cognition.\n\nRumination did not improve; thus, interventions targeting emotional\ninformation processing and hot cognition might be more optimal. Hot\ncognition involves cognitive control for emotional material (29), and\ncould be more related to depressive symptoms than classical tasks of\ncognitive and executive functions (44). Alternatively, the small sample was\nunderpowered to detect changes in rumination. Hammar et al. (10), for\ninstance, reported that a subgroup improving from CWMT showed\ndecreased rumination. Several studies have suggested that subgroups with\ndifferent cognitive profiles could exist in MDD (45, 46), and finding\n\u2018moderators for personalization and optimalization of cognitive training\neffects are important for future research (47). There are theoretical and\nempirical connections between WM and rumination (31), with several\nauthors targeting this modality by cognitive training with various success\n(36). Thus, personalizing interventions and examine subgroups to identify\nthose who show- and do not show benefits could be important (47).\nAlternatively, or in addition, rumination might show more connections\nto hot-cognition than cold-cognition (29, 35, 41, 44), and targeting \u201chot\ncognition\u201d could be more effective in reducing rumination and affective\nresidual symptoms of depression (48). Thus, future studies should\ninvestigate the ability of digitally delivered interventions to target more\nbroadly, including hot cognition and rumination, and investigate the\nmechanisms of cognitive training on emotion regulation (37). The weekly\ntherapist contact might have influenced results. However, since\nimprovements increased even 1year after the intervention, this could\nprobably not fully explain results. The moderate association between\nimprovement in self-reported subjective cognitive difficulties and the\ntraining paradigm could suggest specific effects of WM training on self-\nreported cognitive functions in daily life and might thus represent an\nexample of far transfer effects, or at least near transfer across domains.\nFindings could be relevant to relapse prevention because of this, however\nmore methodological rigorous controlled studies should investigate\nthis further.\n\nStrengths, limitations, and suggestions for\nfuture research\n\n\u2018This is the first study to report on the effects of digitally delivered\ncognitive enhancement interventions after two-years on residual cognitive\nsymptoms. However, sample sizes were small-, dropout considerable, but\ncomparable to other studies in the literature (23, 25). There were no\ndifferences on demographic or outcome variables between those\ncompleting the intervention and dropping out at pre intervention,\nhowever, attrition effects cannot be ruled out, and some participants\nmight have relapsed during training and follow up. The study was\nunderpowered to detect small changes. Thus, acceptability could be a\nchallenge in the current study. Previous studies, however, suggested that\nthe current CWMT paradigm is both acceptable and feasible to use (10,\n49). No objective neuropsychological assessments of cognitive functions\nwere reported, limiting generalizability to cognitive deficits on behavioral\ntasks. However, subjectively experienced cognitive difficulties could be of\nclinical relevance in the remitted phase, as it could be associated with risk\nof depression relapse and poorer outcomes following MDD (19). Another\nlimitation concerning outcome measures is not including a functional\ntransfer measure of cognitive effects, which is recommended to investigate\n\nFrontiers in Psychiatry\n\n10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1163073\n\ncognitive interventions generalizability (50). Sample- and demand\ncharacteristics could partly explain results, and future studies should\ninvestigate factors related to drop out, include more participants, and\nimplement designs controlling for these variables. In addition, the\nincreasing improvements in subjective cognition over time suggested that\nit might take time for effects to generalize, and thus longitudinal studies\nof cognitive remediation with longer follow up time might be feasible.\nHowever, due to the high drop-out, longitudinal studies with digital\nfollow up assessment might be more optimal for acceptability following\nCWMT interventions, and future longitudinal studies should plan\nfor this.\n\nConclusion\n\nA group completing digitally delivered CWMT showed reduced\nlevels of subjective cognitive deficits two-years following\nimplementation. This shows significant promise in effective and\navailable relapse prevention strategies. Thus, the digitally delivered\nworking memory training shows promise in reducing subjective\ndifficulties following MDD, and long-term effects of digitally delivered\ninterventions could be comparable or supersede those seen in the\nlimited research on interventions delivered in the clinic. However,\ngiven the methodological qualities of the current study, more\ncontrolled replication of results should be done. There were no\nsignificant improvements in rumination, underscoring the importance\nof continuing to develop interventions targeting important residual\nsymptoms like hot cognitive processes for optimal relapse prevention.\n\nData availability statement\n\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will\nbe made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\n\nEthics statement\n\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and\napproved by The committee for ethical research in Western Norway\n(2014/1079).
