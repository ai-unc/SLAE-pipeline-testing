Thus, there is a crucial need to identify processes that contribute to the maintenance of\nDepression depressive episodes. Difficulty removing negative information from working memory (WM) is posited to ex-\nRumination\n\nacerbate affective, cognitive, and biological dysregulation in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), but this has not\nyet been tested empirically.\n\nMethods: In this study we examined whether training depressed individuals to remove negative information\nfrom WM (RNI training) would reduce symptoms of depression and levels of rumination, and would be asso-\nciated with attenuated biological responsivity to stress. Individuals diagnosed with MDD were randomly as-\nsigned to complete Real-RNI training or Sham-RNI training for six days.\n\nResults: Across conditions, participants exhibited significant improvements from pre- to post-training in re-\nmoving negative information from WM, symptoms of depression, and rumination. Furthermore, participants in\nthe Real-RNI condition showed a more attenuated pattern of cortisol and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)\nresponses to stress than did participants in the Sham-RNI training condition.\n\nLimitations: We did not assess the long-term effects of training. It will be important for future research to ex-\namine whether the documented training-related effects persist across time.\n\nConclusions: This study is the first to examine the effects of RNI training on clinical symptoms and biological\nresponses to stress in MDD, and it provides experimental evidence that training individuals with depression to\nremove negative information from WM can help to modulate the heightened biological responses to stress seen\nin depression.\n\nBiological stress response\n\n1. Introduction\n\nMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by difficulty re-\nmoving negative information from working memory (WM; LeMoult and\nGotlib, 2019; World Health Organization, 2012). Although researchers\nhave posited that difficulty removing negative information from WM\ncontributes to depressive symptoms, rumination, and exaggerated bio-\nlogical responses to stress (Joormann, 2010; LeMoult and Gotlib, 2019;\nNolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008), there has been no research to date that\nexperimentally examines the associations among these variables in the\ncontext of depression. Consequently, we do not fully understand the\nways in which difficulty removing negative information from WM\ncontributes to MDD.\n\n+ Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: ellen jopling@psych.ubc.ca (E. Jopling).\n* Equal contribution.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.01.007\n\nTo date, only one study has experimentally examined the effects of\ndifficulty removing information from WM on symptoms of depression\nand levels of rumination (Onraedt and Koster, 2014). In that study,\nparticipants with MDD and high levels of trait rumination completed six\nsessions of training on a dual n-back task. Although performance on the\ndual n-back task significantly improved from pre- to post-training, this\ngain did not transfer to measures of depression, rumination, or alter-\nnative measures of WM. It is possible that Onraedt and Koster (2014)\ndid not find transfer effects because participants were trained to remove\nnon-valenced information from WM, which does not directly target the\ncore difficulty underlying levels of rumination and depressive symp-\ntoms observed in MDD: difficulty removing negatively valenced in-\nformation from WM (for reviews see Joormann and Stanton, 2016;\n\nReceived 25 October 2019; Received in revised form 1 January 2020; Accepted 3 January 2020\n\nAvailable online 07 January 2020\n0165-0327/ © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n\n\nE Jopling, et al.\n\nLeMoult and Gotlib, 2019). While there is some evidence that affective\nWM training can result in improved control over affective information\nin non-clinical samples (Schweizer et al., 2011, 2013), the associations\namong removing negative information from WM, rumination, and de-\npression have not been examined experimentally, and not within a\nsample of participants with MDD.\n\nAlthough researchers have also not yet examined the association\nbetween difficulties in WM disengagement and dysregulated biological\nresponses to stress, studies assessing constructs related to WM disen-\ngagement provide a degree of support for this association. For example,\nresearchers have documented that ruminative responses to stress are\nassociated with impaired recovery of both the neuroendocrine and\nautonomic nervous systems (Key et al, 2008), particularly for in-\ndividuals with MDD (LeMoult and Joormann, 2014). For example, both\nMDD and ruminative responses to stress have been linked with ex-\ncessive respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) withdrawal in response to\nstress (Beauchaine, 2015; LeMoult et al., 2015). Given the association\nbetween difficulty disengaging from negative material in WM and ru-\nmination (LeMoult and Gotlib, 2019), there is reason to expect that\ndifficulty disengaging from negative information in WM might underlie\nthe dysregulated biological responses to stress documented in MDD.\nHowever, this possibility has not yet been experimentally examined.\n\nThe cognitive bias modification (CBM) literature highlights the\nimportance of manipulating cognitive processes to test causal relations\nand to identify mechanisms that might underlie the onset of MDD\n(Hallion and Ruscio, 2011). Investigators have contended that the\nstrongest advances in our understanding of how CBM paradigms\nachieve their effects will come from the assessment of training-related\nchanges across multiple domains. Underscoring this point, previous\nstudies using CBM paradigms have demonstrated that training\ndividuals to alter the way they process information can result in\nchanges in cognition, affect, and biology. These studies help to establish\ncausal associations between cognitive biases and both affective and\nbiological functioning (Hertel and Mathews, 2011). To date, much of\nthe CBM literature has targeted attentional and interpretation biases in\nthe context of anxiety disorders (Hallion and Ruscio, 2011;\nMacleod and Mathews, 2012). Thus, studies are needed that investigate\nthe cognitive, affective, and biological effects of training participants\n‘with MDD to remove negative information from WM.\n\nThe present study was designed to extend the CBM literature by\ntesting the effects of training depressed individuals to remove negative\ninformation (RNI training) from WM on cognitive, affective, and bio-\nlogical functioning. We assigned individuals diagnosed with MDD to\neither the Real-RNI or Sham RNI condition for six days. We measured\nindividual differences in the ability to remove negative information\nfrom WM, symptoms of depression, and levels of rumination at both\npre- and post-training sessions. In addition, at post-training, partici-\npants completed a standardized laboratory-based stressor, during which\nwe measured biological responsivity. We predicted that, compared to\nparticipants in the Sham-RNI condition, participants in the Real-RNI\ncondition would exhibit greater improvements from pre- to post-\ntraining in removing negative information from WM (Hypothesis 1).\nFurther, we expected that, compared to participants assigned to the\nSham-RNI condition, participants assigned to the Real-RNI condition\nwould report greater pre- to post-training decreases in symptoms of\ndepression (Hypothesis 2) and levels of rumination (Hypothesis 3), and\nwould exhibit attenuated biological responses across the laboratory\nstressor as measured by cortisol (Hypothesis 4) and RSA (Hypothesis 5).\n\n2. Method\n2.1. Participants\nAdults between 18 and 60 years of age were eligible to participate in\n\nthis study if they were fluent in English and met criteria for current\nMDD or had no past or current psychopathology (CTLs). We recruited\n\na6\n\nJournal of Affective Disorders 265 (2020) 45-51\n\nCIL participants in order to confirm that our sample of depressed\nparticipants had, at pre-training, significantly higher self-reported\nsymptoms of depression and rumination, and significantly greater dif-\nficulty removing negative information from WM. Diagnostic status was\ndetermined using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-\nIV; First et al., 1996). Participants were excluded if they had major\nmedical conditions, head trauma, bipolar disorder, symptoms of psy-\nchosis, an alcohol or substance use disorder in the past 6 months, or\nconditions know to affect the neuroendocrine or autonomic nervous\nsystems.\n\nOf the 90 individuals (54 with MDD and 36 CTLs) who were eligible\nfollowing the SCID-IV, seven participants with MDD did not complete\nthe post-training session and five participants with MDD had substantial\ndifficulties following directions (e.g., did not properly complete the\nbaseline assessment or did not complete any at-home trainings). Thus,\nthe final sample consisted of 78 participants (42 with MDD and 36\nCILs) who were between 19 and 55 years of age. The final sample of\nparticipants did not differ at pre-training from the 12 individuals\nwithout complete data on any clinical or demographic characteristics,\nall ps > 0.05.\n\n2.2. Working memory bias task\n\nDifficulty eliminating positive and negative information from WM\nwas assessed using the affective version of the Sternberg task\n(Joormann and Gotlib, 2008). The task consists of three blocks of 40\ntrials. Each trial consisted of a learning display, a cue display, and a\nprobe-recognition display. During the learning display, participants\nviewed two sets of three words. Following the offset of the word sets,\nparticipants viewed a cue that indicated which set of words would be\nrelevant for the probe-recognition display; this prompted participants\nto remove the other (irrelevant) set of words from WM. Of the 120\ntrials, 40% required that participants remove the positive word set and\n40% required that participants remove the negative word set. The final\n20% of trials were control trials, which included positive and negative\n‘words in both sets; these trials were included to ensure that participants\ndid not learn to make decisions about the probe based on word valence.\nFinally, in the probe-recognition display, a single word was presented\nand participants were given 3000 ms to indicate as quickly and as ac-\ncurately as possible whether the probe word was from the relevant\nword set. The probe word could be from the relevant set, the irrelevant\nset, or a novel word that was not included in either set. Consistent with\nprevious research (Joormann and Gotlib, 2008), individual differences\nin the ability to remove irrelevant information from WM were modeled\nas decision latencies to words from the irrelevant set minus the decision\nlatencies to new words of the same valence. These differences in re-\nsponse times are termed intrusion effects and were calculated separately\nfor positive and negative words. Difficulty removing information from\nWM results in larger intrusion effects. Psychometric properties for the\nSternberg were good: split-half reliability coefficients on critical trial\nRTs ranged from 0.78 to 0.96.\n\n2.3. Working memory training\n\nUsing stratified random assignment based on their scores on the\nBeck Depression Inventory-II, participants with MDD were assigned to\neither the Real-RNI (n = 22) or the Sham-RNI (n = 20) condition. In\nboth conditions, participants completed an at-home training session\neach day for six days. Training tasks were administered using E-Prime\nsoftware version 2 on laptop computers provided to participants. Each\ntraining session lasted 15-20 min and performance files were stored on\nthe computer until participants returned the laptop at their post-\ntraining session. Consistent with previous research, analyses were re-\nstricted to trials in which participants made correct responses and in\nwhich reaction times (RTs) were less than 3000 ms (Joormann and\nGotlib, 2008). This resulted in the loss of 9.21% of trials at pre-training\n\n\nE Jopling, et al.\n\nand 7.86% of trials at post-training, which is consistent with previous\nstudies (LeMoult, Yoon, and Joormann, 2015; LeMoult, and Joormann,\n2014). Participants in the two conditions did not differ from each other\nin the percentage of trials lost at pre-training or post-training, ps >\n0.201.\n\n2.3.1. Real RNI\n\nParticipants in the Real-RNI condition were presented with an\nadapted version of the original affective Sternberg Task that was\ncompleted during the pre-training session. The original and training\ntasks differed in length and in percentage of each type of trial. Of the 60\ntrials completed during each training session, 80% of trials required\nthat participants remove the negative word set, 10% required that\nparticipants remove the positive word set (to ensure that participants\nhad reason to continue learning both positive and negative word sets),\nand 10% were control trials.\n\n2.3.2. Sham RNI\n\nParticipants in the Sham-RNI condition were presented with a\nmodified lexical decision task. In each trial, participants were presented\nwith a string of letters and were required to indicate whether the string\nformed a real word. Of the 360 trials, 50% of trials presented nonsense\nwords, and 50% presented the same words that were used in the Real-\nRNI task. Thus, participants in the Real-RNI and Sham-RNI conditions\nwere exposed to the same wordlists each day (additional details in the\nonline supplement).\n\n2.4. Psychosocial stressor\n\nTo examine participants’ biological responses to stress, participants\ncompleted the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum et al., 1993)\nduring the post-training lab session. The TSST is a standardized stressor\nthat has been found to be effective in eliciting a biological stress re-\nsponse (Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004). It consists of four phases:\nbaseline (20 min), anticipation (10 min), stressor (10 min), and re-\ncovery (30 min). Neuroendocrine (salivary cortisol) and autonomic\n(RSA) responses were measured throughout the task. See online sup-\nplement for further details.\n\n2.4.1. Cortisol\n\nSaliva samples were collected immediately before the baseline\nperiod (S1), immediately after the baseline period (S2), immediately\nafter the stressor ($3), 15 min after stressor offset (54), and 30 min after\nstressor offset (5). This collection schedule is based on meta-analytic\nfindings of the timing of cortisol reactivity and recovery (Dickerson and\nKemeny, 2004). Cortisol values were winsorized to 2 standard devia-\ntions above the mean as is consistent with previous research\n(Doom et al., 2013; Gotlib et al., 2015).\n\n2.4.2. RSA\nAutonomic data were recorded continuously using the Biopac\nsystem. ECG signals were transmitted using three electrodes positioned\nin a modified lead II configuration. Respiration was measured using a\nrespiratory belt placed around the chest and the abdomen. RSA was\nscored in 1-minute epochs using AcqKnowledge 4.0 software, and was\ncalculated as the natural log of the high frequency power\n(0.15-0.40 Hz). Consistent with Kircanski et al. (2016), we created the\nfollowing segments: baseline (10 min), anticipation (5 min), speech task\n(5 min), arithmetic task (5 min), initial recovery (15 min), and final\nrecovery (15 min).\n\n3. Self-report measures\n3.1. Symptoms of depression\n\nThe severity of participants’ symptoms of depression was assessed\n\na7\n\nJournal of Affective Disorders 265 (2020) 45-51\n\nwith the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-L; Beck et al., 1996), a 21-\nitem self-report questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms experi-\nenced in the previous two weeks. In addition, at the pre- and post\ntraining sessions, participants completed a modified BDLII scale (M-\nBDLII) that assessed depressive symptoms in the previous three days. In\nthe present study, there was excellent internal consistency in both the\noriginal and modified versions of the BDLII (as = 0.92).\n\n3.1.1. Rumination\n\nRumination was assessed with the Ruminative Responses Scale\n(Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow, 1991), a 22-item self-report ques-\ntionnaire designed to measure individual differences in the tendency to\nruminate when feeling depressed. In addition, at the pre- and post\ntraining session, participants completed a modified RRS (M-RRS) that\nassessed rumination in the previous three days. In the current study,\nthere was excellent internal consistency in both the original and mod-\nified versions of the RRS (as = 0.93).\n\n3.2. Procedure\n\nThe study was approved by the Stanford University Institutional\nReview Board. Following previous CBM studies (Hallion and\nRuscio, 2011; Koster and Hoorelbeke, 2015), data were collected in a\nmulti-session procedure. Participants first came into the lab to complete\nthe SCID and self-report measures of symptoms of depression (BDI-II)\nand rumination (RRS). Eligible participants were invited to return to\nthe lab within two weeks for the pre-training session, during which they\ncompleted the Sternberg Task and reported on their symptoms of de-\npression (M-BDI-IT) and rumination (M-RRS) within the past three days.\nParticipants were then assigned to complete either Real-RNI or Sham-\nRNI training at home for the next six consecutive days. On the seventh\nday, participants returned to the lab for the post-training session,\nduring which participants completed the same cognitive and self-report\nmeasures completed during the pre-training session, and the TSST.\n\n3.3. Statistical analyses\n\nTo examine whether depressed individuals who were assigned to\nthe Real-RNI condition exhibited greater improvements from pre- to\npost-training than did depressed individuals who were assigned to the\nSham-RNI condition in removing negative information from WM\n(Hypothesis 1), we will conduct a three-way Condition (Real RNI, Sham\nRNID by Valence (positive, negative) by Time (pre-training, post-\ntraining) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on intrusion\neffects. If the expected three-way interaction is significant, we will\nconduct follow-up two-way ANOVAs within each condition, for each\nvalence, and at each time point, followed by paired or independent\nsample t-tests as indicated. To examine whether depressed individuals\nassigned to the Real-RNI condition exhibit greater improvements from\npre- to post-training than depressed individuals assigned to the Sham-\nRNI condition in symptoms of depression (Hypothesis 2) and levels of\nrumination (Hypothesis 3), we will conduct a two-way Condition by\nTime repeated-measures ANOVAs on BDI-II and on RRS scores. If the\nexpected two-way interaction is significant, we will conduct in-\ndependent-samples t-tests at pre- and post-training, and paired-samples\ntests for participants in both the Real-RNI and Sham-RNI condition.\nTo examine whether depressed individuals assigned to the Real-RNI\ncondition exhibited attenuated cortisol (Hypothesis 4) and RSA\n(Hypothesis 5) responses to stress than did depressed individuals as-\nsigned to the Sham-RNI condition, we will use hierarchical linear\nmodeling (HLM; Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002). This approach allows us\nto model the repeated measurements of both cortisol and RSA within\npersons as a function of time, and permits the examination of unevenly\nspaced measurement occasions (Hruschka et al., 2005). Thus, the exact\ntime of cortisol and RSA collection will be allowed to vary by in-\ndividual, which provides a precise estimation of collection timepoints\n\n\nE Jopling, et al.

Based on\nvisual inspection of the data, deviance statistics, and the AIC value, the\nquadratic growth model best fit the pattern of cortisol production.\nTo examine the basic pattern of cortisol response to the TSST, we\nfirst ran a baseline model without any variables at Level\n\n, and significantly increased in\nresponse to the stressor, B = 0.01, ¢(38) =2.27,p = .029. Although the\nrate of change in cortisol level over time (i.e. the quadratic slope) was\nnot significant, B = —0.00, (109) = —1.65, p = .103, all estimates of\nvariance components were significant (all ps < 0.001), indicating in-\ndividual differences in the variation in cortisol levels at baseline and\nover time (linear and quadratic slopes).\n\nNext, we tested variables shown to influence cortisol responses to\nstress as potential covariates: age, use of oral contraceptives, current\nuse of psychotropic medication, past use of psychotropic medication,\nand engagement in exercise on the day of the session (Kudielka et al.,\n2004, 2009).

Associations between change in negative intrusion effects and key\noutcomes\n\nWe conducted exploratory analyses to examine whether change in\nnegative intrusions was associated with change in symptoms of de-\npression, change in rumination, and degree of biological responses to\nstress, and to test whether these associations differed by condition.\nAnalyses indicated that neither change in negative intrusions nor the\ninteraction between condition and change in negative intrusions was\nassociated with change in symptoms of depression or with change in\nlevels of rumination, ps > 0.150 (detailed results presented in Table $3\n\nof the online supplement). Similarly, neither change in negative intru-\nsions nor the interaction between condition and change in negative\n\nintrusions predicted cortisol responses to stress, ps > 0.435 (detailed\n\nresults presented in the text of the online supplement).\n\nFurther, the interaction between condition and change in negative in-\ntrusion effects was significant at a trend level for baseline levels of RSA,\n\nB = —0.004, (35) = —2.00,p = .053. Within the Real-RNI condition,\n\ngreater change in negative intrusions was associated with a briefer RSA\nwithdrawalgduringgtheganticipationgperiod FB E=I=0:0001;91(19)\n= —2.14, p = .045, and with faster RSA recovery during the initial\nstress reactivity period; B/=10.0004;1(19)=12:73; pi=r:013. Withimthe\nSham-RNI condition, greater change in negative intrusions predicted\nhigher levels of RSA at baseline, B = 0.003, (16) = 2.70, p = .016,\nwith greater pre- to post-training improvement in removing negative\ninformation from WM predicting higher levels of RSA at baseline.\nDetailed results are presented in the text of the online supplement.\n\n5. Discussion\n\nThis study is the first to experimentally examine the effects of\ntraining depressed individuals to remove negative information from\nWM on cognition, affect, and biological responses to stress. Previous\nWM training paradigms have focused predominantly on non-valenced\nstimuli (Course-Choi et al, 2017; Onraedt and Koster, 2014;\nOwens et al, 2013); this study is the first to examine the effects of\naffective WM training with a clinically depressed sample. Using\n\n\nE Jopling, et al.\n\nmultiple indicators of biological functioning, we found that depressed\nindividuals assigned to the Real-RNI training condition exhibited less\nbiological reactivity in response to the stressor than did depressed in-\ndividuals assigned to the Sham-RNI training condition. In addition,\ncontrary to our hypotheses, all participants significantly improved in\ntheir ability to remove negative information from WM and reported\nsignificant decreases in both symptoms of depression and levels of ru-\nmination. In other words, there was no significant effect of Real-RNI\ncompared to Sham-RNI training on pre- to post-training change in ne-\ngative intrusions, symptoms of depression, or levels of rumination.\n\nUnexpectedly, participants in both conditions significantly im-\nproved from pre- to post-training in removing emotional information\nfrom WM. There are several possible explanations for this finding. First,\nthe lexical decision task completed by participants in the Sham-RNI\ncondition may have engaged the neural systems involved in WM, such\nas subregions of the prefrontal cortex (Courtney et al., 1997; Curtis and\nDiEsposito, 2003). Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that both lexical\ndecision tasks and verbal WM tasks are associated with increased ac-\ntivation of regions such as the anterior cingulate gyrus and left inferior\nfrontal gyrus (Chen and Desmond, 2005; Phan et al., 2005; Zhang et al.,\n2003). Thus, it is possible that the real and sham tasks may have been\nactivating structures in the same neural system (McNamara and\nAltarriba, 1988). However, it is important to note that the lexical de-\ncision task does not involve the same degree of active engagement that\nis required by the modified Sternberg task (Roediger, 1990). Reviews of\nthe CBM literature argue that, while training and control conditions\nmay involve exposure to identical stimuli, the critical difference be-\ntween conditions is whether the stimuli are actively processed in a\nmanner that is transfer-appropriate to the variables of interest\n(Hertel and Mathews, 2011). This argument is supported by a number\nof empirical studies demonstrating that active training (beyond sti-\nmulus exposure) is required for successful modification of cognitive\nprocesses (Hoppitt et al., 2010; Mathews and Mackintosh, 2000). It is\nalso possible that participants in both conditions improved significantly\nfrom pre- to post-training in negative intrusions, symptoms of depres-\nsion, and levels of rumination because of a regression to the mean or\nbecause of natural temporal fluctuations in these phenomena\n(Barnett et al., 2005). The equivalent changes across conditions could\nalso be attributed to our use of an active control group, which may have\nserved as a form of behavioral activation, as participants in both con-\nditions completed cognitive tasks daily. To test for this possibility, fu-\nture work should consider the use of a wait-list control condition, which\ncould allow us to gain a better understanding of the reasons why in-\ndividuals in the control condition improved on both affective and\ncognitive measures. Finally, all participants completed the affective\nSternberg task at baseline: this single training session may have been\nsufficient to improve participants’ ability to control the contents of WM.\nConsistent with this possibility, researchers have found training-related\neffects to emerge after a single session of cognitive bias modification\ntraining in samples of depressed individuals (Cohen et al, 2015;\nTran et al., 2011; Yiend et al., 2014).\n\nImportantly, we found that biological responses to stress at post-\ntraining differed by training condition. Compared to participants in the\nSham-RNI condition, participants in the Real-RNI condition exhibited\nattenuated cortisol and RSA responses to stress. Moreover, for in-\ndividuals who completed Real-RNI training, greater pre- to post-\ntraining improvement in removing negative information from WM was\nassociated with more flexible RSA withdrawal and augmentation across\nthe preparation and initial stress reactivity periods. Among participants\nwho completed Sham-RNI training, greater pre- to post-training im-\nprovement in removing negative information from WM was associated\nwith higher levels of RSA at baseline. Thus, the current study provides\nevidence that difficulty removing negative information from WM is\nassociated with exaggerated biological responses to stress. This finding\nis particularly important given the effects of chronic biological dysre-\ngulation on neural, cardiovascular, autonomic, and immune systems\n\n50\n\nJournal of Affective Disorders 265 (2020) 45-51\n\n(Golbidi et al., 2015; McEwen, 2008), and on risk for the recurrence of\ndepressive episodes (Appelhof et al, 2006; Morris et al, 2012;\nYaroslavsky et al., 2014). It is interesting to speculate why we might\nhave found significant differences between training conditions in bio-\nlogical responses to stress, but not in negative intrusions, depression, or\nrumination. One possibility is that the benefits of CBM protocols are not\nfully realized until participants encounter stress. Indeed, this proposi-\ntion is consistent with results from the meta-analysis conducted by\nHallion and Ruscio (2011), in which they found more robust effects of\nCBM procedures following a stressor. However, in light of the finding\nthat participants in the Real-RNI and Sham-RNI training conditions did\nnot differ in pre- to post-training changes in working memory biases,\nsymptoms of depression, or levels of rumination, it is important to ac-\nknowledge that the observed group differences in biological responses\nto stress could reflect false positive results. Thus, it is critical to re-\nplicate the findings reported here.\n\nTwo limitations of the present study warrant discussion. First, all\nparticipants completed the affective Sternberg task at pre-training.\nResearchers have suggested that exposing a control group (i.e. Sham-\nRNI condition) to tasks similar to those used in active training has the\npotential to improve their WM performance (Onraedt and\nKoster, 2014). Thus, future work should use different tasks for assess-\nment and training. Second, a long-term follow-up was not included in\nthe present study. Although we did document training-related effects, it\nwill be important for future work to assess long-term changes in\nmemory performance following RNI training.\n\nThe present study extends the CBM literature by manipulating a\ncognitive process that is central to depression and by examining the\neffects of this manipulation on cognitive, affective, and biological\nfunctioning. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that participants in\nboth the Real-RNI and Sham-RNI training conditions improved from\npre- to post-training in negative intrusions, symptoms of depression,\nand levels of rumination. However, our results do provide preliminary\nexperimental evidence that cognitive control deficits contribute to\ndysregulated biological responses to stress, a finding that is critical\ngiven the prospective association between dysregulated biological re-\nsponses to stress and trajectories of illness in MDD (Morris and\nRao, 2014; Morris et al., 2012). Indeed, the present study is the first to\nexperimentally test the associations among difficulties removing nega-\ntive information from WM, symptoms of depression, levels of rumina-\ntion, and biological responses to stress in depressed individuals. It is\ncritical that investigators continue to conduct research in this area. In\nparticular, future research should investigate whether the effects of\ntraining observed in the current study persist across time. Further, it\nwill be important for future studies to examine the neural mechanisms\nunderlying RNI training to elucidate precisely the ways in which CBM\nparadigms achieve their beneficial effects.\n\nFunding\n\n‘This research was supported by National Institute of Mental Health\n(NIMH) Grants R21-MH101545 (to IHG), F32-MH102013 (to JL), and\nby the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation (formerly NARSAD)\n‘Young Investigator Award 22,337 (to JL).
