Thus, there is a crucial need to identify processes that contribute to the maintenance ofdepressive episodes. Di \ufb03culty removing negative information from working memory (WM) is posited to ex-acerbate a \ufb00ective, cognitive, and biological dysregulation in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), but this has notyet been tested empirically.Methods: In this study we examined whether training depressed individuals to remove negative informationfrom WM (RNI training) would reduce symptoms of depression and levels of rumination, and would be asso-ciated with attenuated biological responsivity to stress. Individuals diagnosed with MDD were randomly as-signed to complete Real-RNI training or Sham-RNI training for six days.Results: Across conditions, participants exhibited signi \ufb01cant improvements from pre- to post-training in re-moving negative information from WM, symptoms of depression, and rumination. Furthermore, participants inthe Real-RNI condition showed a more attenuated pattern of cortisol and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)responses to stress than did participants in the Sham-RNI training condition.Limitations: We did not assess the long-term e\ufb00 ects of training. It will be important for future research to ex-amine whether the documented training-related e\ufb00 ects persist across time.Conclusions: This study is the \ufb01rst to examine the e\ufb00 ects of RNI training on clinical symptoms and biologicalresponses to stress in MDD, and it provides experimental evidence that training individuals with depression toremove negative information from WM can help to modulate the heightened biological responses to stress seenin depression.1. IntroductionMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by di \ufb03culty re-moving negative information from working memory (WM; LeMoult andGotlib, 2019 ;World Health Organization, 2012 ). Although researchershave posited that di \ufb03culty removing negative information from WMcontributes to depressive symptoms, rumination, and exaggerated bio-logical responses to stress ( Joormann, 2010; LeMoult and Gotlib, 2019;Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008 ), there has been no research to date thatexperimentally examines the associations among these variables in thecontext of depression. Consequently, we do not fully understand theways in which di \ufb03culty removing negative information from WMcontributes to MDD.To date, only one study has experimentally examined the e \ufb00ects ofdi\ufb03culty removing information from WM on symptoms of depressionand levels of rumination ( Onraedt and Koster, 2014). In that study,participants with MDD and high levels of trait rumination completed sixsessions of training on a dual n-back task. Although performance on thedual n-back task signi \ufb01cantly improved from pre- to post-training, thisgain did not transfer to measures of depression, rumination, or alter-native measures of WM. It is possible that Onraedt and Koster (2014)did not \ufb01nd transfer e \ufb00ects because participants were trained to removenon-valenced information from WM, which does not directly target thecore di \ufb03culty underlying levels of rumination and depressive symp-toms observed in MDD: di \ufb03culty removing negatively valenced in-formation from WM (for reviews see Joormann and Stanton, 2016;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.01.007Received 25 October 2019; Received in revised form 1 January 2020; Accepted 3 January 2020\u204eCorresponding author.E-mail address: ellen.jopling@psych.ubc.ca (E. Jopling).1Equal contribution.Journal of Affective Disorders 265 (2020) 45\u201351Available online 07 January 20200165-0327/ \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.TLeMoult and Gotlib, 2019 ). While there is some evidence that a \ufb00ectiveWM training can result in improved control over a \ufb00ective informationin non-clinical samples ( Schweizer et al., 2011, 2013), the associationsamong removing negative information from WM, rumination, and de-pression have not been examined experimentally, and not within asample of participants with MDD.Although researchers have also not yet examined the associationbetween di \ufb03culties in WM disengagement and dysregulated biologicalresponses to stress, studies assessing constructs related to WM disen-gagement provide a degree of support for this association. For example,researchers have documented that ruminative responses to stress areassociated with impaired recovery of both the neuroendocrine andautonomic nervous systems ( Key et al., 2008), particularly for in-dividuals with MDD ( LeMoult and Joormann, 2014 ). For example, bothMDD and ruminative responses to stress have been linked with ex-cessive respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) withdrawal in response tostress ( Beauchaine, 2015 ;LeMoult et al., 2015 ). Given the associationbetween di \ufb03culty disengaging from negative material in WM and ru-mination ( LeMoult and Gotlib, 2019), there is reason to expect thatdi\ufb03culty disengaging from negative information in WM might underliethe dysregulated biological responses to stress documented in MDD.However, this possibility has not yet been experimentally examined.The cognitive bias modi \ufb01cation (CBM) literature highlights theimportance of manipulating cognitive processes to test causal relationsand to identify mechanisms that might underlie the onset of MDD(Hallion and Ruscio, 2011). Investigators have contended that thestrongest advances in our understanding of how CBM paradigmsachieve their e \ufb00ects will come from the assessment of training-relatedchanges across multiple domains. Underscoring this point, previousstudies using CBM paradigms have demonstrated that training in-dividuals to alter the way they process information can result inchanges in cognition, a \ufb00ect, and biology. These studies help to establishcausal associations between cognitive biases and both a \ufb00ective andbiological functioning ( Hertel and Mathews, 2011). To date, much ofthe CBM literature has targeted attentional and interpretation biases inthe context of anxiety disorders ( Hallion and Ruscio, 2011;Macleod and Mathews, 2012). Thus, studies are needed that investigatethe cognitive, a \ufb00ective, and biological e \ufb00ects of training participantswith MDD to remove negative information from WM.The present study was designed to extend the CBM literature bytesting the e \ufb00ects of training depressed individuals to remove negativeinformation (RNI training) from WM on cognitive, a \ufb00ective, and bio-logical functioning. We assigned individuals diagnosed with MDD toeither the Real-RNI or Sham RNI condition for six days. We measuredindividual di \ufb00erences in the ability to remove negative informationfrom WM, symptoms of depression, and levels of rumination at bothpre- and post-training sessions. In addition, at post-training, partici-pants completed a standardized laboratory-based stressor, during whichwe measured biological responsivity. We predicted that, compared toparticipants in the Sham-RNI condition, participants in the Real-RNIcondition would exhibit greater improvements from pre- to post-training in removing negative information from WM (Hypothesis 1).Further,we expected that, compared to participants assigned to theSham-RNI condition, participants assigned to the Real-RNI conditionwould report greater pre- to post-training decreases in symptoms ofdepression (Hypothesis 2) and levels of rumination (Hypothesis 3), andwould exhibit attenuated biological responses across the laboratorystressor as measured by cortisol (Hypothesis 4) and RSA (Hypothesis 5).2. Method2.1. ParticipantsAdults between 18 and 60 years of age were eligible to participate inthis study if they were \ufb02uent in English and met criteria for currentMDD or had no past or current psychopathology (CTLs). We recruitedCTL participants in order to con \ufb01rm that our sample of depressedparticipants had, at pre-training, signi \ufb01cantly higher self-reportedsymptoms of depression and rumination, and signi \ufb01cantly greater dif-\ufb01culty removing negative information from WM. Diagnostic status wasdetermined using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV;First et al., 1996 ). Participants were excluded if they had majormedical conditions, head trauma, bipolar disorder, symptoms of psy-chosis, an alcohol or substance use disorder in the past 6 months, orconditions know to a \ufb00ect the neuroendocrine or autonomic nervoussystems.Of the 90 individuals (54 with MDD and 36 CTLs) who were eligiblefollowing the SCID-IV, seven participants with MDD did not completethe post-training session and \ufb01ve participants with MDD had substantialdi\ufb03culties following directions (e.g., did not properly complete thebaseline assessment or did not complete any at-home trainings). Thus,the\ufb01nal sample consisted of 78 participants (42 with MDD and 36CTLs) who were between 19 and 55 years of age. The \ufb01nal sample ofparticipants did not di \ufb00er at pre-training from the 12 individualswithout complete data on any clinical or demographic characteristics,allps > 0 .05.2.2. Working memory bias taskDi\ufb03culty eliminating positive and negative information from WMwas assessed using the a \ufb00ective version of the Sternberg task(Joormann and Gotlib, 2008). The task consists of three blocks of 40trials. Each trial consisted of a learning display, a cue display, and aprobe-recognition display. During the learning display, participantsviewed two sets of three words. Following the o \ufb00set of the word sets,participants viewed a cue that indicated which set of words would berelevant for the probe-recognition display; this prompted participantsto remove the other (irrelevant) set of words from WM. Of the 120trials, 40% required that participants remove the positive word set and40% required that participants remove the negative word set. The \ufb01nal20% of trials were control trials, which included positive and negativewords in both sets; these trials were included to ensure that participantsdid not learn to make decisions about the probe based on word valence.Finally, in the probe-recognition display, a single word was presentedand participants were given 3000 ms to indicate as quickly and as ac-curately as possible whether the probe word was from the relevantword set. The probe word could be from the relevant set, the irrelevantset, or a novel word that was not included in either set. Consistent withprevious research ( Joormann and Gotlib, 2008 ), individual di \ufb00erencesin the ability to remove irrelevant information from WM were modeledas decision latencies to words from the irrelevant set minus the decisionlatencies to new words of the same valence. These di \ufb00erences in re-sponse times are termed intrusion e\ufb00 ectsand were calculated separatelyfor positive and negative words. Di \ufb03culty removing information fromWMresults in larger intrusion e \ufb00ects. Psychometric properties for theSternberg were good: split-half reliability coe \ufb03cients on critical trialRTs ranged from 0.78 to 0.96.2.3. Working memory trainingUsing strati \ufb01ed random assignment based on their scores on theBeck Depression Inventory-II, participants with MDD were assigned toeither the Real-RNI ( n= 22) or the Sham-RNI ( n= 20) condition. Inboth conditions, participants completed an at-home training sessioneach day for six days. Training tasks were administered using E-Primesoftware version 2 on laptop computers provided to participants. Eachtraining session lasted 15\u2013 20 min and performance \ufb01les were stored onthe computer until participants returned the laptop at their post-training session. Consistent with previous research, analyses were re-stricted to trials in which participants made correct responses and inwhich reaction times (RTs) were less than 3000 ms ( Joormann andGotlib, 2008). This resulted in the loss of 9.21% of trials at pre-trainingE. Jopling, et al. Journal of Affective Disorders 265 (2020) 45\u20135146and 7.86% of trials at post-training, which is consistent with previousstudies ( LeMoult, Yoon, and Joormann, 2015; LeMoult, and Joormann,2014 ). Participants in the two conditions did not di \ufb00er from each otherin the percentage of trials lost at pre-training or post-training, ps>0.201.2.3.1. Real RNIParticipants in the Real-RNI condition were presented with anadapted version of the original a \ufb00ective Sternberg Task that wascompleted during the pre-training session. The original and trainingtasks di \ufb00ered in length and in percentage of each type of trial. Of the 60trials completed during each training session, 80% of trials requiredthat participants remove the negative word set, 10% required thatparticipants remove the positive word set (to ensure that participantshad reason to continue learning both positive and negative word sets),and 10% were control trials.2.3.2. Sham RNIParticipants in the Sham-RNI condition were presented with amodi\ufb01ed lexical decision task. In each trial, participants were presentedwith a string of letters and were required to indicate whether the stringformed a real word. Of the 360 trials, 50% of trials presented nonsensewords, and 50% presented the same words that were used in the Real-RNI task. Thus, participants in the Real-RNI and Sham-RNI conditionswere exposed to the same wordlists each day (additional details in theonline supplement).2.4. Psychosocial stressorTo examine participants \u2019biological responses to stress, participantscompleted the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum et al., 1993 )during the post-training lab session. The TSST is a standardized stressorthat has been found to be e \ufb00ective in eliciting a biological stress re-sponse ( Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004 ). It consists of four phases:baseline (20 min), anticipation (10 min), stressor (10 min), and re-covery (30 min). Neuroendocrine (salivary cortisol) and autonomic(RSA) responses were measured throughout the task. See online sup-plement for further details.2.4.1. CortisolSaliva samples were collected immediately before the baselineperiod (S1), immediately after the baseline period (S2), immediatelyafter the stressor (S3), 15 min after stressor o \ufb00set (S4), and 30 min afterstressor o \ufb00set (S5). This collection schedule is based on meta-analytic\ufb01ndings of the timing of cortisol reactivity and recovery ( Dickerson andKemeny, 2004 ). Cortisol values were winsorized to 2 standard devia-tions above the mean as is consistent with previous research(Doom et al., 2013; Gotlib et al., 2015 ).2.4.2. RSAAutonomic data were recorded continuously using the Biopacsystem. ECG signals were transmitted using three electrodes positionedin a modi \ufb01ed lead II con \ufb01guration. Respiration was measured using arespiratory belt placed around the chest and the abdomen. RSA wasscored in 1-minute epochs using AcqKnowledge 4.0 software, and wascalculated as the natural log of the high frequency power(0.15 \u20130.40 Hz). Consistent with Kircanski et al. (2016) , we created thefollowing segments: baseline (10 min), anticipation (5 min), speech task(5 min), arithmetic task (5 min), initial recovery (15 min), and \ufb01nalrecovery (15 min).3. Self-report measures3.1. Symptoms of depressionThe severity of participants \u2019symptoms of depression was assessedwith the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996 ), a 21-item self-report questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms experi-enced in the previous two weeks. In addition, at the pre- and post-training sessions, participants completed a modi \ufb01ed BDI-II scale (M-BDI-II) that assessed depressive symptoms in the previous three days. Inthe present study, there was excellent internal consistency in both theoriginal and modi \ufb01ed versions of the BDI-II ( \u03b1s\u22650.92).3.1.1. RuminationRumination was assessed with the Ruminative Responses Scale(Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow, 1991), a 22-item self-report ques-tionnaire designed to measure individual di \ufb00erences in the tendency toruminate when feeling depressed. In addition, at the pre- and post-training session, participants completed a modi \ufb01ed RRS (M-RRS) thatassessed rumination in the previous three days. In the current study,there was excellent internal consistency in both the original and mod-i\ufb01ed versions of the RRS ( \u03b1s\u22650.93).3.2. ProcedureThe study was approved by the Stanford University InstitutionalReview Board. Following previous CBM studies ( Hallion andRuscio, 2011 ;Koster and Hoorelbeke, 2015), data were collected in amulti-session procedure. Participants \ufb01rst came into the lab to completethe SCID and self-report measures of symptoms of depression (BDI-II)and rumination (RRS). Eligible participants were invited to return tothe lab within two weeks for the pre-training session, during which theycompleted the Sternberg Task and reported on their symptoms of de-pression (M-BDI-II) and rumination (M-RRS) within the past three days.Participants were then assigned to complete either Real-RNI or Sham-RNI training at home for the next six consecutive days. On the seventhday, participants returned to the lab for the post-training session,during which participants completed the same cognitive and self-reportmeasures completed during the pre-training session, and the TSST.3.3. Statistical analysesTo examine whether depressed individuals who were assigned tothe Real-RNI condition exhibited greater improvements from pre- topost-training than did depressed individuals who were assigned to theSham-RNI condition in removing negative information from WM(Hypothesis 1), we will conduct a three-way Condition (Real RNI, ShamRNI) by Valence (positive, negative) by Time (pre-training, post-training) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on intrusione\ufb00ects. If the expected three-way interaction is signi \ufb01cant, we willconduct follow-up two-way ANOVAs within each condition, for eachvalence, and at each time point, followed by paired or independentsample t-tests as indicated. To examine whether depressed individualsassigned to the Real-RNI condition exhibit greater improvements frompre- to post-training than depressed individuals assigned to the Sham-RNI condition in symptoms of depression (Hypothesis 2) and levels ofrumination (Hypothesis 3), we will conduct a two-way Condition byTime repeated-measures ANOVAs on BDI-II and on RRS scores. If theexpected two-way interaction is signi \ufb01cant, we will conduct in-dependent-samples t-tests at pre- and post-training, and paired-samplest-tests for participants in both the Real-RNI and Sham-RNI condition.To examine whether depressed individuals assigned to the Real-RNIcondition exhibited attenuated cortisol (Hypothesis 4) and RSA(Hypothesis 5) responses to stress than did depressed individuals as-signed to the Sham-RNI condition, we will use hierarchical linearmodeling (HLM; Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002 ). This approach allows usto model the repeated measurements of both cortisol and RSA withinpersons as a function of time, and permits the examination of unevenlyspaced measurement occasions ( Hruschka et al., 2005 ). Thus, the exacttime of cortisol and RSA collection will be allowed to vary by in-dividual, which provides a precise estimation of collection timepointsE. Jopling, et al. Journal of Affective Disorders 265 (2020) 45\u20135147for each participant. Linear, quadratic, and piecewise models will beevaluated for both cortisol and RSA. We will select the model that best\ufb01ts the data based on the smallest value of Akaikie's Information Cri-teria (AIC) and visual inspection of the data. Condition will be dummy-coded with the Sham-RNI condition as the referent group, and will beincluded at Level 2. Models will be \ufb01t using full information maximumlikelihood for the calculation of deviance and AIC, and \ufb01t using re-stricted maximum likelihood for the estimation of model parameters.See supplement for all HLM equations.4. Results4.1. Di \ufb00erences between MDD and CTL groupsClinical and demographic characteristics of participants are pre-sented in Table 1. Participants with MDD did not di \ufb00er signi \ufb01cantlyfrom CTLs with respect to age, gender, racial background, maritalstatus, years of education, or income, all ps > 0 .05. As expected,however, at pre-training, participants with MDD had signi \ufb01cantlyhigher levels of depressive symptoms, t(49) = \u221216.09, p< .001,g= 3.43, and rumination, t(71) = \u221215.46, p< .001, g= 3.42, thandid CTLs. MDD participants also had signi \ufb01cantly greater negative in-trusions e \ufb00ects on the Sternberg task than did CTL participants, t(76)=\u22122.05, p= .044, g= 0.46, indicating that they had more di \ufb03cultyremoving negative information from WM.4.2. Di \ufb00erences between depressed participants in the real-RNI and sham-RNI conditionsParticipants with MDD who received Real-RNI training did notdi\ufb00er signi \ufb01cantly from those who received Sham-RNI training withrespect to age, gender, racial background, marital status, years ofeducation, income, number of at-home training sessions completed, orbaseline symptoms of depression, rumination, negative intrusion ef-fects, or positive intrusion e \ufb00ects, ps>0.05.4.3.

The main e \ufb00ect ofage was not signi \ufb01cant, and age did not interact signi \ufb01cantly with time,valence, or condition to predict intrusion scores, ps> 0.211.4.3.2. Depression (Hypothesis 2)The repeated-measures ANOVA conducted on symptoms of de-pression yielded a main e \ufb00ect of time, F(1,39) = 6.97, p= .012, \u03b72=0.15, re \ufb02ecting a signi \ufb01cant decline from pre- to post-training in de-pressive symptoms. No other e \ufb00ects were signi \ufb01cant, ps> 0.078.4.3.3. Rumination (Hypothesis 3)The repeated-measures ANOVA on rumination yielded a signi \ufb01cantmain e \ufb00ect of time, F(1,39) = 10.62, p= .002, \u03b72= 0.21, re \ufb02ecting asigni\ufb01cant pre- to post-training decline in levels of rumination. No othere\ufb00ects were signi \ufb01cant, ps> 0.160.4.3.4. Cortisol responses to stress (Hypothesis 4)Cortisol response to stress is presented by condition in Fig. 1 and allresults can be found in Table S1 of the online supplement. Based onvisual inspection of the data, deviance statistics, and the AIC value, thequadratic growth model best \ufb01t the pattern of cortisol production.To examine the basic pattern of cortisol response to the TSST, we\ufb01rst ran a baseline model without any variables at Level 2. Participants \u2019average cortisol level was signi \ufb01cantly di \ufb00erent than zero at baseline, B=\u22120.24, t(38) = \u22122.32, p= .026, and signi \ufb01cantly increased inresponse to the stressor, B= 0.01, t(38) =2.27, p= .029. Although therate of change in cortisol level over time (i.e. the quadratic slope) wasnot signi \ufb01cant, B=\u22120.00, t(109) = \u22121.65, p= .103, all estimates ofvariance components were signi \ufb01cant (all ps< 0.001), indicating in-dividual di \ufb00erences in the variation in cortisol levels at baseline andover time (linear and quadratic slopes).Next, we tested variables shown to in \ufb02uence cortisol responses tostress as potential covariates: age, use of oral contraceptives, currentuse of psychotropic medication, past use of psychotropic medication,and engagement in exercise on the day of the session ( Kudielka et al.,2004 ,2009 ). Use of oral contraceptives and psychotropic medicationTable 1Clinical and demographic characteristics.Participants with MDD ControlsVariable Real RNI Sham RNI TotalAge, M (SD) 28.00 (5.58) 29.50 (9.40) 28.71 (7.58) 29.71 (10.25)Gender,% female 68.2 70.0 69.0 66.7Racial background,% white 69.6 60.0 64.3 60.6Marital status,% single 72.7 80.0 76.2 62.9Years of education, M (SD) 15.32 (3.58) 16.70 (2.62) 15.98 (3.20) 14.79 (3.58)Number trainings completed, M (SD) 5.82 (0.50) 5.95 (0.39) 5.88 (0.45) \u2014BDI-II, M (SD) 30.14 (11.30) 27.45 (9.34) 28.86 (10.38) 1.53 (2.36)RRS, M (SD) 62.55 (12.16) 58.45 (8.86) 60.60 (10.79) 30.44 (9.25)Pre-TrainingM-BDI-II, M (SD) 31.90 (10.31) 26.47 (9.14) 29.39 (10.05) 2.69 (3.20)M-RRS, M (SD) 56.46 (9.82) 52.32 (7.36) 54.54 (8.91) 27.80 (6.09)Negative intrusion e \ufb00ects, M (SD) 352.01 (220.87) 446.84 (218.32) 397.17 (222.20) 298.71 (199.04)Positive intrusion e \ufb00ects, M (SD) 397.44 (201.67) 411.78 (242.13) 404.27 (219.20) 382.84 (196.98)Post-TrainingM-BDI-II, M (SD) 28.14 (10.55) 22.50 (11.35) 25.45 (11.18) \u2014M-RRS, M (SD) 52.50 (11.02) 49.05 (9.76) 50.86 (10.46) \u2014Negative intrusion e \ufb00ects, M (SD) 297.24 (177.82) 301.87 (224.58) 299.44 (198.93) \u2014Positive intrusion e \ufb00ects, M (SD) 308.62 (208.71) 313.92 (323.18) 311.14 (265.93) \u2014Note: BDI-II = Beck Depression Inventory-II, RRS = Ruminative Responses Scale, M-BDI-II = Modi \ufb01ed Beck Depression Inventory-II (previous three days), M-RRS = Modi \ufb01ed Ruminative Response Scale (previous three days) .E.

Based onvisual inspection of the data, deviance statistics, and the AIC value, RSAdata were best \ufb01t with a piecewise linear growth model, which esti-mated the slope of RSA across baseline, anticipation, initial stress re-activity, subsequent stress reactivity, initial recovery, and \ufb01nal recoveryphases of the stressor, as is consistent with previous work ( Waugh et al.,2010 ).A baseline model without any Level 2 predictors indicated thatparticipants \u2019level of RSA at baseline was signi \ufb01cantly di \ufb00erent fromzero, B= 7.43, t(38) =32.88, p<.001, remained constant during theanticipation period, B=\u22120.02, t(38) =\u22121.88, p= .067, and thensigni\ufb01cantly declined during the initial stress reactivity period, B=\u22120.14, t(38) = \u22125.28, p< .001. Levels of RSA remained constantacross the subsequent stress reactivity phase, B= 0.003, t(38) = 0.33,p= .742, signi \ufb01cantly increased across the initial recovery period,B= 0.05, t(38) = 8.37, p< .001, and remained constant across the\ufb01nal recovery period, B=\u22120.003, t(38) = \u22120.67, p= .508.Next, we tested variables shown to in \ufb02uence RSA response to stressas potential covariates: age, current use of psychotropic medication,past use of psychotropic medication, and engagement in exercise on theday of the session ( Grossman et al., 2004 ;O'Regan et al., 2015;Voss et al., 2015 ). Both past and current use of psychotropic medicationpredicted the slope of RSA during the \ufb01nal recovery period, ps< 0.018.Consequently, these variables were included as covariates in the cor-responding Level 2 equation.As expected, participants in the Real-RNI condition exhibited amore attenuated pattern of RSA response to stress than did participantsin the Sham-RNI condition. Speci \ufb01cally, compared to participants in theSham-RNI condition, participants in the Real-RNI condition had lessRSA withdrawal in response to the speech (initial stress reactivity),B= 0.15, t(37) = 3.14, p= .003, and less RSA augmentation in re-sponse to the arithmetic task (subsequent stress reactivity), B=\u22120.05,t(37) = \u22122.63, p= .012.4.4. Associations between change in negative intrusion e \ufb00ects and keyoutcomesWe conducted exploratory analyses to examine whether change innegative intrusions was associated with change in symptoms of de-pression, change in rumination, and degree of biological responses tostress, and to test whether these associations di \ufb00ered by condition.Analyses indicated that neither change in negative intrusions nor theinteraction between condition and change in negative intrusions wasassociated with change in symptoms of depression or with change inlevels of rumination, ps> 0.150 (detailed results presented in Table S3of the online supplement). Similarly, neither change in negative intru-sions nor the interaction between condition and change in negativeintrusions predicted cortisol responses to stress, ps> 0.435 (detailedresults presented in the text of the online supplement). However, asigni\ufb01cant interaction between condition and change in negative in-trusions predicted RSA trajectory across both the initial stress re-activity, B= 0.001, t(35) = 3.24, p= .003, and subsequent stressreactivity phase of the TSST, B=\u22120.0001, t(35) = \u22122.13, p= .040.Further, the interaction between condition and change in negative in-trusion e \ufb00ects was signi \ufb01cant at a trend level for baseline levels of RSA,B=\u22120.004, t(35) =\u22122.00, p= .053. Within the Real-RNI condition,greaterchange in negative intrusions was associated with a briefer RSAwithdrawal during the anticipation period, B=\u22120.0001, t(19)=\u22122.14, p= .045, and with faster RSA recovery during the initialstress reactivity period, B= 0.0004, t(19) = 2.73, p= .013. Within theSham-RNI condition, greater change in negative intrusions predictedhigher levels of RSA at baseline, B= 0.003, t(16) = 2.70, p= .016,with greater pre- to post-training improvement in removing negativeinformation from WM predicting higher levels of RSA at baseline.Detailed results are presented in the text of the online supplement.5. DiscussionThis study is the \ufb01rst to experimentally examine the e \ufb00ects oftraining depressed individuals to remove negative information fromWM on cognition, a \ufb00ect, and biological responses to stress. PreviousWM training paradigms have focused predominantly on non-valencedstimuli ( Course-Choi et al., 2017; Onraedt and Koster, 2014;Owens et al., 2013 ); this study is the \ufb01rst to examine the e \ufb00ects ofa\ufb00ective WM training with a clinically depressed sample. UsingFig. 1. Pattern of cortisol response to stress by condition.Fig. 2. Pattern of RSA response to stress by condition.E. Jopling, et al. Journal of Affective Disorders 265 (2020) 45\u20135149multiple indicators of biological functioning, we found that depressedindividuals assigned to the Real-RNI training condition exhibited lessbiological reactivity in response to the stressor than did depressed in-dividuals assigned to the Sham-RNI training condition. In addition,contrary to our hypotheses, all participants signi \ufb01cantly improved intheir ability to remove negative information from WM and reportedsigni\ufb01cant decreases in both symptoms of depression and levels of ru-mination. In other words, there was no signi \ufb01cant e \ufb00ect of Real-RNIcompared to Sham-RNI training on pre- to post-training change in ne-gative intrusions, symptoms of depression, or levels of rumination.Unexpectedly, participants in both conditions signi \ufb01cantly im-proved from pre- to post-training in removing emotional informationfrom WM. There are several possible explanations for this \ufb01nding. First,the lexical decision task completed by participants in the Sham-RNIcondition may have engaged the neural systems involved in WM, suchas subregions of the prefrontal cortex ( Courtney et al., 1997 ;Curtis andD'Esposito, 2003 ). Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that both lexicaldecision tasks and verbal WM tasks are associated with increased ac-tivation of regions such as the anterior cingulate gyrus and left inferiorfrontal gyrus ( Chen and Desmond, 2005 ;Phan et al., 2005; Zhang et al.,2003 ). Thus, it is possible that the real and sham tasks may have beenactivating structures in the same neural system ( McNamara andAltarriba, 1988 ). However, it is important to note that the lexical de-cision task does not involve the same degree of active engagement thatis required by the modi \ufb01ed Sternberg task ( Roediger, 1990 ). Reviews ofthe CBM literature argue that, while training and control conditionsmay involve exposure to identical stimuli, the critical di \ufb00erence be-tween conditions is whether the stimuli are actively processed in amanner that is transfer-appropriate to the variables of interest(Hertel and Mathews, 2011 ). This argument is supported by a numberof empirical studies demonstrating that active training (beyond sti-mulus exposure) is required for successful modi \ufb01cation of cognitiveprocesses ( Hoppitt et al., 2010; Mathews and Mackintosh, 2000 ). It isalso possible that participants in both conditions improved signi \ufb01cantlyfrom pre- to post-training in negative intrusions, symptoms of depres-sion, and levels of rumination because of a regression to the mean orbecause of natural temporal \ufb02uctuations in these phenomena(Barnett et al., 2005). The equivalent changes across conditions couldalso be attributed to our use of an active control group, which may haveserved as a form of behavioral activation, as participants in both con-ditions completed cognitive tasks daily. To test for this possibility, fu-ture work should consider the use of a wait-list control condition, whichcould allow us to gain a better understanding of the reasons why in-dividuals in the control condition improved on both a \ufb00ective andcognitive measures. Finally, all participants completed the a \ufb00ectiveSternberg task at baseline: this single training session may have beensu\ufb03cient to improve participants \u2019ability to control the contents of WM.Consistent with this possibility, researchers have found training-relatede\ufb00ectsto emerge after a single session of cognitive bias modi \ufb01cationtraining in samples of depressed individuals ( Cohen et al., 2015;Tran et al., 2011 ;Yiend et al., 2014).Importantly, we found that biological responses to stress at post-training di \ufb00ered by training condition. Compared to participants in theSham-RNI condition, participants in the Real-RNI condition exhibitedattenuated cortisol and RSA responses to stress. Moreover, for in-dividuals who completed Real-RNI training, greater pre- to post-training improvement in removing negative information from WM wasassociated with more \ufb02exible RSA withdrawal and augmentation acrossthe preparation and initial stress reactivity periods. Among participantswho completed Sham-RNI training, greater pre- to post-training im-provement in removing negative information from WM was associatedwith higher levels of RSA at baseline. Thus, the current study providesevidence that di \ufb03culty removing negative information from WM isassociated with exaggerated biological responses to stress. This \ufb01ndingis particularly important given the e \ufb00ects of chronic biological dysre-gulation on neural, cardiovascular, autonomic, and immune systems(Golbidi et al., 2015 ;McEwen, 2008 ), and on risk for the recurrence ofdepressive episodes ( Appelhof et al., 2006 ;Morris et al., 2012;Yaroslavsky et al., 2014 ). It is interesting to speculate why we mighthave found signi \ufb01cant di \ufb00erences between training conditions in bio-logical responses to stress, but notin negative intrusions, depression, orrumination. One possibility is that the bene \ufb01ts of CBM protocols are notfully realized until participants encounter stress. Indeed, this proposi-tion is consistent with results from the meta-analysis conducted byHallion and Ruscio (2011) , in which they found more robust e \ufb00ects ofCBM procedures following a stressor. However, in light of the \ufb01ndingthat participants in the Real-RNI and Sham-RNI training conditions didnot di \ufb00er in pre- to post-training changes in working memory biases,symptoms of depression, or levels of rumination, it is important to ac-knowledge that the observed group di \ufb00erences in biological responsesto stress could re \ufb02ect false positive results. Thus, it is critical to re-plicate the \ufb01ndings reported here.Two limitations of the present study warrant discussion. First, allparticipants completed the a \ufb00ective Sternberg task at pre-training.Researchers have suggested that exposing a control group (i.e. Sham-RNI condition) to tasks similar to those used in active training has thepotential to improve their WM performance ( Onraedt andKoster, 2014). Thus, future work should use di \ufb00erent tasks for assess-ment and training. Second, a long-term follow-up was not included inthe present study. Although we did document training-related e \ufb00ects, itwill be important for future work to assess long-term changes inmemory performance following RNI training.The present study extends the CBM literature by manipulating acognitive process that is central to depression and by examining thee\ufb00ectsof this manipulation on cognitive, a \ufb00ective, and biologicalfunctioning. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that participants inboth the Real-RNI and Sham-RNI training conditions improved frompre- to post-training in negative intrusions, symptoms of depression,and levels of rumination. However, our results do provide preliminaryexperimental evidence that cognitive control de \ufb01cits contribute todysregulated biological responses to stress, a \ufb01nding that is criticalgiven the prospective association between dysregulated biological re-sponses to stress and trajectories of illness in MDD ( Morris andRao, 2014 ;Morris et al., 2012). Indeed, the present study is the \ufb01rst toexperimentally test the associations among di \ufb03culties removing nega-tive information from WM, symptoms of depression, levels of rumina-tion, and biological responses to stress in depressed individuals. It iscritical that investigators continue to conduct research in this area. Inparticular, future research should investigate whether the e \ufb00ects oftraining observed in the current study persist across time. Further, itwill be important for future studies to examine the neural mechanismsunderlying RNI training to elucidate precisely the ways in which CBMparadigms achieve their bene \ufb01cial e\ufb00ects.FundingThis research was supported by National Institute of Mental Health(NIMH) Grants R21-MH101545 (to IHG), F32-MH102013 (to JL), andby the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation (formerly NARSAD)Young Investigator Award 22,337 (to JL).
