      "supporting_text": "Depressed people often complain of concentration difficulties (Watts & Sharrock 1985); indeed, \u201cdifficulty concentrating\u201d is a symptom of a major depressive episode in DSM-IV. In addition, there is a large literature that strongly suggests that depressed individuals are characterized by memory impairments (see Burt et al. 1995, Mathews & MacLeod 2005). In the frequently cited meta-analysis by Burt et al. (1995), memory impairments were reported more consistently for inpatients than for outpatients. Moreover, and not surprisingly, memory impairments were also reported in other psychological disorders. Burt et al. proposed, therefore, that memory deficits are associated with psychopathology in general rather than with depression specifically. Furthermore, in a series of studies, Hertel and collaborators (e.g., Hertel 1998, Hertel & Rude 1991) presented evidence indicating that depression-related impairments are not observed in all components of memory, but are found primarily in free recall tasks and in controlled aspects of recognition. Overall, studies conducted thus far provide evidence that depression is associated with greater memory impairment in contexts in which (a) attention is not constrained by the task (e.g., Hertel & Rude 1991); (b) increased cognitive effort is required (see review by Hartlage et al. 1993); and (c) attention is easily allocated to personal concerns and other thoughts that are irrelevant to the task (Ellis & Ashbrook 1988). Importantly, Hertel & Rude (1991) were able to eliminate a depressive deficit by providing instructions that focused participants on the task and did not allow task irrelevant thoughts. Hertel (1998) also found comparable deficits in recall between dysphoric students who had to wait in an unconstrained situation (without being given any instructions regarding what to do during the waiting period) and dysphoric students who were instructed to rate self-focused material designed to induce rumination. In contrast, no deficit was found for dysphoric students who were instructed what to do during the waiting period (rating self-irrelevant and task-irrelevant material).",

Most of the tasks that are used to assess WM (e.g., the digit span) involve relatively short retention intervals and, thus, seem to allow a more direct assessment of attentional processes irrespective of retrieval from long-term memory. These tasks have been criticized, however, because the relatively slow presentations that are used to ensure perception might allow for chunking and active rehearsal of material and, therefore, might reflect memory deficits rather than deficits in attention (Rokke et al. 2002). Using an attentional blink paradigm that involves rapid serial presentations, Rokke et al. found significant group differences in performance between moderately to severely dysphoric (Beck Depression Inventory scores over 21) and nondysphoric participants, but only under demanding dual-tasking conditions. It is important to note, however, that only nine moderately to severely dysphoric participants were included in this study, so these findings should be interpreted with caution.",

      "supporting_text": "Overall, there is strong evidence for biased memory processes in depression (Mathews & MacLeod 2005). Indeed, preferential recall of negative compared to positive material is one of the most robust findings in the depression literature (Mathews & MacLeod 2005, Matt et al. 1992, Williams et al. 1997). In a meta-analysis of studies assessing recall performance, Matt and colleagues found that people with major depression remembered 10% more negative words than they did positive words. In contrast, nondepressed controls exhibited a memory bias for positive information in 20 of 25 studies. It should be noted, however, that memory biases are found most consistently in free recall tasks, and may be restricted to explicit memory. Results of studies using recognition or implicit memory measures have been much less consistent. In his review of the implicit memory literature, Watkins (2002) reported that, across studies, no bias is found in depressed participants when the encoding and/or the recall of the emotional material depend purely on perceptual processing. For example, if depressed participants are asked to count the letters in emotional words at encoding and to complete word stems or word fragments at recall, no evidence of an implicit memory bias is obtained (Watkins et al. 2000). If, however, participants are asked to rate the recency of their experience with the word or to imagine themselves in a scene involving the word at encoding, and are asked to freely associate to a cue word or to provide a word that fits a given definition, implicit memory biases are obtained more consistently. Encoding and recall in these latter studies require semantic instead of pure perceptual processing of the material. This suggests that depressive deficits are due in large part to differences in the elaboration of the emotional material.",

These findings replicate results reported by Harvey et al. (2004), who found further that the performance deficit on the n-back task was correlated with number of hospitalizations and with the longitudinal course of the disorder. Importantly, Harvey et al. did not find depressionassociated differences on a number of other tasks assessing WM functioning, including a digit span. Consistent with these findings, Egeland et al. (2003) concluded from the results of their study that reduced performance on WM tasks in depression is due not to a specific deficit in executive functioning, but to a nonspecific reduction in speed and to a loss of vigilance that is consistent with a lack of effort. Grant et al. (2001) administered a battery of cognitive tasks to 123 depressed outpatients and noted the surprising absence of cognitive deficits in their sample. The only indications of deficits were fewer completed categories, increased perseveration, and impaired maintenance of set on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), a widely used measure of executive control and cognitive flexibility. These results suggest the operation of depression-related deficits in the generation and maintenance of problem-solving strategies and difficulties in set switching (see also Harvey et al. 2004). Importantly, though, there was no evidence of deficits in executive functioning on any of the other tasks administered in this study. Grant et al. concluded that pervasive cognitive deficits most likely characterize elderly depressed people and severely depressed inpatients who present with psychotic features (see Harvey et al. 2004 and Rose & Ebmeier 2006 for similar conclusions). In a recent review paper, Castaneda et al. (2008) concluded that deficits in certain aspects of executive control and attentional deficits most likely characterize depressed people whereas evidence for learning and memory deficits is more mixed. They also pointed out, however, that there is significant variability in the extent to which studies report deficits and that this variability is due to the subtype of depression",

Moreover, the subliminal priming effect was more closely associated with level of depression than with level of anxiety. Bradley et al.

Three mechanisms have been implicated in the relation between biased cognitive\nprocessing and the dysregulation of emotion in depression: inhibitory processes and deficits in\nworking memory, ruminative responses to negative mood states and negative life events, and the\ninability to use positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood. In this review, we present\na contemporary characterization of depressive cognition and discuss how different cognitive\nprocesses are related not only to cach other, but also to emotion dysregulation, the hallmark feature\nof depression. We conclude that depression is characterized by increased elaboration of negative\ninformation, by difficulties disengaging from negative material, and by deficits in cognitive control\nwhen processing negative information. We discuss treatment implications of these conclusions and\nargue that the study of cognitive aspects of depression must be broadened by investigating neural\nand genetic factors that are related to cognitive dysfunction in this disorder. Such integrative\ninvestigations should help us gain a more comprehensive understanding of how cognitive and\nbiological factors interact to affect the onset, maintenance, and course of depression.\n\nKeywords\n\ndepression; cognition; information-processing biases\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDepression not only changes the way we feel, it also changes how we perceive ourselves and\nthe world around us. There is a long history of research investigating the interaction of cognition\nand emotion in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Clinicians and researchers alike have\nfocused on cognitive processes and on the content of depressive cognition in trying to gain a\nmore comprehensive understanding of MDD. Negative views of the self, the world, and the\nfuture, as well as recurrent and uncontrollable negative thoughts that often revolve around the\nself, are debilitating symptoms of depression. Moreover, biases in cognitive processes such as\nattention and memory may not only be correlates of depressive episodes; they may also play\na critical role in increasing individuals\u2019 vulnerability for the first onset and recurrence of\ndepression.\n\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT\n\u2018The authors are not aware of any affiliations, memberships, funding, or financial holdings that might be perceived as affecting the\nobjectivity of this review,\n\n\n1duosnuep Jouiny vd-HIN duosnuep Jouyny vd-HIN\n\nyduosnueiy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nGotlib and Joormann\n\nPage2\n\nCognitive theories of depression posit that people\u2019s thoughts, inferences, attitudes, and\ninterpretations, and the way in which they attend to and recall events, can increase their risk\nfor the development and recurrence of depressive episodes. Indeed, most cognitive theories\npropose vulnerability-stress hypotheses that posit that the onset of this disorder is due to the\ninteraction of a psychological vulnerability (e.g., certain cognitions or particular ways of\nprocessing information) and a precipitating stressor (c.g., a negative life event or some other\nenvironmental factor). Importantly, one of the most effective interventions for depression,\ncognitive-behavioral therapy, focuses on modifying biased interpretations and dysfunctional\nautomatic thoughts (Beck 1976) and proposes that changes in cognition will lead to\nimprovement of other symptoms of the disorder, including sustained negative affect and\nanhedonia. Consequently, the primary goal of a large body of research has been to gain a more\ncomprehensive understanding of difficulties in cognitive functioning that can result in the\nemotion dysregulation and sustained negative affect that are central to depression. A better\nunderstanding of the nature and role of depressive cognition promises to help advance theories\nof depression and improve treatments for this disorder.\n\nMore than three decades of research on cognitive factors in depression have provided\nimpressive support for many aspects of cognitive formulations of depression. Early studies\nfocused primarily on demonstrating that depressed and nondepressed people differ in the\ncontent of their thoughts. Recent investigations, however, have started to explore the nature of\nthe cognitive deficits and biases in the processing of information that characterize depression.\nWhereas earlier studies used a variety of self-report measures, studies on cognitive biases have\nutilized a wide variety of experimental tasks. These investigations have generally provided\nsupport for the formulation that depression is characterized by negative automatic thoughts\nand biases in attention, interpretation, and memory (Mathews & MacLeod 2005).\n\nDespite the carly promise of cognitive theories of depression, important questions remain. The\nproposition that both depression and anxiety are characterized by biases in all aspects of\ninformation processing, for example, has received little support. A closer comparison of studies\nthat have provided evidence for depression-related biases with studies that have not can lead\nto amore comprehensive characterization of cognitive processing in depression that could have\nimportant implications for models of, and interventions for, depression. Moreover, whereas\nnumerous studies have provided evidence that cognitive biases are present during current\nepisodes of depression, empirical support for the presence of these biases outside of current\nepisodes is more elusive. And even fewer investigators have tested explicitly the diathesis-\nstress model of depression by, for example, assessing biased processing prior to the first onset\nof depression to examine whether it predicts depression following the experience of a negative\nlife event. Finally, there has been little connection between cognitive theories of depression\nand other aspects of depressive functioning. Few studies have examined how deficits in recall,\nattentional biases for negative material, and mood-congruent memory are related to each other\nand, more importantly, how they are related to the hallmark feature of depression\u2014sustained\nnegative affect. Given this critical shortcoming, it is imperative that researchers attempt to\nunderstand the nature of the relation between difficulties or deficits in the processing of\ninformation and the dysregulation of emotion that is central to depressive disorders. As we\ndescribe in detail below, three important mechanisms have been implicated as potential links\nbetween biased attentional/memory processes and emotion dysregulation in depression: biased\ninhibitory processes and deficits in working memory (Joormann 2005); ruminative responses\nto negative mood states and negative life events (Nolen-Hoeksema 2000); and the inability to\nuse positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood (Joormann & Siemer 2004,\nJoormann et al. 2007a).\n\nIn this review, we examine the literature on cognitive biases in depression to provide a\ncontemporary characterization of depressive cognition. We discuss how the different biases\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol.

We then briefly present treatment\nimplications of the conclusions gleaned from these examinations. Finally, in closing, we\nunderscore the position that the study of cognitive aspects of depression must be broadened by\nadopting a more integrative perspective on the processing of emotional stimuli in this disorder.\nIn particular, we highlight the importance of investigating neural aspects of emotion regulation\nand of responsivity to emotional stimuli in understanding MDD. We begin with a brief\noverview of the symptoms and prevalence of depression and then turn to a discussion of\ncognitive theories of this disorder.\n\nDEPRESSION: CLINICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL INFORMATION\n\nMDD is characterized by a constellation of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive symptoms,\nincluding psychomotor agitation or retardation, marked weight loss, insomnia or hyper-somnia,\ndecreased appetite, fatigue, extreme feelings of guilt or worthlessness, concentration\ndifficulties, and suicidal ideation. To meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (DSM-IV-TR; Am. Psychiatr. Assoc. 2000) criteria for a diagnosis of MDD, a set\nof these symptoms has to be present for the same two-week period. Although all of these\nsymptoms are, therefore, important in diagnosing MDD, depression is primarily a disorder of\nemotion dysregulation and sustained negative affect. Indeed, a diagnosis of depression requires\nthe presence of cither sustained negative affect or loss of pleasure. We should also note,\nhowever, that depression is a term that is often used imprecisely, ranging from the\ncharacterization of depressive disorders diagnosed according to DSM criteria, to the\ncharacterization of a temporary mood state in otherwise healthy individuals. Moreover,\nresearchers frequently use the terms \u201cdepression\u201d and \u201cdysphoria\u201d interchangeably: dysphoria\nis commonly referred to as a form of subclinical depression defined by specific cut-off scores\non measures assessing self-reported depressive symptomatology. It is important to be cognizant\nof these distinctions when reviewing the depression literature; in this review, we focus\nprimarily on studies that examined participants diagnosed as depressed according to DSM\ncriteria. Because few researchers have compared dysphoria and depression directly, it is still\nan open question whether results obtained with dysphoric samples generalize to clinically\ndepressed participants.\n\nDepression is among the most prevalent of all psychiatric disorders. Recent estimates indicate\nthat almost 20% of the American population, or more than 30 million adults, will experience\na clinically significant episode of depression at some point in their lives (Kessler & Wang\n\n2009). In fact, the rates of depression are so high that the World Health Organization Global\nBurden of Disease Study ranked depression as the single most burdensome disease in the world\nin terms of total disability-adjusted years among people in the middle years of life (Murray &\n\nLopez 1996). Depression is frequently comorbid with other mental and physical difficulties,\nmost often with anxiety disorders, but also with cardiac problems and smoking (e.g., Carney\n\n& Freedland 2009). Finally, there are significant economic and social costs of depression.\nKessler et al. (2006), for example, estimated that the annual salary-equivalent costs of\ndepression-related lost productivity in the United States exceed $36 billion. There is also\nmounting evidence that depression adversely affects the quality of interpersonal relationships\nand, in particular, relationships with spouses and children. Not only is the rate of divorce higher\namong depressed than among nondepressed individuals (c.g., Wade & Caimey 2000), but\nchildren of depressed parents have also been found to be at elevated risk for psychopathology\n(Joorman et al. 2008).\n\nImportantly, depression is a highly recurrent disorder. More than 75% of depressed patients\nhave more than one depressive episode, often relapsing within two years of recovery from a\ndepressive episode (Boland & Keller 2009). Indeed, between one-half and two-thirds of people\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.\n\n\n1duosnuep Jouiny vd-HIN duosnuep Jouyny vd-HIN\n\nyduosnueiy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nGotlib and Joormann\n\nPage 4\n\nwho have ever been clinically depressed will be in an episode in any given year over the\nremainder of their lives (Kessler & Wang 2009). This high recurrence rate in depression\nsuggests that there are specific factors that increase people\u2019s risk for developing repeated\nepisodes of this disorder. In this review, we focus on one such factor: cognitive functioning\nand cognitive biases in the processing of emotional information.\n\nCOGNITIVE THEORIES OF DEPRESSION\n\nCognitive theories of depression were first formulated about 40 years ago. Even though these\ntheories have provided the impetus for an extraordinarily productive program of research\nattempting to provide empirical evidence for their main propositions, this research has not led\nto substantive changes in cognitive models of this disorder. Beck (1976) postulated that existing\nmemory representations, or schemas, lead individuals to filter stimuli from the environment\nsuch that their attention is directed toward information that is congruent with their schemas.\nBeck theorized that the schemas of depressed persons include themes of loss, separation,\nfailure, worthlessness, and rejection; consequently, depressed individuals will exhibit a\nsystematic bias in their processing of environmental stimuli or information that is relevant to\nthese themes. Because of this bias, depressed people attend selectively to negative stimuli in\ntheir environment and interpret neutral and ambiguous stimuli in a schema-congruent way.\nMoreover, dysfunctional schemas and processing biases are presumed to endure beyond the\ndepressive episode, representing stable vulnerability factors for depression onset and\nrecurrence. When the dysfunctional schemas are activated by stressors, specific negative\ncognitions are generated that take the form of automatic thoughts and revolve around\npessimistic views about the self, the world, and the future\u2014the cognitive triad. In more recent\nversions of this model, Beck differentiated between schemas that involve social relationships\n(sociotropy) and schemas that concern achievement (autonomy; Epstein et al. 1983). Finally,\nBeck\u2019s cognitive specificity hypothesis posits that these schemas are likely to be activated by\ncongruent life events, thereby initiating a vicious cycle of negative automatic thoughts,\nprocessing biases, and depressed mood.\n\nResearch examining processing biases in depression was inspired primarily by Bower\u2019s\n(1981) work on mood and memory. These studies postulate that \u201cassociative networks\u201d lead\nto cognitive biases in depressed individuals. These associative networks consist of numerous\nnodes, each containing specific semantic representations that can be activated by\nenvironmental stimuli. The activation of any one node causes the partial activation, or priming,\nof all the other nodes within its associative network through a process of spreading activation.\nConsequently, the representations of the primed nodes require less activation for access to\noccur than do the representations of nonprimed nodes, resulting in a processing advantage for\nstimuli that are related to these primed representations. Like Beck, Bower also postulates that\nassociative networks are stable constructs; the attentional biases of depressed individuals are\nexpected to endure beyond the depressive episode. Indeed, Ingram (1984) and Teasdale\n(1988) both have drawn on Bower\u2019s theory in explaining the onset, maintenance, and\nrecurrence of depressive disorders. Importantly, virtually all cognitive theories predict that\ndepression is characterized by biased processing of emotional material. We review the\nempirical evidence for this proposition below. First, however, we want to briefly discuss the\nimportant question of whether depression is associated specifically with biases in the\nprocessing of emotional material, or instead is characterized by a more general cognitive deficit\nthat affects the processing of both emotional and nonemotional material.\n\nCOGNITIVE DEFICITS IN DEPRESSION\n\nTwo distinct patterns of cognitive correlates of depression and dysphoria are frequently cited.\nFirst, depressed people report experiencing broad difficulties involving concentration and\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.\n\n\njduosnuepy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nyduosnueiy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nyduosnueiy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nGotlib and Joormann\n\ndistractibility, and impairments in memory, have typically been studied separately from\ncognitive biases, i.e., preferential processing of negative material. Few attempts have been\nmade to integrate findings obtained in these separate lines of research.\n\nOne noteworthy exception is the resource-allocation hypothesis that postulates that because\ntheir cognitive capacity is reduced, depressed individuals have deficits in remembering and in\nengaging in other effortful cognitive processes (e.g., Ellis & Ashbrook 1988). The general\nassumptions are that the amount of resources available for cognitive operations is limited and\nthat depression either occupies or functionally reduces these resources, for example, because\nresources are used by task-irrelevant emotional processing. Thus, deficits should become\nevident in effortful tasks; they should be detectable in effortful, resource-demanding\ncomponents of memory tasks, for example, but not in automatic aspects of these tasks.\nSimilarly, the affective interference hypothesis posits that because depressed persons are\npreoccupied with the processing of emotional material, their performance on tasks that require\nthem to process emotional aspects of stimuli will be fine, but will suffer on tasks that require\nthem to ignore emotional aspects of the stimuli and respond to other aspects of the material\n(Siegle et al. 2002). For example, if depressed individuals are required to make valence\njudgments about words, their tendency to prioritize the processing of emotional material will\naid them. If, however, they are instructed to ignore the emotional content of words while\nmaking a lexical decision judgment, their processing priorities will interfere with this demand\nand their performance will be impaired.\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol.

Importantly, Harvey et al. did not find depression-\nassociated differences on a number of other tasks assessing WM functioning, including a digit\nspan. Consistent with these findings, Egeland et al. (2003) concluded from the results of their\nstudy that reduced performance on WM tasks in depression is due not to a specific deficit in\nexecutive functioning, but to a nonspecific reduction in speed and to a loss of vigilance that is\nconsistent with a lack of effort. Grant et al. (2001) administered a battery of cognitive tasks to\n123 depressed outpatients and noted the surprising absence of cognitive deficits in their sample.\nThe only indications of deficits were fewer completed categories, increased perseveration, and\nimpaired maintenance of set on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), a widely used\nmeasure of executive control and cognitive flexibility. These results suggest the operation of\ndepression-related deficits in the generation and maintenance of problem-solving strategies\nand difficulties in set switching (see also Harvey et al. 2004). Importantly, though, there was\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol.

It is also\nimportant to keep in mind that it can be difficult to differentiate between cognitive deficits and\na lack of motivation that often characterizes depressed patients (Scheurich et al. 2008).\n\nIn sum, surprisingly little empirical support has been found to date for pervasive depressive\ndeficits in general cognitive functioning. Indeed, the bulk of evidence points to depression-\nassociated deficits in the control of attention rather than to limited processing capacity. When\ndepressed participants\u201d attention is well controlled by the demands of the task and they have\nno opportunity to ruminate, no depressive deficits are found. Focusing attention requires\nindividuals to inhibit task-irrelevant thoughts. Thus, the findings reviewed here support the\naffective interference hypothesis and the proposition that depressed individuals are\ncharacterized by reduced cognitive control. These results also suggest that examining how\ndepressed individuals process emotional information may help us gain a better understanding\nof their difficulties in the processing of neutral material.\n\nBIASED PROCESSING OF EMOTIONAL INFORMATION IN DEPRESSION\n\nMemory\n\nCognitive models of depression posit that depressed individuals exhibit cognitive biases in all\naspects of information processing, including memory, interpretation, and perception and\nattention (Mathews & MacLeod 2005). While these theoretical predictions are straightforward,\nthe empirical results are not. For example, a current controversial question concerning\ncognitive theories of emotional disorders is whether there are, in fact, negative biases in\nmemory, interpretation, and attention in depression.\n\nOverall, there is strong evidence for biased memory processes in depression (Mathews &\nMacLeod 2005). Indeed, preferential recall of negative compared to positive material is one\nof the most robust findings in the depression literature (Mathews & MacLeod 2005, Matt et\nal. 1992, Williams et al. 1997). In a meta-analysis of studies assessing recall performance, Matt\nand colleagues found that people with major depression remembered 10% more negative words\nthan they did positive words. In contrast, nondepressed controls exhibited a memory bias for\npositive information in 20 of 25 studies. It should be noted, however, that memory biases are\nfound most consistently in free recall tasks, and may be restricted to explicit memory. Results\nof studies using recognition or implicit memory measures have been much less consistent. In\nhis review of the implicit memory literature, Watkins (2002) reported that, across studies, no\nbias is found in depressed participants when the encoding and/or the recall of the emotional\nmaterial depend purely on perceptual processing. For example, if depressed participants are\nasked to count the letters in emotional words at encoding and to complete word stems or word\nfragments at recall, no evidence of an implicit memory bias is obtained (Watkins et al. 2000).\nIf, however, participants are asked to rate the recency of their experience with the word or to\nimagine themselves ina scene involving the word at encoding, and are asked to freely associate\nto a cue word or to provide a word that fits a given definition, implicit memory biases are\nobtained more consistently. Encoding and recall in these latter studies require semantic instead\nof pure perceptual processing of the material. This suggests that depressive deficits are due in\nlarge part to differences in the elaboration of the emotional material.\n\nDepression is associated not only with enhanced recall of negative events, but also with the\nrecall of rather generic memories, despite instructions to recall specific events (i.c., overgeneral\nmemory; see Williams et al. 2007 for a review). On the autobiographical memory test (AMT),\ndepressed participants respond to positive and negative cues with memories that summarize a\ncategory of similar events. Importantly, this research has demonstrated that overgeneral\n\n\u2018memories are associated with difficulties in problem solving, with deficits in imagining specific\nfuture events, and with longer durations of depressive episodes (Raes et al. 2005). Moreover,\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.\n\n\n1duosnuepy Joyiny vd-Hi\n\nyduosnue Joyny Vd-HIN\n\n1duosnuely Jouiny Vd-HIN\n\narly for positive memories, predicted less\ncomplete recovery from major depression at a seven-month follow-up assessment. In contrast,\nBrewin etal. (1999) found that over-general recall of autobiographical memories did not predict\nrecovery from depression, although intrusive memories of life events did predict recovery.\nFurthermore, the extent to which individuals retrieve overgeneral memories predicted delayed\nrecovery from affective disorders (Dalgleish et al. 2001). Williams (1996) proposed that\novergeneral memory is a form of emotion regulation. That is, individuals attempt to minimize\nnegative affect attached to distressing memories by blocking access to details of such memories\nor by retrieving these memories in a less specific way. Williams et al. (2007) proposed further\nthat individual differences in cognitive control, and specifically in inhibitory dysfunction, may\nunderlie overgeneral recall in depression, a proposition that we examine more closely later in\nthis review. Thus, understanding overgeneral memory in the context of emotion regulation in\ndepression is an important goal for future research. In sum, negative biases in memory appear\nto characterize depressed individuals; in fact, depression is associated not only with increased\naccessibility of negative material, but also with the recall of overgeneral memories.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThere is consensus that anxious individuals favor negative interpretations of ambiguous stimuli\nand often do so in tasks that indicate that these biases operate on an automatic level (see\nMathews & MacLeod 2005 and Zinbarg & Yoon 2008 for reviews). For example, individuals\nwith panic disorder interpret descriptions of physical sensations as symptoms of catastrophic\ndisease (Clark 1988), and individuals diagnosed with social phobia overestimate both the\nlikelihood of negative social events and the negative consequences of these events (Foa et al.\n1996). Because earlier studies relied heavily on participants\u2019 self-reports of their\ninterpretations, their results may be confounded with response bias or demand issues (MacLeod\n& Cohen 1993). To overcome these limitations, researchers developed alternative techniques,\nmainly based on priming paradigms, to assess interpretive bias without asking participants to\nemit or endorse alternative response options. These more recent studies confirmed the presence\nof negative interpretive biases (e.g., MacLeod & Cohen 1993, Yoon & Zinbarg 2008) or the\nabsence of positive interpretive biases (e.g., Hirsch & Mathews 2000) in anxious participants.\n\n\nZ\ni\n0\n>\n>\n=\n=\n5\nI<]\nSs\n=\n[5]\n=\nc\n@\nf=]\n3.\n\u00a9\n23\n\nyduosnueiy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nyduosnueiy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nGotlib and Joormann\n\nPage 9\n\nPerception and Attention\n\nSome older studies, for example, investigated perceptual thresholds for tachistoscopically\npresented emotional and neutral words in depressed and nondepressed participants. Powell &\nHemsley (1984) used neutral words to individually calibrate presentation times for recognition\nthresholds and subsequently presented neutral and negative words at this threshold. The authors\nreported that depressed participants took longer than did controls to recognize neutral words\nbut did not differ in response times to negative words. Moreover, the depressed participants\nrecognized a higher ratio of negative to neutral words. Mogg et al. (1993) similarly used a\nmodified Stroop task and presented anxiety-related, depression-related, positive, and neutral\nwords either subliminally (followed by a mask) or supraliminally. In the emotion Stroop task,\nindividuals with anxiety disorders typically take longer to respond to threat words compared\nto neutral words, suggesting that their attention is \u201cgrabbed\u201d by the content of the threat words.\nWhereas anxious participants exhibited slower color naming of all negative words at both\nsubliminal and supraliminal exposure durations, depressed participants did not differ from\ncontrol participants in the subliminal condition (see also Lim & Kim 2005). Yovel & Mincka\n(2005) also failed to find a relation between Stroop biases for subliminally presented\ndepression-related words and self-reported depressive symptoms in a sample of undergraduate\nstudents. Importantly, using an emotion Stroop task, Bradley et al. (1995) found that only\npatients with GAD who were not comorbid with depression exhibited biased processing for\nnegative words; GAD patients who were also diagnosed with depression did not differ from\nthe control participants.\n\nSeveral investigators have used the visual-probe, or dot-probe, task with briefly presented and\nmasked emotional words to examine automatic processing biases in depression. In this task, a\npair of stimuli (words or faces) is presented simultaneously: One stimulus is neutral and the\nother is emotional. Participants are asked to respond to a probe that replaces either the neutral\nor the emotional stimulus. Allocation of attention to the spatial position of the stimulus is\ndetermined from response latencies to the probes. Here, too, the results have not been\nencouraging. Mathews et al. (1996) found evidence for biased processing in depressed patients\nonly when the stimuli were presented for relatively long exposure durations (permitting\nawareness of the stimuli). It is important to note, however, that Mathews et al. did not use\ndepression-relevant stimuli but instead used anxiety-relevant words. Mogg et al. (1995)\nsimilarly reported biased processing in the subliminal condition of a dot-probe task for\nparticipants diagnosed with an anxiety disorder but no bias for their depressed sample. Mogg\net al. used depression-relevant and anxiety-relevant words but did not find an effect of word\ncategory on the performance in the depression group. Finally, Bradley et al. (1997) reported\nthat whereas induced or naturally occurring sad mood was associated with increased attention\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.\n\n\n1duosnuep Jouiny vd-HIN duosnuep Jouyny vd-HIN\n\nyduosnueiy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nGotlib and Joormann\n\nPage 10\n\nto negative words at long exposure durations, there was no effect when the words were\npresented briefly and masked (see also Donaldson et al. 2007). One important difference\nbetween the depression and anxiety studies is that whereas studies of anxiety have used both\nwords and pictures, most of the subliminal Stroop and dot-probe studies in depression have\nused only words as stimuli. Few published dot-probe studies have examined biased processing\nof subliminally presented pictures or emotional faces in depressive disorders, and it remains\nto be seen whether these kinds of stimuli lead to different results.\n\nThe only exception to this general pattern of a lack of processing biases in depression when\nstimuli are presented subliminally is a handful of studies using lexical decision tasks, in which\nparticipants must decide whether a stimulus is a word. The lexical decision is preceded by the\npresentation of a subliminally presented prime. The few studies using this design in depression\nresearch have produced mixed results. Matthews & Southall (1991), for example, found a\npriming effect for neutral words, but not for positive or negative words, in depressed patients\nusing subliminal primes. In contrast, Bradley et al. (1994) used subliminal priming followed\nby a lexical decision task and found that nonclinical participants with high levels of self-\nreported negative affect showed greater subliminal priming of depression-relevant than of\nneutral words than did participants with low levels of negative affect. Moreover, the subliminal\npriming effect was more closely associated with level of depression than with level of anxiety.\nBradley et al. (1995, 1997) replicated this finding in separate samples of students who scored\nhigh on a measure of negative affect and of diagnosed depressed participants.\n\nFinally, some investigators have used a dichotic listening task to assess automatic processing\nof negative material in depression. Ingram et al. (1994), for example, found that remitted\ndepressed participants who were exposed to a negative mood induction made more shadowing\nerrors (indicating interference in processing the to-be-attended information) when negative or\npositive words were presented in the unattended channel; this effect was not found in\nparticipants who had no mood induction. McCabe & Gotlib (1993) combined the dichotic\nlistening task with a secondary task in which participants\u2019 response times to a light probe were\nassessed while they were engaged in the dichotic listening task. Depressed participants took\nlonger to respond to the light probe when negative words, compared to positive or neutral\nwords, were presented on the attended channel. Interestingly, this effect disappeared after\nremission from the depressive episode.\n\nResearchers have also examined the processing of facial expressions of emotion to investigate\nwhether depressed participants are prone to perceive sadness. Facial expressions of emotion\nare powerful stimuli that represent salient features of the social environment (Hansen & Hansen\n1994). Individuals use facial expressions to monitor emotional reactions of their interaction\npartners and adjust their behavior accordingly (Salovey & Mayer 1990). Misrcading facial\nexpressions, particularly when they are subtle, can have profound consequences for the\ninterpretation of a situation and can affect the selection and the effectiveness of emotion-\nregulation strategies such as reappraisal. Whereas some investigators have found that depressed\nindividuals are characterized by deficits in the processing of all (i.c., emotional and neutral)\nfacial expressions (c.g., Carton et al. 1999), other researchers have failed to replicate this\nfinding (e.g., Ridout ct al. 2003). Numerous investigators have found depression to be\nassociated with negative biases in the processing of specific types of emotional faces (Rubinow\n& Post 1992). All of these studies, however, have examined full-intensity facial expressions.\nThe question of whether depression is characterized by carly perception of emotional\nexpressions has been examined in studies using subtle expressions of emotion. These studies\nsuggest that depression is associated primarily with difficulties identifying subtle positive\nemotional expressions; depressed individuals do not more easily identify low-intensity sadness\n(Joormann & Gotlib 2006).\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.\n\n\n1duosnuep Jouiny vd-HIN duosnuep Jouyny vd-HIN\n\nyduosnueiy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nGotlib and Joormann\n\nPage 11\n\nTaken together, empirical findings that depression is associated with faster identification of\nmood-congruent material or a faster orienting toward negative stimuli are mixed. These results\nare in line with Williams et al. (1997), who proposed that depressed persons are not\ncharacterized by biases in early processing. Instead, these authors suggested that anxiety-\ncongruent biases are observed in tasks that assess the carly, orienting stage of processing, prior\nto awareness. In contrast, depressive biases are observed in strategic elaboration and make it\ndifficult for depressed people to disengage from negative material. Importantly, there is\nempirical evidence to support these predictions.\n\nIndividuals diagnosed with anxiety disorders have been found to attend to threat stimuli that\nare presented supraliminally (for reviews, see Bar-Haim et al. 2007, Mathews & MacLeod\n2005, Zinbarg & Yoon 2008). Most studies in this area of research have used either the modified\nStroop task or an attention allocation paradigm, such as the dot-probe task, but with longer-\nexposure durations of the emotional stimuli. Interestingly, again, numerous studies have failed\nto find similar biases in depression (c.g., Mogg et al. 1993). Most investigations using the\nStroop task do not find differences between depressed participants and controls, even if stimuli\nare presented supraliminally (e.g., Holmes & Pizzagalli 2008, Mogg et al. 1993). Bradley et\nal. (1995), for example, found that depression was not associated with increased Stroop\ninterference, and the well-replicated interference effect in anxiety was not present in GAD\npatients who had comorbid depression. Several investigators have used the dot-probe task with\nsupraliminal stimuli to investigate processing biases in depression. Here, too, results have not\nbeen encouraging (e.g., Mogg et al. 1995). Further, in a recent study using an attention task\nwith happy, sad, angry, and neutral faces at both long and short exposure durations, Koster et\nal. (2006) found no correlations with symptoms of depression or anxiety.\n\nIt may be premature, however, to conclude that depressed persons are not characterized by\nattentional biases in later stages of processing. Recent studies using the dot-probe task, for\nexample, have reported selective attention in depression, but only under conditions of long\nstimuli exposures. Bradley et al. (1997) reported a mood-congruent bias on the dot-probe task\nfor both induced and naturally occurring dysphoria when stimuli were presented for 500 or\n1000 ms, but not when they were presented for brief durations (14 ms). Using a dot-probe task\nwith emotional faces as stimuli, Gotlib et al. (2004) found an attentional bias for negative faces\nthat were presented for 1000 ms in clinically diagnosed depressed participants (sce also\nDonaldson et al. 2007). In two recent studies, Joormann & Gotlib (2007) and Joormann et al.\n(2007b) replicated these findings in samples of remitted depressed adults and nondisordered\ngirls at high risk for depression due to their mothers\u2019 psychopathology, respectively. These\nfindings suggest that attentional biases are not simply a symptom of depression or a scar of a\nprevious depressive episode, but may play an important role in the vulnerability to depression.\n\nOverall, these results indicate that depressed individuals do not direct their attention to negative\ninformation more frequently than do control participants, but once it captures their attention,\nthey exhibit difficulties disengaging from it. Similar difficulties in disengaging attention from\nnegative material have now been demonstrated using other attention tasks. Rinck & Becker\n(2005), for example, reported that depressed participants did not show enhanced detection of\ndepression-related words in a visual search task, but were more easily distracted by negative\nwords. Eizenman et al. (2003) used eye-tracking technology to continuously monitor point of\ngaze. Depressed individuals spent significantly more time looking at pictures featuring sadness\nand loss and had significantly longer average glance durations for these pictures than did\nnondepressed controls. Similarly, Caseras ct al. (2007) found in an eye-tracking study that\ndepressed individuals were no more likely than controls to shift their attention toward negative\nstimuli, but once their attention was focused on negative stimuli, they spent significantly more\ntime looking at these stimuli than did nondepressed controls.\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.\n\n\n1duosnuep Jouiny vd-HIN duosnuep Jouyny vd-HIN\n\nyduosnueiy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nGotlib and Joormann\n\nPage 12\n\nIn sum, these findings suggest that depression is characterized by a selective bias for negative\ninformation, but that the nature of this bias is different from that reported in anxiety disorders.\nDepressed individuals may not automatically orient their attention toward negative information\nin the environment, but once such information has come to be the focus of their attention, they\nmay have greater difficulty disengaging from it. Thus, depression appears to be characterized\nby problems with disengagement from negative stimuli. Considered together, these findings\nsuggest that depression is associated with a selective bias for negative information, but that\nthis bias does not operate throughout all aspects of attention.\n\nINHIBITION AND COGNITIVE CONTROL\n\nDifficulties disengaging attention from negative material may reflect deficits in inhibitory\ncontrol that are associated with depression. Overriding prepotent responses and inhibiting the\nprocessing of irrelevant material that captures attention are core abilities that allow us to\nrespond flexibly and to adjust our behavior and emotional responses to changing situations.\nCognitive control is related to the functioning of executive control processes, such as inhibition\nin WM (Hasher et al. 1999). WM is commonly described as a system for the active maintenance\nand manipulation of information and for the control of attention (Baddeley 1986). Itis a limited-\ncapacity system that provides temporary access to a select set of representations in the service\nof current cognitive processes (Cowan 1999). Thus, WM reflects the focus of attention and the\ntemporary activation of representations that are the content of awareness. Given the capacity\nlimitation of this system, it is important that the contents of WM be updated efficiently, a task\ncontrolled by executive processes (\u00a2.g., Friedman & Miyake 2004, Hasher et al. 1999).\nExecutive processes must selectively gate access to WM, shielding it from intrusion from\nirrelevant material, and must also discard information that is no longer relevant. In this context,\nindividual differences in the experience and resolution of interference are likely to affect\ncognitive and emotional functioning. The occurrence of intrusive thoughts might be one\nconsequence of poor interference resolution. Indeed, increased interference from irrelevant\nrepresentations has been proposed as a source of low WM capacity (Engle ct al. 1999) and has\nbeen found to characterize various populations, including older adults (Hasher et al. 1991),\nchildren with attention deficit disorder (Bjorklund & Harnishfeger 1990), patients with\nobsessive-compulsive disorder (Enright & Beech 1990), and patients with schizophrenia (Frith\n1979).\n\nSeveral researchers have suggested that depression is associated with deficits in executive\nfunctioning (Hertel 1997, Joormann 2005). Indeed, there is emerging evidence that depression\nis characterized by difficulties in the inhibition of mood-congruent material that could result\nin prolonged processing of negative, goal-irrelevant aspects of presented information and\nthereby hinder recovery from negative mood and lead to the sustained negative affect that\ncharacterizes depressive episodes. Theorists have suggested that deficits in cognitive inhibition\nlic at the heart of biases in memory and attention in depression and set the stage for ruminative\nresponses to negative events and negative mood states. A number of experimental paradigms\nhave been developed that have the potential to test inhibition models (c.g., Anderson & Bjork\n1994). Below we discuss several of these designs, such as negative priming (Tipper 1985) and\ndirected forgetting (Bjork 1972).\n\nCognitive inhibition of irrelevant information is crucial in a range of tasks that require selective\nattention. Negative priming is an experimental task that aims to distinguish activation from\ninhibition accounts of selective attention (Neill et al. 1995, Tipper 1985). In this task,\nparticipants are asked to respond to a target in the presence of a distractor. Participants can be\nasked, for example, to name a word written in red while ignoring a word written in blue that\nis presented at the same time. The negative priming effect is defined as a longer response\nlatency when the distractor from a previous trial becomes the target on the present trial. Thus,\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.\n\n\n1duosnuep Jouiny vd-HIN duosnuep Jouyny vd-HIN\n\nyduosnueiy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nGotlib and Joormann\n\nPage 13\n\nnegative priming occurs when, in the following trial, the presented target is identical or related\nto the previously presented to-be-ignored distractor. The inhibition of the distractor that is\nactivated on the first trial remains activated on the following trial, delaying the response to a\ntarget that is identical to or related to the ignored distractor. The delay in responding, therefore,\nassesses the strength of inhibition of the distractor that was presented on the previous trial.\n\nNegative priming has been observed in a variety of selective attention tasks, including\nsemantically related distractor-target pairs (c.g., a picture of a dog following an ignored picture\nof a cat; Tipper 1985). The area of rescarch in which negative priming has been used most\nwidely involves the identification of individual differences associated with the effect. Linville\n(1996) was the first to investigate negative priming in depression. She reported that depressed\nindividuals were less likely to inhibit distracting information than were nondepressed controls.\nSpecifically, participants were asked to complete a modified lexical decision task that required\nthem to inhibit the presence of a distractor (i.c., letter string) while identifying whether a second\nstring is a word. Whereas control participants were slower to respond to letter strings that they\nhad been asked to ignore on an carlier trial, depressed individuals failed to show this effect.\nSimilarly, MacQueen et al. (2000) used a negative priming task in which they systematically\nvaried color and location of prime and target, and reported reduced inhibition of distractors in\ndepressed participants. Although these results support the proposition that depression is related\nto inhibitory dysfunction, inhibitory deficits might be even more prevalent in the processing\nof emotional information. In particular, the observation of negative automatic thoughts and\nruminations about negative information in depression leads to the hypothesis that there is a\nvalence-specific inhibitory deficit in depression in which inhibition is selectively reduced for\nnegative stimuli.\n\nThe negative affective priming (NAP) task was designed to assess inhibition in the processing\nof emotional information (Joormann 2004). This task assesses response times to positive and\nnegative material that participants were instructed to ignore. Joormann (2004) found that\ndysphoric participants and participants with a history of depressive episodes exhibited reduced\ninhibition of negative material. Thus, these participants responded more quickly when a\nnegative target was presented after a to-be-ignored negative distractor on the previous trial. As\npredicted, no group differences were found for the positive adjectives. In a related study,\nparticipants who obtained high scores on a self-report measure of rumination exhibited a\nreduced ability to inhibit the processing of emotional distractors, a finding that remained\nsignificant even after controlling for level of depressive symptoms (Joormann 2006).\nImportantly, these findings were replicated using a negative priming task with emotional faces\n(Goeleven ct al. 2006). Compared to nondepressed controls, depressed participants showed\nimpaired inhibition of sad facial expressions but intact inhibition of happy expressions. Never-\ndepressed individuals exhibited a stronger NAP effect for both sad and happy faces compared\nto neutral faces, indicating successful inhibition of emotional information in general.\n\nNegative priming tasks assess only one aspect of inhibition: the ability to control the access of\nrelevant and irrelevant material to WM. Most contemporary theories postulate that inhibition\nis not a unitary construct, but instead involves several components such as response inhibition,\ncognitive inhibition, and emotional inhibition (c.g., Friedman & Miyake 2004, Nigg 2000). In\naddition, cognitive inhibition operates at different stages of the processing of information, for\nexample, by preventing off-goal information from having access to WM or by reducing the\nactivation of information that was once relevant, but now is irrelevant because of a change in\ngoals. Whereas results from NAP studies suggest that depression involves difficulties keeping\nirrelevant emotional information from entering WM, it is unclear whether depression is also\nassociated with difficulties removing previously relevant negative material from WM.\nDifficulties inhibiting the processing of negative material that was, but is no longer, relevant\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.\n\n\njduosnuepy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nyduosnueiy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nyduosnueiy Joyiny vd-HIN\n\nGotlib and Joormann\n\nPage 14\n\nmight explain why people respond to negative mood states and negative life events with\nrecurring, uncontrollable, and unintentional negative thoughts.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, Joormann & Gotlib (2008) used a modified Sternberg task that\ncombines a short-term recognition task with instructions to ignore a previously memorized list\nof words to assess inhibition of irrelevant positive and negative stimuli. In this task, two lists\nof emotional words are presented simultaneously. After the lists are memorized, a cue indicates\nwhich of the two lists is relevant for the recognition task on the next display, in which\nparticipants indicate whether the probe that is presented came from the relevant list; probes\nfrom the no-longer-relevant list must be rejected, as must new probes. The difference in reaction\ntimes to an intrusion probe (i.e., a probe from the irrelevant list) and reaction times to a new\nprobe (i.e., a completely new word) reflects the strength of the residual activation of the\ncontents of WM that were declared to be no longer relevant and, therefore, assesses a person\u2019s\nability to remove irrelevant information from WM (Oberauer 2005a,b). We found that\nparticipants diagnosed with MDD exhibited difficulties removing irrelevant negative material\nfrom WM. Specifically, compared to never-depressed controls, depressed individuals exhibited\nlonger decision latencies to an intrusion probe (i.e., a probe from the irrelevant list) than to a\nnew probe (i.c., a completely new word), reflecting the strength of the residual activation of\nthe contents of WM that were declared to be no longer relevant. Importantly, this pattern was\nnot found for positive material. Joormann & Gotlib (2008) also found that difficulty removing\nnegative irrelevant words from WM was highly correlated with self-reported rumination, even\nafter controlling for level of depressive symptoms.\n\nItis likely that deficits in cognitive control not only affect peoples ability to disengage attention\nfrom irrelevant material, thereby increasing unwanted thoughts, but also make it difficult for\nthem to intentionally forget unwanted material. As we described above, investigators have\nconsistently documented the operation of memory biases in depression. Theorists have\nsuggested that analogous processes underlie both selective retrieval of target items from\nmemory and selective attention to objects in the external environment (Anderson & Spellman\n1995). Consequently, if inhibitory dysfunction is found in depressed individuals on selective\nattention tasks, it may also be detectable on memory tasks. The postulation that depression is\nassociated with such deficits in executive control has been tested in directed-forgetting tasks\nin which participants are instructed to forget previously studied material at some point during\nthe experiment. Later recall is tested, however, for material that was to be remembered and\n\u2018material that was to be forgotten (Bjork 1972). In a study using neutral material, Cottencin et\nal. (2008) reported increased recall of to-be-forgotten words and decreased recall of to-be-\nremembered words in depression. Using positive and negative words, Power et al. (2000)\nreported differential directed-forgetting effects for depressed and nondepressed participants.\nSpecifically, the depressed participants exhibited a facilitation effect for negative words after\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol.

In contrast to directed\nforgetting studies, the authors provided multiple opportunities for the participants to practice\nthe active suppression of the items to examine whether forgetting would increase with\nsuppression training. Importantly, depressed participants could be trained to forget negative\n\u2018words, suggesting intriguing implications of this research for interventions (see also Joormann\netal. 2009\u00a2).\n\nCOGNITIVE BIASES AND EMOTION REGULATION IN DEPRESSION\n\nSustained negative affect is a core feature of depression. It is likely that there are a number of\nfactors that affect people\u2019s ability to recover from negative affect in this disorder, including\nknowledge of effective strategies and motivation to implement them (Campbell-Sills & Barlow\n2007). Biases in the processing of emotional material, however, may be particularly detrimental\nfor people\u2019s ability to regulate negative emotional states. Indeed, cognition plays a critical role\nin human emotion. According to cognitive theories of emotion, cognitive appraisals determine\n\u2018whether an emotion is experienced and, if it is, which emotion is experienced. Thus, cognition\nis the primary route through which emotions are regulated. Biases and deficits in cognitive\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol.

Other cognitive processes, however, do not\nchange emotional responding directly, but instead affect the case with which individuals can\nutilize emotion-regulation strategies. Individual differences in cognitive control, for example,\ncan influence a person\u2019s ability to reappraise events. Biases in attention and memory, in\nparticular, may lead to inflexible and automatic appraisals that make it difficult to use deliberate\nreappraisals of situations to regulate emotions (Siemer & Reisenzein 2007). Indeed, such biases\ncan lead persons to use regulatory strategies that are maladaptive. For example, implicit\nmemory for details of a traumatic event may lead an individual to select or avoid a specific\nsituation, even though that situation may not be as aversive or elicit the degree of negative\naffect as was expected. Given that these processes do not affect emotion directly, cognitive\nflexibility and cognitive biases are not traditionally considered emotion-regulation strategies.\nNevertheless, it is important to examine their role in emotion regulation because they can affect\nthe selection and the effectiveness of various regulation strategies.\n\noreover, recent studies suggest that\nimpaired emotion regulation is not only a characteristic of individuals who are currently\ndepressed, but also can be evident following recovery from this disorder (c.g, Ehring ct al.\n2008).\n\nAs we note above, depression is associated with difficulties disengaging attention from\nnegative material, with deficits in inhibitory control, and with biases in memory. All of these\nanomalies have the potential to affect the use and effectiveness of emotion-regulation\nstrategies, as well as the efficacy of more-automatic regulation processes. The ability to ignore\nsituational cues that elicit an emotion or to quickly disengage from these cues may play an\nimportant role in preventing the onset of emotions and in regulating emotional responses. Thus,\ndifficulties in disengaging attention are likely to hinder people\u2019s use of attentional redirection\nor deployment as an emotion-regulation strategy. This in turn increases the probability that\ncertain appraisals will follow. Given depressed people\u2019s difficulties in disengaging from\nnegative material, their ability to use attentional deployment as a regulatory strategy is likely\nto be impaired. Indeed, some studies have provided evidence for an association between\nattentional biases and mood changes in response to exposure to a stressor. Compton et al.\n(2000), for example, demonstrated that a reduced ability to disengage attention was associated\nwith increased reactivity to a distressing film clip. Individual differences in orienting, however,\nwere not found to be related to the mood response. Similarly, Ellenbogen et al. (2002) reported\nthat people undergoing a stressful task were faster to shift attention away from negative material\nand that these attentional shifts were associated with more negative mood in response to the\nstressor. In a related study, these authors showed that the ability to disengage from\nsupraliminally presented dysphoric pictures was associated with less change in negative mood\nratings in response to a subsequent stress task but did not affect neuroendocrine responding.\nIn contrast, rapid disengagement from masked threat pictures affected neuroendocrine\nresponding to the stressor but not mood (Ellenbogen et al. 2006).

Thus, an inability to appropriately expel mood-\ncongruent items from WM as they become irrelevant would lead to difficulties attending to\nand processing new information and might also result in rumination and the use of other mal-\nadaptive emotion-regulation strategies. Difficulties inhibiting salient but irrelevant thoughts\nand memories would also discourage the use of more effective emotion-regulation strategies,\nsuch as reappraisal.\n\nAs we outline above, deficits in inhibitory processes may also play a central role in the\noccurrence of ruminative responses. According to Nolen-Hoeksema and her colleagues,\nrumination is a particularly detrimental response to negative affect that hinders recovery from\nnegative mood and prolongs depressive episodes (Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 2008). What\ncharacterizes rumination and differentiates it from negative automatic thoughts is that it is a\nstyle of thought rather than just negative content (Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 2008). Thus,\nrumination is defined by the process of recurring thoughts and ideas (often described as a\nrecycling of thoughts) and not necessarily by the content of the thoughts. In an extensive\nprogram of experimental and correlational studies, Nolen-Hoeksema and colleagues\ninvestigated rumination in depression and dysphoria and examined how this response style\nexacerbates sad moods and predicts future depressive episodes (e.g., Morrow & Nolen-\nHoeskema 1990). Self-reported levels of rumination have been found to predict higher levels\nof dysphoria in prospective studies with nonclinical samples, even after controlling for initial\ndifferential depression levels (e.g., Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow 1991). Moreover, studies have\nshown that rumination predicts higher levels of depressive symptoms and onset of major\ndepressive episodes and mediates the gender difference in depressive symptoms (Nolen-\nHoeksema 2000, Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 2007). Research also indicates that rumination\nenhances the operation of cognitive biases. Thus, dysphoric participants who were induced to\nruminate endorsed more negative interpretations of hypothetical situations, generated less-\neffective problem-solving strategies (Lyubomirsky & Nolen-Hoeksema 1995), and exhibited\nincreased recall of negative autobiographical memories (Lyubomirsky et al. 1998). Similarly,\nSinger & Dobson (2007) found that remitted depressed patients who were instructed to\nruminate during a negative mood induction had higher levels of depressed mood than did\nparticipants who were instructed to use distraction.\n\nTREATMENT IMPLICATIONS\n\nIn this final section of this review, we describe what we believe are exciting developments in\nresearch examining clinical interventions that build on the findings discussed above. Recent\nstudies examining the effectiveness of modifying cognitive biases have demonstrated that\ntraining biases and improving cognitive control reduces other symptoms of emotional\ndisorders. For example, training highly anxious people to disengage their attention from threat\n\u2018material has been found to lead to changes in mood and reduced reactivity to stressful events.\nIn a typical training paradigm, the dot probe is presented more frequently in the location of the\nnonthreat-relevant stimuli (rather than equally following threat and nonthreat stimuli) so that\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol.

Using this approach, MacLeod et al. (2002) first\nestablished that attentional biases could be modified by working with participants who scored\nin the middle third of the distribution on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger\netal. 1971). They found that after attentional training away from the threat, participants\nreported reduced negative affect to a standardized stress manipulation. In a subsequent study,\nMathews & MacLeod (2002) established that the attentional training was effective in reducing\nanxiety in high-STAI scorers one month before a school examination. More recently,\nWadlinger & Isaacowitz (2008) extended MacLeod and colleagues\u2019 (2002) findings by\ndemonstrating that positive attentional biases can also be trained. Moreover, participants who\nhad been trained to attend to positive stimuli subsequently looked less at negative images during\nastress induction. On the basis of these findings, researchers have begun to examine attentional\ntraining with clinical samples; thus far, however, no studies have examined whether modifying\ncognitive biases in depressed participants leads to improved emotion regulation.\n\nResearchers have also begun to modify interpretive biases in anxiety with the goal of improving\nadaptive emotional responding. Mathews & Mackintosh (2000), for example, used ambiguous\nscenarios to train individuals to make either positive (nonanxious) or negative (anxious)\ninterpretations of ambiguous text. These authors found that participants in the negative training\ncondition exhibited higher levels of anxiety following the training than did participants in the\npositive training condition, suggesting that interpretive biases play a causal role in affecting\nanxiety levels. Yiend et al. (2005) demonstrated that the effects of interpretive training on\nanxiety were still present after a 24-hour delay between the training and a subsequent test. In\na related study, participants who received interpretive training using ambiguous homophones\nwere subsequently presented four distressing television clips of real-life emergency rescue\n\nz\n! \u00a3\nz\n2\ng\nI=]\nES\n8\n: 8\n3\n5\nk=\n\n>\n&\nEl\nB\ng\nEH\nH\ng\n8\n8\ng\nB\n5\n8\n=\ng\n2\nE\nM\na\ng\n2\n&\n\u00a3\n8\n2\n2\nES\ng\n=\ng\ng\n8\n2\n&\n2\n=\nLE\nE\n&\nEl\nEd\nES\nBH\n\u00a3\n8\n3\n8\nE\n\ndepression affects emotional responding.

Indeed, recent work by this group indicates that\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn sum, depression is characterized by a specific pattern of biased processing of emotional\n\u2018material that includes increased elaboration of negative information, difficulties disengaging\nfrom negative material, and deficits in cognitive control when processing negative material.\nIn this review, we discussed how these biases may be linked to emotion dysregulation in\ndepression and, thereby, to sustained negative affect, the core feature of depressive episodes.\nBecause the experience of negative mood states and negative life events is associated with the\nactivation of mood-congruent cognitions in WM, the ability to control the contents of WM is\nlikely to be critical in differentiating people who recover easily from negative affect from those\nwho initiate a vicious cycle of increasingly negative ruminative thinking and deepening sad\n\u2018mood. Interventions focused on directly modifying cognitive biases and on increasing\ncognitive control hold considerable promise for improving the effectiveness of the treatment\nof depression.\n\nClearly, studies are needed that examine more explicitly and systematically the mechanisms\nthat underlie depressive cognition and the role of cognition in the regulation of emotion. In this\ncontext, investigations integrating biological and psychological aspects of depression will be\nparticularly important in increasing our understanding of the relation between cognitive\ndysfunction and depression. For example, a growing literature is beginning to elucidate the\nneural circuitry of emotions (e.g., Ochsner & Gross 2008) and, in particular, the brain structures\nimplicated in depression (Cooney et al. 2007, Gotlib & Hamilton 2008). These studies have\ndocumented the involvement of the limbic system, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and\nparts of the anterior cingulate cortex in the experience of both emotional states and depression,\nas well as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the regulation of emotion. Interestingly,\nJohnstone et al. (2007) reported that during reappraisal of emotional pictures, nondepressed\nindividuals, but not their depressed counterparts, were characterized by increased dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex activation and decreased amygdala activation that appeared to be mediated\nby the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, suggesting depression-associated difficulties in\nrecruiting brain regions involved in the cognitive control of emotions. Similarly, given the\nimportance of inhibitory functioning in depression, Eugene et al. (2009) presented study results\nthat underscore the importance of assessing activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex\nas depressed individuals attempt to inhibit the processing of negative stimuli, and Johnson et\nal. (2009) found reduced activation in medial frontal cortex in depressed participants during\nambiguous self-referential processing. Although these findings are exciting and provide\nevidence that documents associations among inhibition, reappraisal, rmination, and emotion\nregulation in depression, more studies are clearly needed to increase our understanding of the\nbrain regions and neural circuits involved in cognitive inhibition and executive functioning in\ndepression.\n\n\u2018The recent surge in studies of specific genes that may be implicated in depression is also\nbecoming increasingly relevant to the study of cognitive functioning in this disorder. Several\nstudies have now linked the short allele of a functional 5' promoter polymorphism of the\n\nserotonin transporter gene (S-HTTLPR) to the onset of depression, particularly in the context\n\nAnnu Rev Clin Psychol.

Investigators have now begun to\nexamine associations of S-HTTLPR with cognitive biases in depression. Beevers ct al.\n(2007), for example, reported a link between S-HTTLPR and attentional bias on the dot-probe\ntask in psychiatric inpatients; Hayden et al. (2008) similarly found 5-HTTLPR to be associated\nwith biased recall on a self-referent encoding task in girls at risk for depression. Such\ninvestigations that integrate the examination of patterns of neural activation, genetics, and\ncognitive processing hold great promise to help us gain a more comprehensive understanding\nof how psychological and biological factors interact to affect the onset, maintenance, and\ncourse of depression.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nAm.
