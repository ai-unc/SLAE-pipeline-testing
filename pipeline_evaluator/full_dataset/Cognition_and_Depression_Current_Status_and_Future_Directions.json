Gotlib: ian.gotlib@stanford.edu1 Department of Psychology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305-21302 Department of Psychology, University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida 33124AbstractCognitive theories of depression posit that people\u2019s thoughts, inferences, attitudes, andinterpretations, and the way in which they attend to and recall information, can increase their riskfor depression. Three mechanisms have been implicated in the relation between biased cognitiveprocessing and the dysregulation of emotion in depression: inhibitory processes and deficits inworking memory, ruminative responses to negative mood states and negative life events, and theinability to use positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood. In this review, we presenta contemporary characterization of depressive cognition and discuss how different cognitiveprocesses are related not only to each other, but also to emotion dysregulation, the hallmark featureof depression. We conclude that depression is characterized by increased elaboration of negativeinformation, by difficulties disengaging from negative material, and by deficits in cognitive controlwhen processing negative information. We discuss treatment implications of these conclusions andargue that the study of cognitive aspects of depression must be broadened by investigating neuraland genetic factors that are related to cognitive dysfunction in this disorder. Such integrativeinvestigations should help us gain a more comprehensive understanding of how cognitive andbiological factors interact to affect the onset, maintenance, and course of depression.Keywordsdepression; cognition; information-processing biasesINTRODUCTIONDepression not only changes the way we feel, it also changes how we perceive ourselves andthe world around us. There is a long history of research investigating the interaction of cognitionand emotion in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Clinicians and researchers alike havefocused on cognitive processes and on the content of depressive cognition in trying to gain amore comprehensive understanding of MDD. Negative views of the self, the world, and thefuture, as well as recurrent and uncontrollable negative thoughts that often revolve around theself, are debilitating symptoms of depression. Moreover, biases in cognitive processes such asattention and memory may not only be correlates of depressive episodes; they may also playa critical role in increasing individuals\u2019 vulnerability for the first onset and recurrence ofdepression.DISCLOSURE STATEMENTThe authors are not aware of any affiliations, memberships, funding, or financial holdings that might be perceived as affecting theobjectivity of this review.NIH Public AccessAuthor ManuscriptAnnu Rev Clin Psychol .

Indeed, most cognitive theoriespropose vulnerability-stress hypotheses that posit that the onset of this disorder is due to theinteraction of a psychological vulnerability (e.g., certain cognitions or particular ways ofprocessing information) and a precipitating stressor (e.g., a negative life event or some otherenvironmental factor). Importantly, one of the most effective interventions for depression,cognitive-behavioral therapy, focuses on modifying biased interpretations and dysfunctionalautomatic thoughts (Beck 1976) and proposes that changes in cognition will lead toimprovement of other symptoms of the disorder, including sustained negative affect andanhedonia. Consequently, the primary goal of a large body of research has been to gain a morecomprehensive understanding of difficulties in cognitive functioning that can result in theemotion dysregulation and sustained negative affect that are central to depression. A betterunderstanding of the nature and role of depressive cognition promises to help advance theoriesof depression and improve treatments for this disorder.More than three decades of research on cognitive factors in depression have providedimpressive support for many aspects of cognitive formulations of depression. Early studiesfocused primarily on demonstrating that depressed and nondepressed people differ in thecontent of their thoughts. Recent investigations, however, have started to explore the nature ofthe cognitive deficits and biases in the processing of information that characterize depression.Whereas earlier studies used a variety of self-report measures, studies on cognitive biases haveutilized a wide variety of experimental tasks. These investigations have generally providedsupport for the formulation that depression is characterized by negative automatic thoughtsand biases in attention, interpretation, and memory (Mathews & MacLeod 2005).Despite the early promise of cognitive theories of depression, important questions remain. Theproposition that both depression and anxiety are characterized by biases in all aspects ofinformation processing, for example, has received little support. A closer comparison of studiesthat have provided evidence for depression-related biases with studies that have not can leadto a more comprehensive characterization of cognitive processing in depression that could haveimportant implications for models of, and interventions for, depression. Moreover, whereasnumerous studies have provided evidence that cognitive biases are present during currentepisodes of depression, empirical support for the presence of these biases outside of currentepisodes is more elusive. And even fewer investigators have tested explicitly the diathesis-stress model of depression by, for example, assessing biased processing prior to the first onsetof depression to examine whether it predicts depression following the experience of a negativelife event. Finally, there has been little connection between cognitive theories of depressionand other aspects of depressive functioning. Few studies have examined how deficits in recall,attentional biases for negative material, and mood-congruent memory are related to each otherand, more importantly, how they are related to the hallmark feature of depression\u2014sustainednegative affect. Given this critical shortcoming, it is imperative that researchers attempt tounderstand the nature of the relation between difficulties or deficits in the processing ofinformation and the dysregulation of emotion that is central to depressive disorders. As wedescribe in detail below, three important mechanisms have been implicated as potential linksbetween biased attentional/memory processes and emotion dysregulation in depression: biasedinhibitory processes and deficits in working memory (Joormann 2005); ruminative responsesto negative mood states and negative life events ( Nolen-Hoeksema 2000 ); and the inability touse positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood (Joormann & Siemer 2004,Joormann et al. 2007a).In this review, we examine the literature on cognitive biases in depression to provide acontemporary characterization of depressive cognition. We discuss how the different biasesGotlib and Joormann Page 2Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptidentified in studies in this area may be related not only to each other, but also to emotiondysregulation, the hallmark feature of depression. We then briefly present treatmentimplications of the conclusions gleaned from these examinations. Finally, in closing, weunderscore the position that the study of cognitive aspects of depression must be broadened byadopting a more integrative perspective on the processing of emotional stimuli in this disorder.In particular, we highlight the importance of investigating neural aspects of emotion regulationand of responsivity to emotional stimuli in understanding MDD. We begin with a briefoverview of the symptoms and prevalence of depression and then turn to a discussion ofcognitive theories of this disorder.DEPRESSION: CLINICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL INFORMATIONMDD is characterized by a constellation of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive symptoms,including psychomotor agitation or retardation, marked weight loss, insomnia or hyper-somnia,decreased appetite, fatigue, extreme feelings of guilt or worthlessness, concentrationdifficulties, and suicidal ideation. To meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders  (DSM-IV-TR; Am. Psychiatr. Assoc. 2000) criteria for a diagnosis of MDD, a setof these symptoms has to be present for the same two-week period. Although all of thesesymptoms are, therefore, important in diagnosing MDD, depression is primarily a disorder ofemotion dysregulation and sustained negative affect. Indeed, a diagnosis of depression requiresthe presence of either sustained negative affect or loss of pleasure. We should also note,however, that depression is a term that is often used imprecisely, ranging from thecharacterization of depressive disorders diagnosed according to DSM criteria, to thecharacterization of a temporary mood state in otherwise healthy individuals. Moreover,researchers frequently use the terms \u201cdepression\u201d and \u201cdysphoria\u201d interchangeably: dysphoriais commonly referred to as a form of subclinical depression defined by specific cut-off scoreson measures assessing self-reported depressive symptomatology. It is important to be cognizantof these distinctions when reviewing the depression literature; in this review, we focusprimarily on studies that examined participants diagnosed as depressed according to DSMcriteria. Because few researchers have compared dysphoria and depression directly, it is stillan open question whether results obtained with dysphoric samples generalize to clinicallydepressed participants.Depression is among the most prevalent of all psychiatric disorders. Recent estimates indicatethat almost 20% of the American population, or more than 30 million adults, will experiencea clinically significant episode of depression at some point in their lives (Kessler & Wang2009). In fact, the rates of depression are so high that the World Health Organization GlobalBurden of Disease Study ranked depression as the single most burdensome disease in the worldin terms of total disability-adjusted years among people in the middle years of life ( Murray &Lopez 1996). Depression is frequently comorbid with other mental and physical difficulties,most often with anxiety disorders, but also with cardiac problems and smoking (e.g., Carney& Freedland 2009). Finally, there are significant economic and social costs of depression.Kessler et al. (2006), for example, estimated that the annual salary-equivalent costs ofdepression-related lost productivity in the United States exceed $36 billion. There is alsomounting evidence that depression adversely affects the quality of interpersonal relationshipsand, in particular, relationships with spouses and children. Not only is the rate of divorce higheramong depressed than among nondepressed individuals (e.g., Wade & Cairney 2000), butchildren of depressed parents have also been found to be at elevated risk for psychopathology(Joorman et al. 2008).Importantly, depression is a highly recurrent disorder. More than 75% of depressed patientshave more than one depressive episode, often relapsing within two years of recovery from adepressive episode (Boland & Keller 2009). Indeed, between one-half and two-thirds of peopleGotlib and Joormann Page 3Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptwho have ever been clinically depressed will be in an episode in any given year over theremainder of their lives (Kessler & Wang 2009). This high recurrence rate in depressionsuggests that there are specific factors that increase people\u2019s risk for developing repeatedepisodes of this disorder. In this review, we focus on one such factor: cognitive functioningand cognitive biases in the processing of emotional information.COGNITIVE THEORIES OF DEPRESSIONCognitive theories of depression were first formulated about 40 years ago. Even though thesetheories have provided the impetus for an extraordinarily productive program of researchattempting to provide empirical evidence for their main propositions, this research has not ledto substantive changes in cognitive models of this disorder. Beck (1976) postulated that existingmemory representations, or schemas, lead individuals to filter stimuli from the environmentsuch that their attention is directed toward information that is congruent with their schemas.Beck theorized that the schemas of depressed persons include themes of loss, separation,failure, worthlessness, and rejection; consequently, depressed individuals will exhibit asystematic bias in their processing of environmental stimuli or information that is relevant tothese themes. Because of this bias, depressed people attend selectively to negative stimuli intheir environment and interpret neutral and ambiguous stimuli in a schema-congruent way.Moreover, dysfunctional schemas and processing biases are presumed to endure beyond thedepressive episode, representing stable vulnerability factors for depression onset andrecurrence. When the dysfunctional schemas are activated by stressors, specific negativecognitions are generated that take the form of automatic thoughts and revolve aroundpessimistic views about the self, the world, and the future\u2014the cognitive triad. In more recentversions of this model, Beck differentiated between schemas that involve social relationships(sociotropy) and schemas that concern achievement (autonomy; Epstein et al. 1983). Finally,Beck\u2019s cognitive specificity hypothesis posits that these schemas are likely to be activated bycongruent life events, thereby initiating a vicious cycle of negative automatic thoughts,processing biases, and depressed mood.Research examining processing biases in depression was inspired primarily by Bower\u2019s(1981) work on mood and memory. These studies postulate that \u201cassociative networks\u201d leadto cognitive biases in depressed individuals. These associative networks consist of numerousnodes, each containing specific semantic representations that can be activated byenvironmental stimuli. The activation of any one node causes the partial activation, or priming,of all the other nodes within its associative network through a process of spreading activation.Consequently, the representations of the primed nodes require less activation for access tooccur than do the representations of nonprimed nodes, resulting in a processing advantage forstimuli that are related to these primed representations. Like Beck, Bower also postulates thatassociative networks are stable constructs; the attentional biases of depressed individuals areexpected to endure beyond the depressive episode. Indeed, Ingram (1984) and Teasdale(1988) both have drawn on Bower\u2019s theory in explaining the onset, maintenance, andrecurrence of depressive disorders. Importantly, virtually all cognitive theories predict thatdepression is characterized by biased processing of emotional material. We review theempirical evidence for this proposition below. First, however, we want to briefly discuss theimportant question of whether depression is associated specifically with biases in theprocessing of emotional material, or instead is characterized by a more general cognitive deficitthat affects the processing of both emotional and nonemotional material.COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN DEPRESSIONTwo distinct patterns of cognitive correlates of depression and dysphoria are frequently cited.First, depressed people report experiencing broad difficulties involving concentration andGotlib and Joormann Page 4Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptmemory (Burt et al. 1995 ). Second, despite these difficulties, they report easily concentratingon negative self-focused thoughts, and they exhibit enhanced recall of mood-congruent (i.e.,negatively valenced) material (Mathews & MacLeod 2005). General deficits in cognitivefunctioning that are associated with depression, such as concentration difficulties,distractibility, and impairments in memory, have typically been studied separately fromcognitive biases, i.e., preferential processing of negative material. Few attempts have beenmade to integrate findings obtained in these separate lines of research.One noteworthy exception is the resource-allocation hypothesis that postulates that becausetheir cognitive capacity is reduced, depressed individuals have deficits in remembering and inengaging in other effortful cognitive processes (e.g., Ellis & Ashbrook 1988). The generalassumptions are that the amount of resources available for cognitive operations is limited andthat depression either occupies or functionally reduces these resources, for example, becauseresources are used by task-irrelevant emotional processing. Thus, deficits should becomeevident in effortful tasks; they should be detectable in effortful, resource-demandingcomponents of memory tasks, for example, but not in automatic aspects of these tasks.Similarly, the affective interference hypothesis posits that because depressed persons arepreoccupied with the processing of emotional material, their performance on tasks that requirethem to process emotional aspects of stimuli will be fine, but will suffer on tasks that requirethem to ignore emotional aspects of the stimuli and respond to other aspects of the material(Siegle et al. 2002). For example, if depressed individuals are required to make valencejudgments about words, their tendency to prioritize the processing of emotional material willaid them. If, however, they are instructed to ignore the emotional content of words whilemaking a lexical decision judgment, their processing priorities will interfere with this demandand their performance will be impaired.Depressed people often complain of concentration difficulties (Watts & Sharrock 1985);indeed, \u201cdifficulty concentrating\u201d is a symptom of a major depressive episode in DSM-IV. Inaddition, there is a large literature that strongly suggests that depressed individuals arecharacterized by memory impairments (see Burt et al. 1995, Mathews & MacLeod 2005). Inthe frequently cited meta-analysis by Burt et al. (1995), memory impairments were reportedmore consistently for inpatients than for outpatients. Moreover, and not surprisingly, memoryimpairments were also reported in other psychological disorders. Burt et al. proposed,therefore, that memory deficits are associated with psychopathology in general rather than withdepression specifically. Furthermore, in a series of studies, Hertel and collaborators (e.g.,Hertel 1998, Hertel & Rude 1991) presented evidence indicating that depression-relatedimpairments are not observed in all components of memory, but are found primarily in freerecall tasks and in controlled aspects of recognition.Overall, studies conducted thus far provide evidence that depression is associated with greatermemory impairment in contexts in which ( a) attention is not constrained by the task (e.g.,Hertel & Rude 1991); ( b) increased cognitive effort is required (see review by Hartlage et al.1993); and ( c) attention is easily allocated to personal concerns and other thoughts that areirrelevant to the task (Ellis & Ashbrook 1988). Importantly, Hertel & Rude (1991) were ableto eliminate a depressive deficit by providing instructions that focused participants on the taskand did not allow task irrelevant thoughts. Hertel (1998) also found comparable deficits inrecall between dysphoric students who had to wait in an unconstrained situation (without beinggiven any instructions regarding what to do during the waiting period) and dysphoric studentswho were instructed to rate self-focused material designed to induce rumination. In contrast,no deficit was found for dysphoric students who were instructed what to do during the waitingperiod (rating self-irrelevant and task-irrelevant material).Gotlib and Joormann Page 5Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptThese results suggest that, at least with respect to memory deficits, depressed people mighthave the ability to perform at the level of nondepressed people in structured situations but haveproblems doing this on their own initiative in unconstrained situations (Hertel 2004). Moreover,these results suggest that eliminating the opportunity to ruminate also eliminated theimpairment in the memory task, a result that might explain why unconstrained tasks lead toimpaired performance in the depressed group. Unconstrained situations call for cognitiveflexibility and goal-oriented behavior and require cognitive control, that is, focal attention torelevant stimuli as well as inhibition of irrelevant material (Hertel 2004). Thus, theseperformance deficits in the recall of neutral information do not seem to reflect a generalizeddeficit or a lack of resources on the part of depressed individuals, but might be due instead todepression-related inhibitory difficulties in the processing of irrelevant information.Other studies have investigated depression-related deficits in tasks that assess variouscomponents of working memory (WM). Channon et al. (1993), for example, found fewdifferences between depressed and nondepressed participants on a variety of WM tasks (i.e.,only on the backward digit span; see also Barch et al. 2003). Most of the tasks that are used toassess WM (e.g., the digit span) involve relatively short retention intervals and, thus, seem toallow a more direct assessment of attentional processes irrespective of retrieval from long-termmemory. These tasks have been criticized, however, because the relatively slow presentationsthat are used to ensure perception might allow for chunking and active rehearsal of materialand, therefore, might reflect memory deficits rather than deficits in attention (Rokke et al.2002). Using an attentional blink paradigm that involves rapid serial presentations, Rokke etal. found significant group differences in performance between moderately to severelydysphoric (Beck Depression Inventory scores over 21) and nondysphoric participants, but onlyunder demanding dual-tasking conditions. It is important to note, however, that only ninemoderately to severely dysphoric participants were included in this study, so these findingsshould be interpreted with caution.Rose & Ebmeier (2006) reported that depressed patients were slower and less accurate thanwere controls on an n-back task, but that task difficulty did not influence this effect. Thesefindings replicate results reported by Harvey et al. (2004), who found further that theperformance deficit on the n-back task was correlated with number of hospitalizations and withthe longitudinal course of the disorder. Importantly, Harvey et al. did not find depression-associated differences on a number of other tasks assessing WM functioning, including a digitspan. Consistent with these findings, Egeland et al. (2003)  concluded from the results of theirstudy that reduced performance on WM tasks in depression is due not to a specific deficit inexecutive functioning, but to a nonspecific reduction in speed and to a loss of vigilance that isconsistent with a lack of effort. Grant et al. (2001) administered a battery of cognitive tasks to123 depressed outpatients and noted the surprising absence of cognitive deficits in their sample.The only indications of deficits were fewer completed categories, increased perseveration, andimpaired maintenance of set on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), a widely usedmeasure of executive control and cognitive flexibility. These results suggest the operation ofdepression-related deficits in the generation and maintenance of problem-solving strategiesand difficulties in set switching (see also Harvey et al. 2004). Importantly, though, there wasno evidence of deficits in executive functioning on any of the other tasks administered in thisstudy. Grant et al. concluded that pervasive cognitive deficits most likely characterize elderlydepressed people and severely depressed inpatients who present with psychotic features (seeHarvey et al. 2004 and Rose & Ebmeier 2006 for similar conclusions). In a recent review paper,Castaneda et al. (2008) concluded that deficits in certain aspects of executive control andattentional deficits most likely characterize depressed people whereas evidence for learningand memory deficits is more mixed. They also pointed out, however, that there is significantvariability in the extent to which studies report deficits and that this variability is due to thesubtype of depression (with deficits being most prominent in psychotic depression) and to theGotlib and Joormann Page 6Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptage of the participants (with deficits being most prominent in older depressed adults). It is alsoimportant to keep in mind that it can be difficult to differentiate between cognitive deficits anda lack of motivation that often characterizes depressed patients (Scheurich et al. 2008).In sum, surprisingly little empirical support has been found to date for pervasive depressivedeficits in general cognitive functioning. Indeed, the bulk of evidence points to depression-associated deficits in the control of attention rather than to limited processing capacity. Whendepressed participants\u2019 attention is well controlled by the demands of the task and they haveno opportunity to ruminate, no depressive deficits are found. Focusing attention requiresindividuals to inhibit task-irrelevant thoughts. Thus, the findings reviewed here support theaffective interference hypothesis and the proposition that depressed individuals arecharacterized by reduced cognitive control. These results also suggest that examining howdepressed individuals process emotional information may help us gain a better understandingof their difficulties in the processing of neutral material.BIASED PROCESSING OF EMOTIONAL INFORMATION IN DEPRESSIONCognitive models of depression posit that depressed individuals exhibit cognitive biases in allaspects of information processing, including memory, interpretation, and perception andattention (Mathews & MacLeod 2005). While these theoretical predictions are straightforward,the empirical results are not. For example, a current controversial question concerningcognitive theories of emotional disorders is whether there are, in fact, negative biases inmemory, interpretation, and attention in depression.MemoryOverall, there is strong evidence for biased memory processes in depression (Mathews &MacLeod 2005). Indeed, preferential recall of negative compared to positive material is oneof the most robust findings in the depression literature (Mathews & MacLeod 2005, Matt etal. 1992, Williams et al. 1997). In a meta-analysis of studies assessing recall performance, Mattand colleagues found that people with major depression remembered 10% more negative wordsthan they did positive words. In contrast, nondepressed controls exhibited a memory bias forpositive information in 20 of 25 studies. It should be noted, however, that memory biases arefound most consistently in free recall tasks, and may be restricted to explicit memory. Resultsof studies using recognition or implicit memory measures have been much less consistent. Inhis review of the implicit memory literature, Watkins (2002) reported that, across studies, nobias is found in depressed participants when the encoding and/or the recall of the emotionalmaterial depend purely on perceptual processing. For example, if depressed participants areasked to count the letters in emotional words at encoding and to complete word stems or wordfragments at recall, no evidence of an implicit memory bias is obtained (Watkins et al. 2000 ).If, however, participants are asked to rate the recency of their experience with the word or toimagine themselves in a scene involving the word at encoding, and are asked to freely associateto a cue word or to provide a word that fits a given definition, implicit memory biases areobtained more consistently. Encoding and recall in these latter studies require semantic insteadof pure perceptual processing of the material. This suggests that depressive deficits are due inlarge part to differences in the elaboration of the emotional material.Depression is associated not only with enhanced recall of negative events, but also with therecall of rather generic memories, despite instructions to recall specific events (i.e., overgeneralmemory; see Williams et al. 2007 for a review). On the autobiographical memory test (AMT),depressed participants respond to positive and negative cues with memories that summarize acategory of similar events. Importantly, this research has demonstrated that overgeneralmemories are associated with difficulties in problem solving, with deficits in imagining specificfuture events, and with longer durations of depressive episodes (Raes et al. 2005). Moreover,Gotlib and Joormann Page 7Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptovergeneral memories remain stable outside of episodes of the disorder and have been shownto predict later onset of depressive episodes in postpartum depression (Mackinger et al.2000), and to predict depression following life events in students and following unsuccessfulin vitro fertilization (van Minnen et al. 2005 ). Brittlebank et al. (1993) found that overgeneralrecall of autobiographical memories, particularly for positive memories, predicted lesscomplete recovery from major depression at a seven-month follow-up assessment. In contrast,Brewin et al. (1999) found that over-general recall of autobiographical memories did not predictrecovery from depression, although intrusive memories of life events did predict recovery.Furthermore, the extent to which individuals retrieve overgeneral memories predicted delayedrecovery from affective disorders (Dalgleish et al. 2001). Williams (1996) proposed thatovergeneral memory is a form of emotion regulation. That is, individuals attempt to minimizenegative affect attached to distressing memories by blocking access to details of such memoriesor by retrieving these memories in a less specific way. Williams et al. (2007) proposed furtherthat individual differences in cognitive control, and specifically in inhibitory dysfunction, mayunderlie overgeneral recall in depression, a proposition that we examine more closely later inthis review. Thus, understanding overgeneral memory in the context of emotion regulation indepression is an important goal for future research. In sum, negative biases in memory appearto characterize depressed individuals; in fact, depression is associated not only with increasedaccessibility of negative material, but also with the recall of overgeneral memories.InterpretationThere is consensus that anxious individuals favor negative interpretations of ambiguous stimuliand often do so in tasks that indicate that these biases operate on an automatic level (seeMathews & MacLeod 2005 and Zinbarg & Yoon 2008 for reviews). For example, individualswith panic disorder interpret descriptions of physical sensations as symptoms of catastrophicdisease (Clark 1988), and individuals diagnosed with social phobia overestimate both thelikelihood of negative social events and the negative consequences of these events (Foa et al.1996). Because earlier studies relied heavily on participants\u2019 self-reports of theirinterpretations, their results may be confounded with response bias or demand issues ( MacLeod& Cohen 1993). To overcome these limitations, researchers developed alternative techniques,mainly based on priming paradigms, to assess interpretive bias without asking participants toemit or endorse alternative response options. These more recent studies confirmed the presenceof negative interpretive biases (e.g., MacLeod & Cohen 1993, Yoon & Zinbarg 2008) or theabsence of positive interpretive biases (e.g., Hirsch & Mathews 2000) in anxious participants.Results have been much more equivocal regarding whether depression is characterized bysimilar automatic biases in interpretation. Butler & Mathews (1983), for example, presentedclinically depressed participants with ambiguous scenarios and found that, compared tonondepressed participants, depressed individuals ranked negative interpretations higher thanthey did other possible interpretations. In a study assessing biases using participants\u2019 latenciesto respond to target words that were presented after ambiguous sentences, Lawson & MacLeod(1999) found no interpretation bias in depressed individuals. Using a similar task, Bisson &Sears (2007) also failed to find evidence of an interpretive bias in depression even after anegative mood induction. Lawson et al. (2002) examined the magnitude of the startle responseduring imagery elicited by emotionally ambiguous text in depressed and non-depressedparticipants. Using this procedure, Lawson et al. found evidence of more negativeinterpretations in their depressed than in their nondepressed samples and concluded that thefailure to find a bias in previous studies was due to the use of response latencies as the dependentvariable. Rude et al. (2002) found that a measure of interpretation bias, the ScrambledSentences Test, predicted increases in depressive symptoms after 4\u20136 weeks in a large sampleof undergraduate students, especially when administered under cognitive load. Finally, Dearing& Gotlib (2009) recently reported a negative interpretation bias in never-disordered daughtersGotlib and Joormann Page 8Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptof depressed mothers, providing evidence for a role of these biases in increasing risk for theonset of depression. Clearly, further studies are needed that carefully and systematicallyinvestigate interpretive biases in depression.Perception and AttentionThe question of whether depression is associated with enhanced and, perhaps, automaticperception of emotion-relevant cues has been investigated in studies using subliminal material,material with low degrees of emotional intensity, and fast presentation times. Studies have useddisorder-specific material or material that is relevant to emotion across disorders, such as facialexpressions of emotion. Numerous investigations using a number of different tasks haveprovided evidence in anxiety disorders for biased processing of subliminally presented anxiety-provoking stimuli (e.g., Bradley et al. 1995, Mathews et al. 1996). Strikingly, few studies todate have found similar biases in clinically depressed participants, even when depression-relevant stimuli have been masked in order to investigate unconscious processing (see Mathews& MacLeod 2005 for a recent review of this literature).Some older studies, for example, investigated perceptual thresholds for tachistoscopicallypresented emotional and neutral words in depressed and nondepressed participants. Powell &Hemsley (1984) used neutral words to individually calibrate presentation times for recognitionthresholds and subsequently presented neutral and negative words at this threshold. The authorsreported that depressed participants took longer than did controls to recognize neutral wordsbut did not differ in response times to negative words. Moreover, the depressed participantsrecognized a higher ratio of negative to neutral words. Mogg et al. (1993) similarly used amodified Stroop task and presented anxiety-related, depression-related, positive, and neutralwords either subliminally (followed by a mask) or supraliminally. In the emotion Stroop task,individuals with anxiety disorders typically take longer to respond to threat words comparedto neutral words, suggesting that their attention is \u201cgrabbed\u201d by the content of the threat words.Whereas anxious participants exhibited slower color naming of all negative words at bothsubliminal and supraliminal exposure durations, depressed participants did not differ fromcontrol participants in the subliminal condition (see also Lim & Kim 2005). Yovel & Mineka(2005) also failed to find a relation between Stroop biases for subliminally presenteddepression-related words and self-reported depressive symptoms in a sample of undergraduatestudents. Importantly, using an emotion Stroop task, Bradley et al. (1995) found that onlypatients with GAD who were not comorbid with depression exhibited biased processing fornegative words; GAD patients who were also diagnosed with depression did not differ fromthe control participants.Several investigators have used the visual-probe, or dot-probe, task with briefly presented andmasked emotional words to examine automatic processing biases in depression. In this task, apair of stimuli (words or faces) is presented simultaneously: One stimulus is neutral and theother is emotional. Participants are asked to respond to a probe that replaces either the neutralor the emotional stimulus. Allocation of attention to the spatial position of the stimulus isdetermined from response latencies to the probes. Here, too, the results have not beenencouraging. Mathews et al. (1996) found evidence for biased processing in depressed patientsonly when the stimuli were presented for relatively long exposure durations (permittingawareness of the stimuli). It is important to note, however, that Mathews et al. did not usedepression-relevant stimuli but instead used anxiety-relevant words. Mogg et al. (1995)similarly reported biased processing in the subliminal condition of a dot-probe task forparticipants diagnosed with an anxiety disorder but no bias for their depressed sample. Mogget al. used depression-relevant and anxiety-relevant words but did not find an effect of wordcategory on the performance in the depression group. Finally, Bradley et al. (1997) reportedthat whereas induced or naturally occurring sad mood was associated with increased attentionGotlib and Joormann Page 9Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptto negative words at long exposure durations, there was no effect when the words werepresented briefly and masked (see also Donaldson et al. 2007). One important differencebetween the depression and anxiety studies is that whereas studies of anxiety have used bothwords and pictures, most of the subliminal Stroop and dot-probe studies in depression haveused only words as stimuli. Few published dot-probe studies have examined biased processingof subliminally presented pictures or emotional faces in depressive disorders, and it remainsto be seen whether these kinds of stimuli lead to different results.The only exception to this general pattern of a lack of processing biases in depression whenstimuli are presented subliminally is a handful of studies using lexical decision tasks, in whichparticipants must decide whether a stimulus is a word. The lexical decision is preceded by thepresentation of a subliminally presented prime. The few studies using this design in depressionresearch have produced mixed results. Matthews & Southall (1991), for example, found apriming effect for neutral words, but not for positive or negative words, in depressed patientsusing subliminal primes. In contrast, Bradley et al. (1994) used subliminal priming followedby a lexical decision task and found that nonclinical participants with high levels of self-reported negative affect showed greater subliminal priming of depression-relevant than ofneutral words than did participants with low levels of negative affect. Moreover, the subliminalpriming effect was more closely associated with level of depression than with level of anxiety.Bradley et al. (1995, 1997)  replicated this finding in separate samples of students who scoredhigh on a measure of negative affect and of diagnosed depressed participants.Finally, some investigators have used a dichotic listening task to assess automatic processingof negative material in depression. Ingram et al. (1994), for example, found that remitteddepressed participants who were exposed to a negative mood induction made more shadowingerrors (indicating interference in processing the to-be-attended information) when negative orpositive words were presented in the unattended channel; this effect was not found inparticipants who had no mood induction. McCabe & Gotlib (1993) combined the dichoticlistening task with a secondary task in which participants\u2019 response times to a light probe wereassessed while they were engaged in the dichotic listening task. Depressed participants tooklonger to respond to the light probe when negative words, compared to positive or neutralwords, were presented on the attended channel. Interestingly, this effect disappeared afterremission from the depressive episode.Researchers have also examined the processing of facial expressions of emotion to investigatewhether depressed participants are prone to perceive sadness. Facial expressions of emotionare powerful stimuli that represent salient features of the social environment (Hansen & Hansen1994). Individuals use facial expressions to monitor emotional reactions of their interactionpartners and adjust their behavior accordingly (Salovey & Mayer 1990). Misreading facialexpressions, particularly when they are subtle, can have profound consequences for theinterpretation of a situation and can affect the selection and the effectiveness of emotion-regulation strategies such as reappraisal. Whereas some investigators have found that depressedindividuals are characterized by deficits in the processing of all (i.e., emotional and neutral)facial expressions (e.g., Carton et al. 1999), other researchers have failed to replicate thisfinding (e.g., Ridout et al. 2003). Numerous investigators have found depression to beassociated with negative biases in the processing of specific types of emotional faces ( Rubinow& Post 1992). All of these studies, however, have examined full-intensity facial expressions.The question of whether depression is characterized by early perception of emotionalexpressions has been examined in studies using subtle expressions of emotion. These studiessuggest that depression is associated primarily with difficulties identifying subtle positiveemotional expressions; depressed individuals do not more easily identify low-intensity sadness(Joormann & Gotlib 2006).Gotlib and Joormann Page 10Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptTaken together, empirical findings that depression is associated with faster identification ofmood-congruent material or a faster orienting toward negative stimuli are mixed. These resultsare in line with Williams et al. (1997), who proposed that depressed persons are notcharacterized by biases in early processing. Instead, these authors suggested that anxiety-congruent biases are observed in tasks that assess the early, orienting stage of processing, priorto awareness. In contrast, depressive biases are observed in strategic elaboration and make itdifficult for depressed people to disengage from negative material. Importantly, there isempirical evidence to support these predictions.Individuals diagnosed with anxiety disorders have been found to attend to threat stimuli thatare presented supraliminally (for reviews, see Bar-Haim et al. 2007, Mathews & MacLeod2005 , Zinbarg & Yoon 2008). Most studies in this area of research have used either the modifiedStroop task or an attention allocation paradigm, such as the dot-probe task, but with longer-exposure durations of the emotional stimuli. Interestingly, again, numerous studies have failedto find similar biases in depression (e.g., Mogg et al. 1993). Most investigations using theStroop task do not find differences between depressed participants and controls, even if stimuliare presented supraliminally (e.g., Holmes & Pizzagalli 2008, Mogg et al. 1993). Bradley etal. (1995), for example, found that depression was not associated with increased Stroopinterference, and the well-replicated interference effect in anxiety was not present in GADpatients who had comorbid depression. Several investigators have used the dot-probe task withsupraliminal stimuli to investigate processing biases in depression. Here, too, results have notbeen encouraging (e.g., Mogg et al. 1995). Further, in a recent study using an attention taskwith happy, sad, angry, and neutral faces at both long and short exposure durations, Koster etal. (2006) found no correlations with symptoms of depression or anxiety.It may be premature, however, to conclude that depressed persons are not characterized byattentional biases in later stages of processing. Recent studies using the dot-probe task, forexample, have reported selective attention in depression, but only under conditions of longstimuli exposures. Bradley et al. (1997) reported a mood-congruent bias on the dot-probe taskfor both induced and naturally occurring dysphoria when stimuli were presented for 500 or1000 ms, but not when they were presented for brief durations (14 ms). Using a dot-probe taskwith emotional faces as stimuli, Gotlib et al. (2004) found an attentional bias for negative facesthat were presented for 1000 ms in clinically diagnosed depressed participants (see alsoDonaldson et al. 2007). In two recent studies, Joormann & Gotlib (2007) and Joormann et al.(2007b) replicated these findings in samples of remitted depressed adults and nondisorderedgirls at high risk for depression due to their mothers\u2019 psychopathology, respectively. Thesefindings suggest that attentional biases are not simply a symptom of depression or a scar of aprevious depressive episode, but may play an important role in the vulnerability to depression.Overall, these results indicate that depressed individuals do not direct their attention to negativeinformation more frequently than do control participants, but once it captures their attention,they exhibit difficulties disengaging from it. Similar difficulties in disengaging attention fromnegative material have now been demonstrated using other attention tasks. Rinck & Becker(2005), for example, reported that depressed participants did not show enhanced detection ofdepression-related words in a visual search task, but were more easily distracted by negativewords. Eizenman et al. (2003)  used eye-tracking technology to continuously monitor point ofgaze. Depressed individuals spent significantly more time looking at pictures featuring sadnessand loss and had significantly longer average glance durations for these pictures than didnondepressed controls. Similarly, Caseras et al. (2007) found in an eye-tracking study thatdepressed individuals were no more likely than controls to shift their attention toward negativestimuli, but once their attention was focused on negative stimuli, they spent significantly moretime looking at these stimuli than did nondepressed controls.Gotlib and Joormann Page 11Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptIn sum, these findings suggest that depression is characterized by a selective bias for negativeinformation, but that the nature of this bias is different from that reported in anxiety disorders.Depressed individuals may not automatically orient their attention toward negative informationin the environment, but once such information has come to be the focus of their attention, theymay have greater difficulty disengaging from it. Thus, depression appears to be characterizedby problems with disengagement from negative stimuli. Considered together, these findingssuggest that depression is associated with a selective bias for negative information, but thatthis bias does not operate throughout all aspects of attention.INHIBITION AND COGNITIVE CONTROLDifficulties disengaging attention from negative material may reflect deficits in inhibitorycontrol that are associated with depression. Overriding prepotent responses and inhibiting theprocessing of irrelevant material that captures attention are core abilities that allow us torespond flexibly and to adjust our behavior and emotional responses to changing situations.Cognitive control is related to the functioning of executive control processes, such as inhibitionin WM (Hasher et al. 1999). WM is commonly described as a system for the active maintenanceand manipulation of information and for the control of attention ( Baddeley 1986 ). It is a limited-capacity system that provides temporary access to a select set of representations in the serviceof current cognitive processes (Cowan 1999). Thus, WM reflects the focus of attention and thetemporary activation of representations that are the content of awareness. Given the capacitylimitation of this system, it is important that the contents of WM be updated efficiently, a taskcontrolled by executive processes (e.g., Friedman & Miyake 2004, Hasher et al. 1999).Executive processes must selectively gate access to WM, shielding it from intrusion fromirrelevant material, and must also discard information that is no longer relevant. In this context,individual differences in the experience and resolution of interference are likely to affectcognitive and emotional functioning. The occurrence of intrusive thoughts might be oneconsequence of poor interference resolution. Indeed, increased interference from irrelevantrepresentations has been proposed as a source of low WM capacity (Engle et al. 1999) and hasbeen found to characterize various populations, including older adults (Hasher et al. 1991),children with attention deficit disorder (Bjorklund & Harnishfeger 1990), patients withobsessive-compulsive disorder (Enright & Beech 1990), and patients with schizophrenia ( Frith1979).Several researchers have suggested that depression is associated with deficits in executivefunctioning (Hertel 1997, Joormann 2005). Indeed, there is emerging evidence that depressionis characterized by difficulties in the inhibition of mood-congruent material that could resultin prolonged processing of negative, goal-irrelevant aspects of presented information andthereby hinder recovery from negative mood and lead to the sustained negative affect thatcharacterizes depressive episodes. Theorists have suggested that deficits in cognitive inhibitionlie at the heart of biases in memory and attention in depression and set the stage for ruminativeresponses to negative events and negative mood states. A number of experimental paradigmshave been developed that have the potential to test inhibition models (e.g., Anderson & Bjork1994 ). Below we discuss several of these designs, such as negative priming (Tipper 1985) anddirected forgetting (Bjork 1972).Cognitive inhibition of irrelevant information is crucial in a range of tasks that require selectiveattention. Negative priming is an experimental task that aims to distinguish activation frominhibition accounts of selective attention (Neill et al. 1995, Tipper 1985). In this task,participants are asked to respond to a target in the presence of a distractor. Participants can beasked, for example, to name a word written in red while ignoring a word written in blue thatis presented at the same time. The negative priming effect is defined as a longer responselatency when the distractor from a previous trial becomes the target on the present trial. Thus,Gotlib and Joormann Page 12Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptnegative priming occurs when, in the following trial, the presented target is identical or relatedto the previously presented to-be-ignored distractor. The inhibition of the distractor that isactivated on the first trial remains activated on the following trial, delaying the response to atarget that is identical to or related to the ignored distractor. The delay in responding, therefore,assesses the strength of inhibition of the distractor that was presented on the previous trial.Negative priming has been observed in a variety of selective attention tasks, includingsemantically related distractor-target pairs (e.g., a picture of a dog following an ignored pictureof a cat; Tipper 1985). The area of research in which negative priming has been used mostwidely involves the identification of individual differences associated with the effect. Linville(1996)  was the first to investigate negative priming in depression. She reported that depressedindividuals were less likely to inhibit distracting information than were nondepressed controls.Specifically, participants were asked to complete a modified lexical decision task that requiredthem to inhibit the presence of a distractor (i.e., letter string) while identifying whether a secondstring is a word. Whereas control participants were slower to respond to letter strings that theyhad been asked to ignore on an earlier trial, depressed individuals failed to show this effect.Similarly, MacQueen et al. (2000) used a negative priming task in which they systematicallyvaried color and location of prime and target, and reported reduced inhibition of distractors indepressed participants. Although these results support the proposition that depression is relatedto inhibitory dysfunction, inhibitory deficits might be even more prevalent in the processingof emotional information. In particular, the observation of negative automatic thoughts andruminations about negative information in depression leads to the hypothesis that there is avalence-specific inhibitory deficit in depression in which inhibition is selectively reduced fornegative stimuli.The negative affective priming (NAP) task was designed to assess inhibition in the processingof emotional information (Joormann 2004). This task assesses response times to positive andnegative material that participants were instructed to ignore. Joormann (2004) found thatdysphoric participants and participants with a history of depressive episodes exhibited reducedinhibition of negative material. Thus, these participants responded more quickly when anegative target was presented after a to-be-ignored negative distractor on the previous trial. Aspredicted, no group differences were found for the positive adjectives. In a related study,participants who obtained high scores on a self-report measure of rumination exhibited areduced ability to inhibit the processing of emotional distractors, a finding that remainedsignificant even after controlling for level of depressive symptoms (Joormann 2006).Importantly, these findings were replicated using a negative priming task with emotional faces(Goeleven et al. 2006). Compared to nondepressed controls, depressed participants showedimpaired inhibition of sad facial expressions but intact inhibition of happy expressions. Never-depressed individuals exhibited a stronger NAP effect for both sad and happy faces comparedto neutral faces, indicating successful inhibition of emotional information in general.Negative priming tasks assess only one aspect of inhibition: the ability to control the access ofrelevant and irrelevant material to WM. Most contemporary theories postulate that inhibitionis not a unitary construct, but instead involves several components such as response inhibition,cognitive inhibition, and emotional inhibition (e.g., Friedman & Miyake 2004 , Nigg 2000). Inaddition, cognitive inhibition operates at different stages of the processing of information, forexample, by preventing off-goal information from having access to WM or by reducing theactivation of information that was once relevant, but now is irrelevant because of a change ingoals. Whereas results from NAP studies suggest that depression involves difficulties keepingirrelevant emotional information from entering WM, it is unclear whether depression is alsoassociated with difficulties removing previously relevant negative material from WM.Difficulties inhibiting the processing of negative material that was, but is no longer, relevantGotlib and Joormann Page 13Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptmight explain why people respond to negative mood states and negative life events withrecurring, uncontrollable, and unintentional negative thoughts.To test this hypothesis, Joormann & Gotlib (2008) used a modified Sternberg task thatcombines a short-term recognition task with instructions to ignore a previously memorized listof words to assess inhibition of irrelevant positive and negative stimuli. In this task, two listsof emotional words are presented simultaneously. After the lists are memorized, a cue indicateswhich of the two lists is relevant for the recognition task on the next display, in whichparticipants indicate whether the probe that is presented came from the relevant list; probesfrom the no-longer-relevant list must be rejected, as must new probes. The difference in reactiontimes to an intrusion probe (i.e., a probe from the irrelevant list) and reaction times to a newprobe (i.e., a completely new word) reflects the strength of the residual activation of thecontents of WM that were declared to be no longer relevant and, therefore, assesses a person\u2019sability to remove irrelevant information from WM (Oberauer 2005a,b). We found thatparticipants diagnosed with MDD exhibited difficulties removing irrelevant negative materialfrom WM. Specifically, compared to never-depressed controls, depressed individuals exhibitedlonger decision latencies to an intrusion probe (i.e., a probe from the irrelevant list) than to anew probe (i.e., a completely new word), reflecting the strength of the residual activation ofthe contents of WM that were declared to be no longer relevant. Importantly, this pattern wasnot found for positive material. Joormann & Gotlib (2008) also found that difficulty removingnegative irrelevant words from WM was highly correlated with self-reported rumination, evenafter controlling for level of depressive symptoms.In sum, therefore, these findings indicate that depression is associated with inhibitoryimpairments in the processing of emotional material, specifically, with difficulties removingirrelevant negative material from WM. We recently replicated these findings using a taskdeveloped by Nee & Jonides (2008) that allows us to assess two aspects of inhibition withinthe same task: access of information to WM and discarding irrelevant material from WM.Interestingly, in this task, depressed participants did not differ from nondepressed controls intheir ability to keep irrelevant negative material from entering WM. We did, however, obtaina group difference in the ability to discard negative material from WM; no group differenceswere obtained in the processing of positive or neutral material. Difficulties discarding negativematerial in the depressed group were also correlated with self-reported rumination. Finally,using a task that requires participants to resort material in WM, Joormann et al. (2009b)demonstrated that MDD participants had difficulties manipulating negative material in WM,and that this deficit was associated with self-reported proneness to rumination.It is likely that deficits in cognitive control not only affect people\u2019s ability to disengage attentionfrom irrelevant material, thereby increasing unwanted thoughts, but also make it difficult forthem to intentionally forget unwanted material. As we described above, investigators haveconsistently documented the operation of memory biases in depression. Theorists havesuggested that analogous processes underlie both selective retrieval of target items frommemory and selective attention to objects in the external environment (Anderson & Spellman1995). Consequently, if inhibitory dysfunction is found in depressed individuals on selectiveattention tasks, it may also be detectable on memory tasks. The postulation that depression isassociated with such deficits in executive control has been tested in directed-forgetting tasksin which participants are instructed to forget previously studied material at some point duringthe experiment. Later recall is tested, however, for material that was to be remembered andmaterial that was to be forgotten (Bjork 1972). In a study using neutral material, Cottencin etal. (2008) reported increased recall of to-be-forgotten words and decreased recall of to-be-remembered words in depression. Using positive and negative words, Power et al. (2000)reported differential directed-forgetting effects for depressed and nondepressed participants.Specifically, the depressed participants exhibited a facilitation effect for negative words afterGotlib and Joormann Page 14Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptthe \u201cforget\u201d instruction. It is important to note that the effect was only found when the adjectiveswere processed in a self-relevant manner. Similar findings were obtained by Joormann & Tran(2009), who demonstrated that participants who scored high on a trait measure of ruminationexhibited reduced forgetting of negative material in this task. These participants also exhibitedincreased recall of negative words that were not presented during the learning phase. Theseresults remained stable when depression scores were included as a covariate. Interestingly, arecent study reported that depressed participants were more likely to falsely recall negativematerial that had never been presented during the learning trials (Joormann et al. 2009c).Hertel & Gerstle (2003) reported additional evidence for reduced inhibition of negative wordsin dysphoric students. These authors used a paradigm that was originally proposed by Anderson& Green (2001) . Dysphoric and nondysphoric students learned word pairs, each consisting ofa positive or negative adjective and a neutral noun. In subsequent practice trials, participantspracticed either recalling the target word or suppressing (i.e., making an active effort not tothink about) the target word when given the adjective as a cue. On the final test, recall for allwords was tested. Hertel & Gerstle (2003) found that recall from sets assigned for suppressionpractice was greater in the group of dysphoric participants, with a tendency toward increasedrecall of to-be-suppressed negative words. Moreover, the degree of forgetting was significantlycorrelated with self-report measures of rumination and unwanted thoughts. Again, these resultssuggest a close relation between self-reported rumination and inhibitory difficulties. Using aslightly modified version of the Anderson & Green (2001) task in which participants wereinstructed to remember or forget positive and negative nouns, Joormann et al. (2005)investigated intentional forgetting of positive and negative adjectives that depressed andcontrol participants had learned to associate with neutral nouns. In contrast to directedforgetting studies, the authors provided multiple opportunities for the participants to practicethe active suppression of the items to examine whether forgetting would increase withsuppression training. Importantly, depressed participants could be trained to forget negativewords, suggesting intriguing implications of this research for interventions (see also Joormannet al. 2009e).In sum, the literature reviewed above does not indicate that depression is associated with biasesin all aspects of information processing; rather, it suggests a very specific difference betweendepressed and nondepressed individuals in cognitive functioning. Depression is not necessarilycharacterized by a general cognitive deficit or by a high level of alertness in the processing ofnegative material. Instead, whereas anxiety disorders are associated with quick detection ofand fast orienting toward threat-related stimuli, results of studies investigating the automaticprocessing of negative material in depression are equivocal. Once negative material hasbecome the focus of attention, however, depressed individuals are prone to elaborate on it andhave difficulty stopping or inhibiting the processing of this material. This specific difficulty islikely to have important consequences for depressed people\u2019s ability to recover from negativeaffect and, consequently, may represent an important link between cognition and emotiondysregulation in this disorder.COGNITIVE BIASES AND EMOTION REGULATION IN DEPRESSIONSustained negative affect is a core feature of depression. It is likely that there are a number offactors that affect people\u2019s ability to recover from negative affect in this disorder, includingknowledge of effective strategies and motivation to implement them (Campbell-Sills & Barlow2007 ). Biases in the processing of emotional material, however, may be particularly detrimentalfor people\u2019s ability to regulate negative emotional states. Indeed, cognition plays a critical rolein human emotion. According to cognitive theories of emotion, cognitive appraisals determinewhether an emotion is experienced and, if it is, which emotion is experienced. Thus, cognitionis the primary route through which emotions are regulated. Biases and deficits in cognitiveGotlib and Joormann Page 15Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptfunctioning, therefore, are posited to affect people\u2019s ability to regulate emotion and moodstates, potentially increasing their vulnerability to develop emotional disorders (Joormann etal. 2009d).Individual differences in cognitive functioning may affect emotion regulation in various ways.For example, the ability to reinterpret emotion-eliciting situations and to quickly disengageattention can directly affect emotional experience. Other cognitive processes, however, do notchange emotional responding directly, but instead affect the ease with which individuals canutilize emotion-regulation strategies. Individual differences in cognitive control, for example,can influence a person\u2019s ability to reappraise events. Biases in attention and memory, inparticular, may lead to inflexible and automatic appraisals that make it difficult to use deliberatereappraisals of situations to regulate emotions (Siemer & Reisenzein 2007). Indeed, such biasescan lead persons to use regulatory strategies that are maladaptive. For example, implicitmemory for details of a traumatic event may lead an individual to select or avoid a specificsituation, even though that situation may not be as aversive or elicit the degree of negativeaffect as was expected. Given that these processes do not affect emotion directly, cognitiveflexibility and cognitive biases are not traditionally considered emotion-regulation strategies.Nevertheless, it is important to examine their role in emotion regulation because they can affectthe selection and the effectiveness of various regulation strategies.Surprisingly few studies have examined emotion-regulation strategies in depression.Moreover, most of these investigations have relied on self-report data and have studiedindividuals who score high on depression inventories rather than samples of diagnoseddepressed persons. Still, the findings of these studies support the formulation that the more-frequent use of certain strategies (e.g., emotion suppression, rumination, catastrophizing) andless-frequent use of other strategies (e.g., reappraisal, self-disclosure) are related to symptomsof depression and anxiety (Garnefski & Kraaij 2007). Moreover, recent studies suggest thatimpaired emotion regulation is not only a characteristic of individuals who are currentlydepressed, but also can be evident following recovery from this disorder (e.g., Ehring et al.2008).As we note above, depression is associated with difficulties disengaging attention fromnegative material, with deficits in inhibitory control, and with biases in memory. All of theseanomalies have the potential to affect the use and effectiveness of emotion-regulationstrategies, as well as the efficacy of more-automatic regulation processes. The ability to ignoresituational cues that elicit an emotion or to quickly disengage from these cues may play animportant role in preventing the onset of emotions and in regulating emotional responses. Thus,difficulties in disengaging attention are likely to hinder people\u2019s use of attentional redirectionor deployment as an emotion-regulation strategy. This in turn increases the probability thatcertain appraisals will follow. Given depressed people\u2019s difficulties in disengaging fromnegative material, their ability to use attentional deployment as a regulatory strategy is likelyto be impaired. Indeed, some studies have provided evidence for an association betweenattentional biases and mood changes in response to exposure to a stressor. Compton et al.(2000) , for example, demonstrated that a reduced ability to disengage attention was associatedwith increased reactivity to a distressing film clip. Individual differences in orienting, however,were not found to be related to the mood response. Similarly, Ellenbogen et al. (2002)  reportedthat people undergoing a stressful task were faster to shift attention away from negative materialand that these attentional shifts were associated with more negative mood in response to thestressor. In a related study, these authors showed that the ability to disengage fromsupraliminally presented dysphoric pictures was associated with less change in negative moodratings in response to a subsequent stress task but did not affect neuroendocrine responding.In contrast, rapid disengagement from masked threat pictures affected neuroendocrineresponding to the stressor but not mood (Ellenbogen et al. 2006). Beevers & Carver (2003)Gotlib and Joormann Page 16Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptdemonstrated that changes in attentional bias for negative but not positive words following anegative mood induction interacted with life stress to predict onset of depressive symptoms incollege students, and MacLeod & Hagan (1992) found that women who displayed the mostpronounced bias toward negative information later reported the greatest amount of distressupon learning that they had been diagnosed with cervical cancer. Thus, there is evidence boththat depression is characterized by difficulties disengaging from negative material and thatdifficulties in disengagement are related to impaired emotion regulation.Biases in memory may also affect emotion regulation in important ways. For example, memorybiases may influence people\u2019s perception of a specific situation, change their appraisals, andguide their attention toward specific aspects of that situation. In particular, biased recall canhave significant consequences if it depends on implicit memory. Implicit memory for stimulithat were present during a traumatic event may, for example, lead to unintentional selection(or avoidance) of specific situations and to the appraisal of relatively harmless situations aslife threatening, as frequently observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (McNally 1997). Theaccessibility of information in memory may affect emotional responses and interfere with theselection and use of effective emotion-regulation strategies. Moreover, memories themselvescan be potent in regulating emotions. For example, recent studies have demonstrated thatmemories of unpleasant events fade more quickly than do memories of pleasant events andthat this differential fading is associated with happiness (Walker et al. 2003). Further, recallingpositive autobiographical memories can repair an induced negative mood state (Joormann &Siemer 2004), and remembering positive events and forgetting negative events has been foundto be associated with increased well-being over the lifespan (Charles et al. 2003). Thus,selective recall not only can affect other emotion-regulation strategies (e.g., situation attentionor selection), it is also an effective strategy for directly changing emotions and mood states.Indeed, investigators have documented that mood-incongruent recall is often used as a mood-repair strategy in response to a negative mood induction (e.g., Rusting & DeHart 2000).Studies investigating the use and effectiveness of mood-regulation strategies in depressionsuggest that, in contrast to non-depressed persons, depressed individuals are unable to usepositive autobiographical memories to regulate induced negative mood states. In two studies,we examined the formulation that dysphoria and rumination are critical factors in determiningthe occurrence of mood-congruent memory retrieval as opposed to mood-repair processes(Joormann & Siemer 2004). Although nondysphoric participants\u2019 mood ratings improvedunder distraction as well as under mood-incongruent recall instructions, dysphoric participantsdid not benefit from the recall of positive memories, whereas distraction seemed to alleviatetheir sad mood. In a recent investigation, we replicated these findings in a sample of currentlydepressed participants. Interestingly, previously depressed participants exhibited similardifficulties in repairing their negative mood with positive memories (Joormann et al. 2007a).Overall, the results are largely consistent with the literature on mood regulation (Rusting &DeHart 2000) and support the notion that mood-incongruent recall is used as a mood-repairstrategy in response to a negative mood induction. These results suggest that depression isassociated with problems in utilizing a common and effective emotion-regulation strategy andthat these difficulties may be related to the biases in memory that characterize this disorder.Reappraisal is also an important emotion-regulation strategy. Cognitive processing, includingbiases in attention and memory and individual differences in cognitive control, are likely toaffect individuals\u2019 ability to use this strategy effectively. Because the experience of a moodstate or an emotion is generally associated with the activation of mood-congruentrepresentations in WM, difficulties in controlling the contents of WM should affect emotionregulation (Siemer 2005). In addition, effective reappraisal may depend on a person\u2019s abilityto override (automatic) attention and interpretation biases that lead to unwanted appraisals ofthe emotion-eliciting cues. Because replacing automatic appraisals with alternative evaluationsGotlib and Joormann Page 17Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptof the situation requires cognitive control, the ability to control the contents of WM is certainto play an important role in emotion regulation. Thus, an inability to appropriately expel mood-congruent items from WM as they become irrelevant would lead to difficulties attending toand processing new information and might also result in rumination and the use of other mal-adaptive emotion-regulation strategies. Difficulties inhibiting salient but irrelevant thoughtsand memories would also discourage the use of more effective emotion-regulation strategies,such as reappraisal.As we outline above, deficits in inhibitory processes may also play a central role in theoccurrence of ruminative responses. According to Nolen-Hoeksema and her colleagues,rumination is a particularly detrimental response to negative affect that hinders recovery fromnegative mood and prolongs depressive episodes (Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 2008). Whatcharacterizes rumination and differentiates it from negative automatic thoughts is that it is astyle of thought rather than just negative content (Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 2008). Thus,rumination is defined by the process of recurring thoughts and ideas (often described as arecycling of thoughts) and not necessarily by the content of the thoughts. In an extensiveprogram of experimental and correlational studies, Nolen-Hoeksema and colleaguesinvestigated rumination in depression and dysphoria and examined how this response styleexacerbates sad moods and predicts future depressive episodes (e.g., Morrow & Nolen-Hoeskema 1990). Self-reported levels of rumination have been found to predict higher levelsof dysphoria in prospective studies with nonclinical samples, even after controlling for initialdifferential depression levels (e.g., Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow 1991). Moreover, studies haveshown that rumination predicts higher levels of depressive symptoms and onset of majordepressive episodes and mediates the gender difference in depressive symptoms (Nolen-Hoeksema 2000, Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 2007). Research also indicates that ruminationenhances the operation of cognitive biases. Thus, dysphoric participants who were induced toruminate endorsed more negative interpretations of hypothetical situations, generated less-effective problem-solving strategies (Lyubomirsky & Nolen-Hoeksema 1995), and exhibitedincreased recall of negative autobiographical memories (Lyubomirsky et al. 1998 ). Similarly,Singer & Dobson (2007) found that remitted depressed patients who were instructed toruminate during a negative mood induction had higher levels of depressed mood than didparticipants who were instructed to use distraction.Davis & Nolen-Hoeksema (2000) reported that ruminators made more errors on the WCSTthan did nonruminators. Because the WCST measures executive control and cognitiveflexibility, these results provide empirical support for the hypothesis that rumination is relatedto the executive control component of WM. In addition, Joormann (2006)  reported a correlationbetween rumination and deficits in cognitive inhibition as assessed by negative priming, andJoormann & Gotlib (2008) found a correlation between rumination and the ability to removeirrelevant negative material from WM. These findings suggest that deficits in executive controland inhibition are related to sustained processing of negative material and rumination, whichin turn maintains the negative mood state and hinders recovery from negative affect.TREATMENT IMPLICATIONSIn this final section of this review, we describe what we believe are exciting developments inresearch examining clinical interventions that build on the findings discussed above. Recentstudies examining the effectiveness of modifying cognitive biases have demonstrated thattraining biases and improving cognitive control reduces other symptoms of emotionaldisorders. For example, training highly anxious people to disengage their attention from threatmaterial has been found to lead to changes in mood and reduced reactivity to stressful events.In a typical training paradigm, the dot probe is presented more frequently in the location of thenonthreat-relevant stimuli (rather than equally following threat and nonthreat stimuli) so thatGotlib and Joormann Page 18Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptparticipants learn to attend to neutral stimuli. Using this approach, MacLeod et al. (2002)  firstestablished that attentional biases could be modified by working with participants who scoredin the middle third of the distribution on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielbergeret al. 1971). They found that after attentional training away from the threat, participantsreported reduced negative affect to a standardized stress manipulation. In a subsequent study,Mathews & MacLeod (2002) established that the attentional training was effective in reducinganxiety in high-STAI scorers one month before a school examination. More recently,Wadlinger & Isaacowitz (2008) extended MacLeod and colleagues\u2019 (2002) findings bydemonstrating that positive attentional biases can also be trained. Moreover, participants whohad been trained to attend to positive stimuli subsequently looked less at negative images duringa stress induction. On the basis of these findings, researchers have begun to examine attentionaltraining with clinical samples; thus far, however, no studies have examined whether modifyingcognitive biases in depressed participants leads to improved emotion regulation.Researchers have also begun to modify interpretive biases in anxiety with the goal of improvingadaptive emotional responding. Mathews & Mackintosh (2000), for example, used ambiguousscenarios to train individuals to make either positive (nonanxious) or negative (anxious)interpretations of ambiguous text. These authors found that participants in the negative trainingcondition exhibited higher levels of anxiety following the training than did participants in thepositive training condition, suggesting that interpretive biases play a causal role in affectinganxiety levels. Yiend et al. (2005) demonstrated that the effects of interpretive training onanxiety were still present after a 24-hour delay between the training and a subsequent test. Ina related study, participants who received interpretive training using ambiguous homophoneswere subsequently presented four distressing television clips of real-life emergency rescuesituations (Wilson et al. 2006). Participants who were trained to interpret ambiguity in anonthreatening manner had an attenuated anxiety reaction to the subsequent video stressor.Holmes et al. (2009) found in a nonclinical sample that training positive biases using imageryhelped to alleviate an induced negative mood state. Considered collectively, these resultsindicate that changes in interpretation biases can instigate changes in emotional responding.Again, however, no studies have yet investigated whether modifying interpretive biases indepression affects emotional responding. In a recent investigation, Tran et al. (2009)demonstrated that an interpretative bias training affected memory in a subsequent free-recalltask in nondepressed participants. Participants who were trained to adopt a positiveinterpretation bias exhibited more positive than negative intrusions (i.e., increased \u201crecall\u201d ofpositive material that was not presented at encoding; in contrast, participants who were trainedto adopt a negative interpretation bias exhibited more negative than positive intrusions. Thisfinding is important in suggesting that interpretation and memory biases are closely relatedand that training interpretation in depression may be effective in modifying memory biases.Clearly, more studies are needed to examine this proposition explicitly.Recently, investigators have begun to examine the effects of training cognitive control onemotion regulation in depression. One particularly promising study found that trainingdysphoric individuals to be more concrete and less overgeneral in their thinking led to asignificant reduction in depressive symptoms and rumination (Watkins et al. 2009 ). Likewise,Raes et al. (2009) presented preliminary findings that memory-specificity training led tochanges in memory retrieval that were accompanied by changes in rumination and problemsolving in depressed patients. Joormann et al. (2005, 2009e)  showed that depressed participantscould be trained to forget negative material by practicing active suppression and did particularlywell when they were provided with a strategy of how to keep irrelevant material from enteringWM by using thought substitutes. Unfortunately, these authors did not assess whethersuppression training affected mood or emotional reactivity to a stressor. Siegle et al. (2007),however, presented preliminary data demonstrating that a brief intervention targeted atincreasing cognitive control in severely depressed outpatients led to significant decreases inGotlib and Joormann Page 19Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptboth depressive symptoms and rumination. Indeed, recent work by this group indicates thattraining in attentional control may be an effective treatment for depression (Siegle et al.2007). In this training, patients learn to selectively attend to certain sounds while ignoringirrelevant sounds. After two weeks of training, patients exhibited greater decreases indepressive symptoms than did patients who received treatment as usual. Notably, the trainingconsisted of short sessions (15 minutes) that used nonaffective stimuli, such as the sound ofbirds. This suggests that cognitive control can be improved with practice and further supportsthe formulation that difficulties in cognitive control are implicated in emotion dysregulation.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSIn sum, depression is characterized by a specific pattern of biased processing of emotionalmaterial that includes increased elaboration of negative information, difficulties disengagingfrom negative material, and deficits in cognitive control when processing negative material.In this review, we discussed how these biases may be linked to emotion dysregulation indepression and, thereby, to sustained negative affect, the core feature of depressive episodes.Because the experience of negative mood states and negative life events is associated with theactivation of mood-congruent cognitions in WM, the ability to control the contents of WM islikely to be critical in differentiating people who recover easily from negative affect from thosewho initiate a vicious cycle of increasingly negative ruminative thinking and deepening sadmood. Interventions focused on directly modifying cognitive biases and on increasingcognitive control hold considerable promise for improving the effectiveness of the treatmentof depression.Clearly, studies are needed that examine more explicitly and systematically the mechanismsthat underlie depressive cognition and the role of cognition in the regulation of emotion. In thiscontext, investigations integrating biological and psychological aspects of depression will beparticularly important in increasing our understanding of the relation between cognitivedysfunction and depression. For example, a growing literature is beginning to elucidate theneural circuitry of emotions (e.g., Ochsner & Gross 2008) and, in particular, the brain structuresimplicated in depression (Cooney et al. 2007, Gotlib & Hamilton 2008). These studies havedocumented the involvement of the limbic system, including the amygdala, hippocampus, andparts of the anterior cingulate cortex in the experience of both emotional states and depression,as well as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the regulation of emotion. Interestingly,Johnstone et al. (2007) reported that during reappraisal of emotional pictures, nondepressedindividuals, but not their depressed counterparts, were characterized by increased dorsolateralprefrontal cortex activation and decreased amygdala activation that appeared to be mediatedby the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, suggesting depression-associated difficulties inrecruiting brain regions involved in the cognitive control of emotions. Similarly, given theimportance of inhibitory functioning in depression, Eugene et al. (2009) presented study resultsthat underscore the importance of assessing activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortexas depressed individuals attempt to inhibit the processing of negative stimuli, and Johnson etal. (2009) found reduced activation in medial frontal cortex in depressed participants duringambiguous self-referential processing. Although these findings are exciting and provideevidence that documents associations among inhibition, reappraisal, rumination, and emotionregulation in depression, more studies are clearly needed to increase our understanding of thebrain regions and neural circuits involved in cognitive inhibition and executive functioning indepression.The recent surge in studies of specific genes that may be implicated in depression is alsobecoming increasingly relevant to the study of cognitive functioning in this disorder. Severalstudies have now linked the short allele of a functional 5 \u2032 promoter polymorphism of theserotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) to the onset of depression, particularly in the contextGotlib and Joormann Page 20Annu Rev Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 27.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptof stressful life events (see Uher & McGuffin 2008 and Lau & Eley 2010 for recent reviewsof this literature; see Risch et al. 2009 for a meta-analysis). Investigators have now begun toexamine associations of 5-HTTLPR with cognitive biases in depression. Beevers et al.(2007) , for example, reported a link between 5-HTTLPR and attentional bias on the dot-probetask in psychiatric inpatients; Hayden et al. (2008) similarly found 5-HTTLPR to be associatedwith biased recall on a self-referent encoding task in girls at risk for depression. Suchinvestigations that integrate the examination of patterns of neural activation, genetics, andcognitive processing hold great promise to help us gain a more comprehensive understandingof how psychological and biological factors interact to affect the onset, maintenance, andcourse of depression.LITERATURE CITEDAm.

            "SupportingText": "Depressed people often complain of concentration difficulties (Watts & Sharrock 1985); indeed, “difficulty concentrating” is a symptom of a major depressive episode in DSM-IV. In addition, there is a large literature that strongly suggests that depressed individuals are characterized by memory impairments (see Burt et al. 1995, Mathews & MacLeod 2005). In the frequently cited meta-analysis by Burt et al. (1995), memory impairments were reported more consistently for inpatients than for outpatients. Moreover, and not surprisingly, memory impairments were also reported in other psychological disorders. Burt et al. proposed, therefore, that memory deficits are associated with psychopathology in general rather than with depression specifically. Furthermore, in a series of studies, Hertel and collaborators (e.g., Hertel 1998, Hertel & Rude 1991) presented evidence indicating that depression-related impairments are not observed in all components of memory, but are found primarily in free recall tasks and in controlled aspects of recognition. Overall, studies conducted thus far provide evidence that depression is associated with greater memory impairment in contexts in which (a) attention is not constrained by the task (e.g., Hertel & Rude 1991); (b) increased cognitive effort is required (see review by Hartlage et al. 1993); and (c) attention is easily allocated to personal concerns and other thoughts that are irrelevant to the task (Ellis & Ashbrook 1988). Importantly, Hertel & Rude (1991) were able to eliminate a depressive deficit by providing instructions that focused participants on the task and did not allow task irrelevant thoughts. Hertel (1998) also found comparable deficits in recall between dysphoric students who had to wait in an unconstrained situation (without being given any instructions regarding what to do during the waiting period) and dysphoric students who were instructed to rate self-focused material designed to induce rumination. In contrast, no deficit was found for dysphoric students who were instructed what to do during the waiting period (rating self-irrelevant and task-irrelevant material)."

(1993), for example, found few differences between depressed and nondepressed participants on a variety of WM tasks (i.e., only on the backward digit span; see also Barch et al. 2003). Most of the tasks that are used to assess WM (e.g., the digit span) involve relatively short retention intervals and, thus, seem to allow a more direct assessment of attentional processes irrespective of retrieval from long-term memory. These tasks have been criticized, however, because the relatively slow presentations that are used to ensure perception might allow for chunking and active rehearsal of material and, therefore, might reflect memory deficits rather than deficits in attention (Rokke et al. 2002). Using an attentional blink paradigm that involves rapid serial presentations, Rokke et al. found significant group differences in performance between moderately to severely dysphoric (Beck Depression Inventory scores over 21) and nondysphoric participants, but only under demanding dual-tasking conditions. It is important to note, however, that only nine moderately to severely dysphoric participants were included in this study, so these findings should be interpreted with caution."

            "SupportingText": "Overall, there is strong evidence for biased memory processes in depression (Mathews & MacLeod 2005). Indeed, preferential recall of negative compared to positive material is one of the most robust findings in the depression literature (Mathews & MacLeod 2005, Matt et al. 1992, Williams et al. 1997). In a meta-analysis of studies assessing recall performance, Matt and colleagues found that people with major depression remembered 10% more negative words than they did positive words. In contrast, nondepressed controls exhibited a memory bias for positive information in 20 of 25 studies. It should be noted, however, that memory biases are found most consistently in free recall tasks, and may be restricted to explicit memory. Results of studies using recognition or implicit memory measures have been much less consistent. In his review of the implicit memory literature, Watkins (2002) reported that, across studies, no bias is found in depressed participants when the encoding and/or the recall of the emotional material depend purely on perceptual processing. For example, if depressed participants are asked to count the letters in emotional words at encoding and to complete word stems or word fragments at recall, no evidence of an implicit memory bias is obtained (Watkins et al. 2000). If, however, participants are asked to rate the recency of their experience with the word or to imagine themselves in a scene involving the word at encoding, and are asked to freely associate to a cue word or to provide a word that fits a given definition, implicit memory biases are obtained more consistently. Encoding and recall in these latter studies require semantic instead of pure perceptual processing of the material. This suggests that depressive deficits are due in large part to differences in the elaboration of the emotional material."

Importantly, Harvey et al. did not find depressionassociated differences on a number of other tasks assessing WM functioning, including a digit span. Consistent with these findings, Egeland et al. (2003) concluded from the results of their study that reduced performance on WM tasks in depression is due not to a specific deficit in executive functioning, but to a nonspecific reduction in speed and to a loss of vigilance that is consistent with a lack of effort. Grant et al. (2001) administered a battery of cognitive tasks to 123 depressed outpatients and noted the surprising absence of cognitive deficits in their sample. The only indications of deficits were fewer completed categories, increased perseveration, and impaired maintenance of set on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), a widely used measure of executive control and cognitive flexibility. These results suggest the operation of depression-related deficits in the generation and maintenance of problem-solving strategies and difficulties in set switching (see also Harvey et al. 2004). Importantly, though, there was no evidence of deficits in executive functioning on any of the other tasks administered in this study. Grant et al. concluded that pervasive cognitive deficits most likely characterize elderly depressed people and severely depressed inpatients who present with psychotic features (see Harvey et al. 2004 and Rose & Ebmeier 2006 for similar conclusions). In a recent review paper, Castaneda et al. (2008) concluded that deficits in certain aspects of executive control and attentional deficits most likely characterize depressed people whereas evidence for learning and memory deficits is more mixed. They also pointed out, however, that there is significant variability in the extent to which studies report deficits and that this variability is due to the subtype of depression"

Moreover, the subliminal priming effect was more closely associated with level of depression than with level of anxiety. Bradley et al.

Instead, whereas anxiety disorders are associated with quick detection of and fast orienting toward threat-related stimuli, results of studies investigating the automatic processing of negative material in depression are equivocal. Once negative material has become the focus of attention, however, depressed individuals are prone to elaborate on it and have difficulty stopping or inhibiting the processing of this material.

Notably, the training consisted of short sessions (15 minutes) that used nonaffective stimuli, such as the sound of birds. This suggests that cognitive control can be improved with practice and further supports the formulation that difficulties in cognitive control are implicated in emotion dysregulation"
