Cognitive dysfunction represents a core diagnostic and symptomatic\ncriterion of MDD, and is a principal determinant of functional non-recovery. Cognitive\nimpairment has been observed to persist despite remission of mood symptoms,\nsuggesting dissociability of mood and cognitive symptoms in MDD. Recurrent\nimpairments in several domains including, but not limited to, executive function, learning\nand memory, processing speed, and attention and concentration, are associated\nwith poor psychosocial and occupational outcomes. Attempts to restore premorbid\nfunctioning in individuals with MDD requires regular screenings and assessment of\nobjective and subjective measures of cognition by clinicians. Easily accessible and\ncost-effective tools such as the THINC-integrated tool (THINC-it) are suitable for use\nin a busy clinical environment and appear to be promising for routine usage in clinical\nsettings. However, antidepressant treatments targeting specific cognitive domains in\nMDD have been insufficiently studied. While select antidepressants, e.g., vortioxetine,\nhave been demonstrated to have direct and independent pro-cognitive effects in adults\nwith MDD, research on additional agents remains nascent. A comprehensive clinical\napproach to cognitive impairments in MDD is required. The current narrative review aims\nto delineate the importance and relevance of cognitive dysfunction as a symptomatic\ntarget for prevention and treatment in the phenomenology of MDD.\n\nKeywords: cognition, cognitive dysfunction, major depressive disorder, functionality, treatment\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a prevalent, often chronic, and highly disabling\nmultidimensional psychiatric illness affecting ~350 million individuals worldwide (1).\nEpidemiological research suggests that depression constitutes the leading cause of disability\nworldwide (1). MDD is characterized by short- and/or long-term impairment affecting areas\nincluding, but not limited to, mood, affect, motivation, and cognition, and is frequently correlated\nwith significant reductions in quality of life and psychosocial functioning (2). Despite therapeutic\n\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org\n\n1 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 655\n\n\nZuckerman et al.\n\nCognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorder\n\nadvances in MDD, an estimated 70% of patients do not achieve\nremission following first-line antidepressant medication (3).\nMoreover, a significant percentage of patients that successfully\nachieve conventional symptomatic remission (i.e., reduction in\ntotal depressive symptom severity) do not return to premorbid\nfunctioning (4). The lack of full functional recovery results\nin decreased workplace functionality and productivity, further\ncontributing to the significant economic burden imposed by\nMDD, with an accumulated annual loss of $43 billion in North\nAmerica (5, 6).\n\nSeveral regions of the brain, including the hippocampus,\nare negatively implicated in the pathophysiology MDD.\nHippocampal size has been demonstrated to be inversely\ncorrelated with illness duration, whereby smaller hippocampal\nsizes have been associated with more severe histories of\ndepression (7). Size has also been shown to be influenced by\nthe number of past hospitalizations and recurrence of the\ndisorder. Frequent, chronic and lengthy states of depression\nimpart impairing effects on brain function, debasing human\ncapital. Without adequate treatment, brain recovery may\nbe compromised, resulting in negative downstream effects\non the global functional outcomes in MDD. Amongst the\ndisparate domains affected in depression, cognition is the\nmost relevant dimension related to the loss of human capital.\nWhile MDD treatment efforts have focused on clinically\nobserved symptomatic targets including depressed mood and\nanhedonia, emerging evidence has dissociated symptomatic\nimprovement in these domains from functional improvement\nand timely return-to-work (8). The foregoing transition\nhighlights the necessity for novel targets more closely associated\nwith the restoration of premorbid psychosocial functioning.\nToward this aim, cognitive dysfunction has emerged as a key\nmediator subserving adverse functional impairment in MDD\n(9-12).\n\nCognition is a nons-pecific term that refers to mental\nprocesses associated with thinking, learning, and memory (13).\nCognitive dysfunction can be defined as a transnosological\ndomain serving as an essential mediator of disparate mental\ndisorders (14). Clinical presentation of MDD, as defined by\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-\nFifth Edition (DSM-5), includes cognitive impairment as a\ncriterion item of a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) (15). Self-\nreported measures of diminished concentration and attention are\nfrequently observed in individuals presenting with MDE as part\nof MDD. Moreover, when treating MDD, cognitive impairments\nare often found to persist during periods of symptomatic\nremission (14), supporting the disconnect between emotional\nand functional improvement. While cognitive symptoms may\nindirectly improve as a consequence of standard antidepressant\ncare, cognitive dysfunction is believed to be a core disturbance\nin subsets of adults with MDD, independent of mood\nsymptoms (16).\n\nMDD fundamentally alters one\u2019s perception and interaction\nwith their surrounding environment, affecting not only the\nsocial environment but also information and intellectual\nprocessing. Insufficiency surrounding remission outcomes\namongst individuals with MDD delineates the importance\n\nof novel identification and optimization in recognition and\ntreatment avenues. Successful outcomes rely on a heightened\nfocus encompassing the needs of the patient, the provider, and\nsocietal perspectives. Recent developments have thus begun to\nuncover the relevance of cognition as a clinical priority. Hitherto,\ndisturbances in cognitive function have been undermined in\ntheir significance in MDD relative to other psychiatric disorder\npopulations, however, accumulating evidence indicates that\na disturbance in cognitive function represents a principal\ndeterminant of health outcomes in subsets of MDD patients.\nCognitive dysfunction in MDD is common, pervasive across\nmultiple subdomains of cognitive function, and provides a\nprincipal determinant of health outcomes with respect to the\npatient, as well as the societal perspectives. Herein, the current\nnarrative review will provide an up-to-date summary of the\nliterature pertaining to the domain of cognitive function in\nMDD. The current review aims to provide a framework for\nthe conceptualization of cognition in MDD, with particular\nfocus on the relevance, measurements, and treatment strategies\nexplicating depression as a progressive cognitive disorder.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe authors conducted a narrative review of studies investigating\ncognition as a relevant aspect of Major Depressive Disorder.\nStudies were identified using PubMed/Medline and Google\nScholar from inception to June 2018. MDD (and/or variants)\nwas cross-referenced with the following search terms: cognition,\ncognitive dysfunction, cognitive deficit, cognitive function,\nfunctional outcomes, antidepressants, and treatment. Articles\ninformed by observational studies, clinical trials, and review\narticles relevant to cognition and cognitive impairment in\nMDD were included. Additionally, the search was augmented\nthrough manual review of related terms and citations from\narticle reference lists.\n\nDomains of Cognition\n\nCognition and emotion are interconnected processes\noriginating from large interacting networks of neurons\nwithin the brain. In recent decades, interdisciplinary fields\nincluding neurophysiology, and cognitive psychology have\nshed light on the neural underpinnings of various cognitive\nfunctions and processes; however, the current understanding\nof these phenomena remains rudimentary. Cognition is\nmultidimensional and lacks a singular consensually agreed\nupon taxonomy. Several typologies have been proposed for\nthe definition and operationalization of cognitive constructs.\nAmongst these is the conventional typology distinguishing\ncognitive aspects into four main domains\u2014namely executive\nfunction, attention/concentration, learning/memory, and\nprocessing speed (17). The aforementioned domains are\ninterconnected yet distinct phenomena. An additional proposed\ntypology was introduced by the RDoC which, although not\nlimited to cognitive domains, it emphasizes disturbances across\nmultiple cognitive subdomains (18, 19). Moreover, the literature\nhas further proposed a clinically relevant taxonomy with two\ndistinct domains\u2014namely, \u201ccold\u201d cognition and \u201chot\u201d cognition\n\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www. frontiersin.org\n\nDecember 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 655\n\n\nZuckerman et al.\n\nCognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorder\n\n(20) (Table 1). By definition, \u201ccold\u201d cognition refers to non-\nemotional information processing; therefore, these cognitive\nprocesses occur in the absence of emotional engagement and/or\nmotivation. \u201cCold\u201d cognitive processes are used in the evaluation\nof neuropsychological function in depression (20) and generally\ninclude the following subdomains of cognition: executive\nfunction, learning and memory, attention and concentration,\nand processing speed. Examples of commonly administered\nobjective neuropsychological tests include the Rey Auditory\nVerbal Learning Test (RAVLT) (e.g, acquisition and recall),\nTrail- Making Test A/B (TMT A/B TMT A: processing speed\nTMT B: processing speed, executive function i.e., set shifting),\nand Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST processing speed,\nexecutive function, learning and memory, attention, and\nconcentration) (12). In contrast, \u201chot\u201d cognition refers to\nemotionally-laden cognitive processes; these functions are\ninfluenced by the individual's emotional state and may include\nnegative attentional bias, emotionally-linked recall, rumination,\nand anhedonia (20). However, it is important to note that the\nweighted significance and distinction between \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d\ncognition in depressed individuals is non-discrete and there are\nmany overlapping features between the two constructs (20, 21).\n\nNeuropsychological testing reveals important inferences into\ndisruptive pathophysiology of neural brain networks with\ndirect consequences on \u201ccold\u201d cognitive functioning. Neural\nnetworks including the prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus,\nsubcortical regions in the striatum and thalamus, and temporal\nlobe structures including the amygdala and hippocampus are\nfound to be functionally altered in depressive states (22).\nMore specifically, deficits in executive functioning have been\nassociated with pathophysiology in the lateral aspects of the\nprefrontal cortex. Additionally, memory impairment has been\nevidenced to be associated with reductions in hippocampal\nvolume which may be a progressive consequence of MDD (22).\nThe circuitry of these structures has formed the targeted basis of\nvarious established treatments for depression, however, currently\navailable treatments are not effective in all cases and requires\nfurther understanding into the cognitive deficits and neural\n\u2018markers characterizing MDD.\n\nMDD as a Cognitive Disorder\n\nimportant phenomenological domain of MDD, abnormalities\nin cognition may be used as a prognostic indicator for\nidentifying at-risk individuals and/or assessing disease onset\nand progression. Manifestation of cognitive deficits are\n\nTABLE 1 | Hot and cold cognitive processes.\n\nHot cognition Cold cognition\n\nRumination Executive function\nEmotional processing\nAnhedonia (reward processing)\n\nAttentional bias\n\nProcessing speed\nLearning and memory\nAttention and concentration\n\nheterogeneous across individuals with MDD and vary depending\non disparate individual- and illness-specific factors. For example,\nthe magnitude of cognitive deficits has been demonstrated to\nbe proportionate to the frequency of depressive episodes and\nduration of illness (7, 12). In keeping with this, individuals with\ngreater depressive symptom severity are more likely to present\nwith cognitive impairments as compared to those with milder\nillness severity (12). Moreover, a systematic review evaluating\nclinical progression in affective disorders, including MDD,\nsuggested that cognitive function is associated with the duration\n\nand number of prior episodes (23). Unipolar depression has also\n\n(23).\n\nIt is important to note that available studies often include\nhighly heterogeneous populations. This is an important\nconsideration as there are various co-determinants of\ncognitive function in MDD that may exact mediational and/or\nmoderational effects alongside illness severity and duration. For\nexample, the presence of co-morbid medical and/or psychiatric\nconditions may exert direct effects on cognitive function and\nperformance (24, 25). Metabolic co-morbidities, such as obesity,\nhave also been associated with cognitive impairments and are\ncommonly observed in depressed individuals (26). In particular,\nstudies have suggested that obesity is correlated with significant\ndeficits in executive functions such as working memory,\nplanning, and executive control (24). In addition, factors such\nas age (27), age at onset of depression (28), level of education\n(29), MDD subtype (30), inflammatory status (31), treatment\nregimen (32), and childhood adversity (33) have also been\ndemonstrated to influence cognitive performance in patients\npresenting with MDD (Figure 1). Significant impairments in\ncognitive domains have been reported to precede, occur during,\nand follow an illness episode; therefore, the temporality and/or\ncausality of the association between cognitive impairment and\nMDEs remains elusive. Although scarce, studies have evaluated\ncognitive dysfunction as a risk factor for the development\nof MDD. In a population study evaluating non-depressed\nindividuals between 20 and 64 years of age found that low\nepisodic memory performance was a reliable predictor of\ndepression 3 years post-diagnosis (34). Moreover, a separate\nstudy evaluating longitudinal profiles of depressive symptoms\nin a birth cohort found that depression is associated with\nneurodevelopmental impairments which may be mediated by\ncognition (35). Moreover, cognitive functioning may also be used\n\nas a predictor of treatment response. In a recently conducted\n\nClinically, cognition has been classified into four subdomains:\n(1) learning and memory, (2) attention and concentration,\n(3) executive function, and (4) processing speed.

Limitations of conventional clinical assessment measures\n[e.g Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), MADRS] are\nsuboptimal insofar as they contain insufficient items assessing\ncognitive function. Moreover, they are subjective in nature\nand have been shown to have minimal correlation with\n\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www. frontiersin.org\n\nDecember 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 655\n\n\nZuckerman et al.\n\nobjective measures of cognition (39). Subjective cognition is\noften influenced by emotional state, and consequently may be\naffected by the severity of depressive symptoms to a greater\nextent than objective measures of cognition. Therefore, although\nsubjective measures provide an accurate report of perceived\ncognitive function, it does not necessarily formulate an accurate\nmeasure of objective cognitive ability. In clinical practice, a\nvast array of neurocognitive tests have been employed for\nthe measurement and evaluation of cognitive impairments\nin MDD [e.g,, DSST, TMT, Perceived Deficits Questionnaire\n(PDQ)]. These conventional instruments are routinely used and\nfrequently administered for the assessment of cognitive function;\nhowever, they were not specifically developed or tailored to\nevaluate MDD-specific cognitive deficits.\n\nLimitations related to the accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and\necological validity of standard tools for measuring cognition\nin MDD need to be addressed for the improvement of health\noutcomes in MDD. The THINC-integrated tool (THINC-it)\nis a recently validated, computerized cognitive assessment\nbattery that screens both objective and subjective cognitive\ndeficits in MDD (45). The THINC-it tool was validated as\na sensitive tool in detecting and quantifying the magnitude\nof cognitive deficits in adults between the ages of 18 and 65\nwith MDD (45). It effectively evaluates objective measures\nof cognition through the inclusion of adaptations of four\nvalidated tests (i.e, N-Back/Symbol Check, DSST/Codebreaker,\nTMT-B/Trails, and CRT/Spotter). These tasks accurately assess\ncognitive subdomains including working memory, visuospatial\ncoordination, set shifting, and psychomotor speed. Additionally,\nsubjective measures of cognition are evaluated through the\nPerceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ-5). Compared to\ntraditional pen-and-paper based cognitive measures such as\nthe DSST, TMT-B and PDQ-5-D, the tool has greater temporal\nreliability and concurrent validity (45). It is important to\nnote, however, that there are not clear cut-off criteria or\nprecise values for the individual tests that would enhance\nits use in both diagnosis and treatment response clinically.\nTo our knowledge, the THINC-it is the first freely available\ncomputerized tool for screening cognitive dysfunction in MDD.\nOther developed methods for screening cognitive dysfunction in\nMDD include the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry\n(SCIP-D) and the Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder\nAssessment (COBRA). The SCIP-D and COBRA have been\nvalidated as methods to assess objective and subjective cognitive\nimpairment in MDD, respectively (46). While the COBRA has\npoorer sensitivity and specificity for the detection of objective\ndysfunction as compared to the SCIP-D, the SCIP-D has greater\nsensitivity and specificity for objective dysfunction; therefore,\nthe COBRA can be used in combination with the SCIP-D to\nincrease sensitivity and specificity for the detection of objective\ndysfunction in MDD (46).\n\nTreatment Interventions Targeting\nCognitive Dysfunction in MDD\n\nThe evaluation of subsyndromal depressive symptoms (SSD) in\npatients with MDD is relevant for both treatment selection and\n\nby targeting mood symptoms; however, residual impairments\nin cognition that are not sufficiently targeted may impose\nnegative effects on workplace performance and productivity\nor delay a timely return to work. Targeted treatment of\ncognitive impairments in MDD may capitalize on modifiable\ndeterminants, focusing on prevention and pre-emption.\n\nCognitive Remediation and Cognitive Therapy\n\nPsychological methods have been proposed for the treatment\nand management of neurocognitive impairments in disparate\nneuropsychiatric conditions including MDD (48). Brain imaging\n\nlimbic system coincident with decreased activity in executive\nareas of the brain (49). Cognitive remediation (CR) is a\npsychosocial approach aimed at relieving cognitive impairments\nin individuals with diverse brain disorders including, but not\nlimited to, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),\n\ndomains (e.g, psychosocial skills). Tt has been used for the\ntreatment of maladaptive cognitive thought patterns that are\nprevalent in MDD. Cognitive training has effects on brain\nstructure and function, and has demonstrated effects on\n\nneurobiological systems adversely affected in mood disorders\nsuch as schizophrenia) (50).

The use of CBT in combination\nwith pharmacotherapy in adult depression has been shown to\ntarget primarily hot cognitive processes and be more effective\nthan pharmacotherapy alone (54). Notwithstanding, there are\na number of patients that do not successfully respond to CBT\n(55). Consequently, studies have aimed to investigate various\nsubtypes and pathoetiology of depression with the goal of\ninforming possible predictors of treatment response. Several\nstudies have suggested that abnormalities in medial prefrontal\ncortex (MPEC) (56) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (57)\nmay contribute to the cognitive impairments observed in MDD.\nFor example, a study found that following CBT treatment, the\nfunctional connectivity between MPFC-ACC was significantly\nreduced. Moreover, symptomatic improvement was positively\ncorrelated with a change in MPFC-ACC functional connectivity,\n(58) suggesting that CBT could potentially be effective as a\nprecognitive intervention.\n\nNeurostimulation\n\nNeurostimulation methods have been shown to be highly\neffective in the treatment of depression. For example,\nelectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a neurostimulation method\nthat has been demonstrated to be efficacious in the acute\ntreatment of depression (59). Negative neurocognitive bias\nrepresents a centric feature of major depression that is associated\nwith significant risk of relapse (60), with evidence highlighting\nnegative face processing persisting into periods of remission (61).\nPrevious research provides evidence for various antidepressants\nas rapid modulators of cognitive and neural emotional face\nprocessing, prior to symptom improvement (62, 63). Contrary\nto this, compounds lacking antidepressant efficacy have no effect\non emotional bias (63). The capacity of ECT as a modulator\nof neurocognitive response to emotional information has\nrecently been studied. In the first conducted double-blind,\nsham-controlled, parallel-group study, the effect of a single\nECT session on the neurocognitive response to emotional\ninformation in MDD was evaluated. The results revealed changes\nin parahippocampal and superior frontal responses to fearful vs.\nhappy faces, as well as in fear-specific functional connectivity\nbetween amygdala and occipito-temporal regions in response\nto single-session ECT treatment (64). Although no statistically\nsignificant shift in the neural response to faces was observed\nfollowing ECT, the trend is suggestive of early shifts in emotional\nprocessing that contribute to the antidepressant activity of\nECT (64).\n\nDespite its promising use in the reversal of heightened\nneurocognitive response in MDD, the use of ECT is prejudiced\ndue to reports of cognitive impairments following individual\ntreatment. Some patients report acute disorientation and\ncognitive deficits, with uncertainty surrounding the duration\nof the short- and long-term cognitive deficits. In a meta-\nanalysis of 84 studies and 2,981 patients that aimed to evaluate\nthe cognitive impairments following ECT, significant cognitive\n\nimpairments (i.e., in verbal and visual episodic memory and\nexecutive function) were identified in depressed patients within\n3 days of treatment. However, these deficits in cognitive function\nfollowing ECT did not persist beyond 15 days post-treatment,\nwith small to medium effect sizes of improvement for most\nvariables (i.e., processing speed, verbal working memory, and\nexecutive function)(59).\n\nMore recently, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation\n(rTMS) has emerged as a neurostimulation method for\nimproving neurocognitive function in patients with MDD, and\nis generally viewed more favorably due to its less invasive\nnature and diminished propensity for cognitive impairment\n(65). A systematic review analyzing the role of rTMS in\nimproving neurocognition in patients with treatment-resistant\ndepression (TRD) found that the majority of studies support\nan association between rTMS and improved neurocognitive\neffects (66). Much of the literature focuses on the dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as a target for rTMS as it is a critical\nbrain region for neurocognitive performance (67). Stimulation\nof the DLPEC through rTMS has been shown to produce\nvariable improvements in psychomotor speed, attention, verbal\nfluency, executive function, and other working memory domains\nin patients with TRD (66). The foregoing evidence suggests\npotential procognitive effects following neurostimulation via\nrTMS. However, it remains to be determined whether rTMS\nand/or other neurostimulation techniques can reliably and\neffectively ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in MDD.\n\nPharmacotherapy\n\nThe counterintuitive gap between remission from depressive\nsymptoms and functional recovery warrants the evaluation of\ntherapeutic avenues targeted at improving cognitive symptoms\nin individuals with MDD. Notwithstanding the current\nneed for novel targets to facilitate symptomatic remission\ncoincident with functional productivity and timely return-\nto-work, pharmacotherapies have been scarcely evaluated for\ntheir direct and independent effects on cognition in MDD.\nIndividuals with MDD routinely receive interventions [e.g.,\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and\nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine\noxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), antipsychotics] with potentially\nadverse effects on cognitive measures (20). Persistent functional\nimpairments mediated by cognitive dysfunction in individuals\nwith MDD warrants the identification of pharmacotherapies\nwith pro-cognitive effects.\n\nDetermination of the magnitude of effect of an antidepressant\non cognitive function has posed significant limitations as study\ndesigns and assessment methodologies are not standardized in\nimplementation. Notwithstanding these inconsistencies amongst\nstudies, certain pharmacotherapies have demonstrated beneficial\neffects on cognitive measures of individuals with MDD. A\nsystematic review and meta-analysis that aimed to evaluate\nthe overall effect of antidepressants on cognitive function in\nMDD revealed that SSRIs/SNRIs have more beneficial effects on\nmemory domains compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs),\nbut exhibit equivalent effects on working memory compared\nto norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) [60].\n\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www. frontiersin.org\n\nDecember 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 655\n\n\nZuckerman et al.\n\nCognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorder\n\nWithin the class of SSRIs, sertraline was found to have\nmore beneficial effects on psychomotor speed compared to\nfluoxetine\u2019. However, the results from this meta-analysis were\n\ngreater improvements in declarative and working memory\n\naged subpopulations with MDD. For example, in a 12-week\nopen-label trial, duloxetine was found to significantly improve\ncognitive function, particularly psychomotor speed (71).\n\nFew studies have evaluated the pro-cognitive effects of\nother antidepressants for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction\nin MDD, with the exception of vortioxetine. Vortioxetine is\nan efficacious multimodal antidepressant that acts through a\ncombination of serotonin reuptake inhibition and receptor\n\nactivity. The efficacy of vortioxetine (10 or 20 mg/day) on\n\ncognition was evaluated in placebo-controlled study of adults\nbetween the ages of 18 and 65 with recurrent MDD and\na current depressive episode (72). In this study, cognition\nwas assessed using the DSST and RAVLT and significant\nimprovements in objective measures of executive function,\nattention, and processing speed as well as learning and memory\nwere described as a result of these assessments (72). The\nsubsequently compared to the efficacy of duloxetine. Similar\nto the previous study, the RAVLT and DSST were used to\nevaluate cognitive performance. Significant improvements on\nthe RAVLT were found in patients treated with duloxetine;\nhowever, significant improvements on both the RAVLT and\nDSST were found in patients treated with vortioxetine (73).\nThe foregoing observation of differential effects on cognition\ncould be mediated by the different mechanisms-of-action of\n\nin individuals receiving vortioxetine treatment (73). A recent\nmeta-analysis including nine placebo-controlled, randomized\ntrials demonstrated that vortioxetine had the greatest effects\non psychomotor speed, executive control, and cognitive control\namongst all antidepressants evaluated for cognitive effects in\nplacebo-controlled trials, whereas duloxetine had the greatest\neffect on delayed recall (74) Currently, vortioxetine is the only\npharmacological agent that has been approved for the treatment\nof MDD through specific targeting of cognitive dysfunction (75).\nAs of May 2018, the U.S. FDA has announced that vortioxetine\nhas demonstrated direct independent in clinically relevant\nimprovements in cognitive dysfunction in adults 18-65 with\nMDD. The EDA recognizes significant improvement in cognitive\nfunction in vortioxetine-treated individuals as measured by the\nDSST when compared to placebo. Vortioxetine product insert\nupdate to include this information represents that first time any\nanti-depressant has an explicit mention regarding pro-cognition\nin MDD. The use of vortioxetine for the treatment of MDD has\nadditionally been accepted by the European Medicines Agency.\nConvergent evidence has implicated ketamine as a rapid-\nacting antidepressant in subpopulations with MDD that do\nnot respond to conventional antidepressant therapies (76).\nCoincident with its use as an antidepressant in subanesthetic\ndoses, it has been suggested that ketamine may also improve\nneurocognitive symptoms in TRD.\n\n. It is a testable hypothesis that the anti-\nsuicide effects of ketamine are in part mediated by improvements\nin executive function (e.g., impulsivity) with ketamine treatment\n(82). However, the use of ketamine warrants further investigation\nfor its application in the treatment of cognitive symptoms in\npatients with MDD. Early improvements in cognition have also\nbeen suggested to predict the efficacy of ketamine for TRD,\nimplicating effects on cognition in the therapeutic mechanism of\nKetamine. In particular, lower levels of baseline neurocognitive\nperformance in individuals with TRD were correlated with an\nincreased antidepressant response to ketamine, as indicated by\na >50% reduction in MADRS scores (83).\n\nAdditional Agents\n\nErythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein secreted by the kidneys\nwhose main function is to stimulate red blood cell production\nin the bone marrow (84). In addition to its hematopoietic role,\nEPO has been found to play a role in the central nervous\nsystem and is essential for neurodevelopment, adult neurogenesis\nand neuroprotection. Hippocampal EPO exerts neuroprotective\nand neurotrophic effects that have been demonstrated to\nenhance cognitive performance in various disease models. When\nsystemically administered at therapeutic levels, EPO can cross the\n\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www. frontiersin.org\n\nDecember 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 655\n\n\nZuckerman et al.\n\nCognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorder\n\nblood-brain barrier and enhance cognitive function in healthy\n\ns\ng\ng\n=\n=\n\n\u00bb\n19\n3\n=a\ng\n2 ~\ng\n5\n2\n8\ng\na.\n&\nco\n2\n8\n\u00b0\n2\n2\n5\n1\nH\n8\n&\n3\n\u00ae\n=\ng\n=3\n8\n23\njo\nE\n\nadjunctive therapeutic option for cognitive improvement in\nMDD (87).\n\nOf note, the findings of\nthis meta-analysis may be limited by the quality of the data\nand methodological heterogeneity amongst studies.

Cognitive dysfunction in depression - pathophysiology\n\ninvolvement of insulin receptors in cognitive and emotional\nprocessing warrants further investigation.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nCognitive dysfunction is a core pathological feature of MDD\nthat is often overlooked and under-evaluated in the diagnosis\nand treatment of the disorder. It serves as a principal\nmediator of psychosocial and functionality outcomes, with\nimplications in workplace productivity and imminent return-\nto-work. Evaluation of both subjective and objective measures\nof cognition is imminent and relevant for improved functional\noutcomes in MDD.\n\nClassical therapeutic approaches to MDD are insufficient,\nwith poor existing response rates to first-, and even second-\nline antidepressant administration. While pharmacological\ntreatment avenues have focused primarily on the recovery\nof mood symptoms, the evidence indicates that remitted\npatients continue to exhibit clinically-significant cognitive\ndeficits that impact functional capacity. The inherent disconnect\nbetween mood remission and functional remission warrants the\ndevelopment of treatments that specifically target functionally-\nrelevant domains (i.e., cognition). Current clinical paradigms\nhave been insufficiently studied for their direct, independent,\nand clinically-significant effects on cognition. Vortioxetine is\ncurrently the only pharmacological agent approved for use in\nMDD that has been shown to exert direct and independent pro-\ncognitive effects. Disparate psychotherapeutic and adjunctive\nagents have been investigated from a precognitive perspective;\nhowever additional research is required to establish their\nindependent efficacies. Based on the evidence, the development\nof therapeutic strategies that directly target cognitive symptoms,\nin addition to mood symptoms, in MDD is may be required\nfor successful long-term remission and functional recovery\nin MDD.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nHZ: substantial contributions to the conception and design\nof the manuscript.
