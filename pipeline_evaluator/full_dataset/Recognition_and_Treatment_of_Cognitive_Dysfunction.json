Cognitiveimpairment has been observed to persist despite remission o f mood symptoms,suggesting dissociability of mood and cognitive symptoms i n MDD.

MDD is characterized by short- and/or long-term impairment a\ufb00ecting areasincluding,butnotlimitedto,mood,a\ufb00ect,motivation,andc ognition,andisfrequentlycorrelatedwith signi\ufb01cant reductions in quality of life and psychosocia l functioning ( 2). Despite therapeuticZuckerman et al. Cognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorderadvances in MDD, an estimated 70% of patients do not achieveremission following \ufb01rst-line antidepressant medication ( 3).Moreover, a signi\ufb01cant percentage of patients that successful lyachieve conventional symptomatic remission (i.e., reducti on intotal depressive symptom severity) do not return to premorbidfunctioning ( 4). The lack of full functional recovery resultsin decreased workplace functionality and productivity, furt hercontributing to the signi\ufb01cant economic burden imposed byMDD, with an accumulated annual loss of $43 billion in NorthAmerica( 5,6).Several regions of the brain, including the hippocampus,are negatively implicated in the pathophysiology MDD.Hippocampal size has been demonstrated to be inverselycorrelated with illness duration, whereby smaller hippocampa lsizes have been associated with more severe histories ofdepression ( 7). Size has also been shown to be in\ufb02uenced bythe number of past hospitalizations and recurrence of thedisorder. Frequent, chronic and lengthy states of depressio nimpart impairing e\ufb00ects on brain function, debasing humancapital. Without adequate treatment, brain recovery maybe compromised, resulting in negative downstream e\ufb00ectson the global functional outcomes in MDD. Amongst thedisparate domains a\ufb00ected in depression, cognition is themost relevant dimension related to the loss of human capital.While MDD treatment e\ufb00orts have focused on clinicallyobserved symptomatic targets including depressed mood andanhedonia, emerging evidence has dissociated symptomaticimprovement in these domains from functional improvementand timely return-to-work ( 8). The foregoing transitionhighlights the necessity for novel targets more closely ass ociatedwith the restoration of premorbid psychosocial functioning.Toward this aim, cognitive dysfunction has emerged as a keymediator subserving adverse functional impairment in MDD(9\u201312).Cognition is a nons-peci\ufb01c term that refers to mentalprocesses associated with thinking, learning, and memory ( 13).Cognitive dysfunction can be de\ufb01ned as a transnosologicaldomain serving as an essential mediator of disparate mentaldisorders ( 14). Clinical presentation of MDD, as de\ufb01ned bythe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5), includes cognitive impairment as acriterion item of a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) ( 15). Self-reportedmeasuresofdiminishedconcentrationandattentio narefrequently observed in individuals presenting with MDE as partofMDD.Moreover,whentreatingMDD,cognitiveimpairmentsare often found to persist during periods of symptomaticremission ( 14), supporting the disconnect between emotionaland functional improvement. While cognitive symptoms mayindirectly improve as a consequence of standard antidepressa ntcare, cognitive dysfunction is believed to be a core disturb ancein subsets of adults with MDD, independent of moodsymptoms( 16).MDD fundamentally alters one\u2019s perception and interactionwith their surrounding environment, a\ufb00ecting not only thesocial environment but also information and intellectualprocessing. Insu\ufb03ciency surrounding remission outcomesamongst individuals with MDD delineates the importanceof novel identi\ufb01cation and optimization in recognition andtreatment avenues. Successful outcomes rely on a heightene dfocus encompassing the needs of the patient, the provider, andsocietal perspectives. Recent developments have thus begun touncovertherelevanceofcognitionasaclinicalpriority.Hit herto,disturbances in cognitive function have been undermined intheir signi\ufb01cance in MDD relative to other psychiatric disorde rpopulations, however, accumulating evidence indicates thata disturbance in cognitive function represents a principaldeterminant of health outcomes in subsets of MDD patients.Cognitive dysfunction in MDD is common, pervasive acrossmultiple subdomains of cognitive function, and provides aprincipal determinant of health outcomes with respect to thepatient, as well as the societal perspectives. Herein, the curr entnarrative review will provide an up-to-date summary of theliterature pertaining to the domain of cognitive function inMDD. The current review aims to provide a framework forthe conceptualization of cognition in MDD, with particularfocus on the relevance, measurements, and treatment strate giesexplicatingdepressionasaprogressivecognitivedisorder.METHODSTheauthorsconductedanarrativereviewofstudiesinvesti gatingcognition as a relevant aspect of Major Depressive Disorder.Studies were identi\ufb01ed using PubMed/Medline and GoogleScholar from inception to June 2018. MDD(and/or variants)was cross-referenced with the following search terms: cognition,cognitive dysfunction, cognitive de\ufb01cit, cognitive functio n,functional outcomes, antidepressants, andtreatment . Articlesinformed by observational studies, clinical trials, and revi ewarticles relevant to cognition and cognitive impairment inMDD were included. Additionally, the search was augmentedthrough manual review of related terms and citations fromarticlereferencelists.Domains of CognitionCognition and emotion are interconnected processesoriginating from large interacting networks of neuronswithin the brain. In recent decades, interdisciplinary \ufb01eld sincluding neurophysiology, and cognitive psychology haveshed light on the neural underpinnings of various cognitivefunctions and processes; however, the current understandin gof these phenomena remains rudimentary. Cognition ismultidimensional and lacks a singular consensually agreedupon taxonomy. Several typologies have been proposed forthe de\ufb01nition and operationalization of cognitive construct s.Amongst these is the conventional typology distinguishingcognitive aspects into four main domains\u2014namely executivefunction, attention/concentration, learning/memory, an dprocessing speed ( 17). The aforementioned domains areinterconnected yet distinct phenomena. An additional propose dtypology was introduced by the RDoC which, although notlimited to cognitive domains, it emphasizes disturbances acro ssmultiple cognitive subdomains ( 18,19). Moreover, the literaturehas further proposed a clinically relevant taxonomy with twodistinct domains\u2014namely, \u201ccold\u201d cognition and \u201chot\u201d cogni tionFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 2 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 655Zuckerman et al. Cognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorder(20) (Table1). By de\ufb01nition, \u201ccold\u201d cognition refers to non-emotional information processing; therefore, these cognit iveprocesses occur in the absence of emotional engagement and/o rmotivation.\u201cCold\u201dcognitiveprocessesareusedintheevalu ationof neuropsychological function in depression ( 20) and generallyinclude the following subdomains of cognition: executivefunction, learning and memory, attention and concentratio n,and processing speed. Examples of commonly administeredobjective neuropsychological tests include the Rey AuditoryVerbal Learning Test (RAVLT) (e.g., acquisition and recall ),Trail-Making Test A/B (TMT A/B TMT A: processing speedTMT B: processing speed, executive function i.e., set shifting ),and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST processing speed,executive function, learning and memory, attention, andconcentration) ( 12). In contrast, \u201chot\u201d cognition refers toemotionally-laden cognitive processes; these functions ar ein\ufb02uenced by the individual\u2019s emotional state and may inclu denegative attentional bias, emotionally-linked recall, ru mination,and anhedonia ( 20). However, it is important to note that theweighted signi\ufb01cance and distinction between \u201chot\u201d and \u201cco ld\u201dcognition in depressed individuals is non-discrete and ther e aremanyoverlappingfeaturesbetweenthetwoconstructs( 20,21).Neuropsychological testing reveals important inferences in todisruptive pathophysiology of neural brain networks withdirect consequences on \u201ccold\u201d cognitive functioning. Neur alnetworks including the prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyru s,subcortical regions in the striatum and thalamus, and tempor allobe structures including the amygdala and hippocampus arefound to be functionally altered in depressive states ( 22).More speci\ufb01cally, de\ufb01cits in executive functioning have beenassociated with pathophysiology in the lateral aspects of theprefrontal cortex. Additionally, memory impairment has beenevidenced to be associated with reductions in hippocampalvolume which may be a progressive consequence of MDD ( 22).The circuitry of these structures has formed the targetedba sis ofvariousestablishedtreatmentsfordepression,however,cu rrentlyavailable treatments are not e\ufb00ective in all cases and requir esfurther understanding into the cognitive de\ufb01cits and neura lmarkerscharacterizingMDD.MDD as a Cognitive DisorderCognitive de\ufb01cits in MDD are consistent, replicable, non-speci\ufb01c, and clinically signi\ufb01cant. As cognition comprises a nimportant phenomenological domain of MDD, abnormalitiesin cognition may be used as a prognostic indicator foridentifying at-risk individuals and/or assessing disease onsetand progression. Manifestation of cognitive de\ufb01cits areTABLE 1 | Hot and cold cognitive processes.Hot cognition Cold cognitionRumination Executive functionEmotional processing Processing speedAnhedonia (reward processing) Learning and memoryAttentional bias Attention and concentrationheterogeneousacrossindividualswithMDDandvarydependingondisparateindividual-andillness-speci\ufb01cfactors.Forexa mple,the magnitude of cognitive de\ufb01cits has been demonstrated tobe proportionate to the frequency of depressive episodes andduration of illness ( 7,12). In keeping with this, individuals withgreater depressive symptom severity are more likely to presentwith cognitive impairments as compared to those with milderillness severity ( 12). Moreover, a systematic review evaluatingclinical progression in a\ufb00ective disorders, including MDD,suggested that cognitive function is associated with the du rationandnumberofpriorepisodes( 23).Unipolardepressionhasalsobeenfoundtobeassociatedwithanincreasedriskofdevelopi ngdementia,commonlyunderstoodastheendstageofprogressio nofcognitivedisturbances( 23).It is important to note that available studies often includehighly heterogeneous populations. This is an importantconsideration as there are various co-determinants ofcognitive function in MDD that may exact mediational and/ormoderational e\ufb00ects alongside illness severity and duratio n. Forexample, the presence of co-morbid medical and/or psychiatricconditions may exert direct e\ufb00ects on cognitive function andperformance ( 24,25). Metabolic co-morbidities, such as obesity,have also been associated with cognitive impairments and arecommonly observed in depressed individuals ( 26). In particular,studies have suggested that obesity is correlated with sign i\ufb01cantde\ufb01cits in executive functions such as working memory,planning, and executive control ( 24). In addition, factors suchas age (27), age at onset of depression ( 28), level of education(29), MDD subtype ( 30), in\ufb02ammatory status ( 31), treatmentregimen ( 32), and childhood adversity ( 33) have also beendemonstrated to in\ufb02uence cognitive performance in patientspresenting with MDD ( Figure1). Signi\ufb01cant impairments incognitive domains have been reported to precede, occur during ,and follow an illness episode; therefore, the temporality and/o rcausality of the association between cognitive impairment a ndMDEs remains elusive. Although scarce, studies have evaluat edcognitive dysfunction as a risk factor for the developmentof MDD. In a population study evaluating non-depressedindividuals between 20 and 64 years of age found that lowepisodic memory performance was a reliable predictor ofdepression 3 years post-diagnosis ( 34). Moreover, a separatestudy evaluating longitudinal pro\ufb01les of depressive symptomsin a birth cohort found that depression is associated withneurodevelopmental impairments which may be mediated bycognition( 35).Moreover,cognitivefunctioningmayalsobeusedas a predictor of treatment response. In a recently conductedsystematic review of studies evaluating early cognitive ch ange asapredictoroftreatmentresponseinindividualswithMDD( n=7), early changes in cognitive functioning were demonstrated tohaveapredictivee\ufb00ectontreatmentresponse.Morespeci\ufb01cally,theresultsdenotedatrendtowardearlychangesinhotcogni tiveprocesses (i.e., changed in facial emotion recognition) as apredictorofresponseinMDDpharmacotherapy( 36).Clinically,cognitionhasbeenclassi\ufb01edintofoursubdomain s:(1) learning and memory, ( 2) attention and concentration,(3) executive function, and ( 4) processing speed.

Notwithstanding,these reported measures are limited in that they do notnecessarily take into consideration subjective cognitive de\ufb01cits;for example, they may underreport de\ufb01cits in those individualswhose cognitive performance remains above the mean, butwho report de\ufb01cits in comparison to their baseline level ofcognitive function. While MDD does not decrease overallmeasures of intelligence, cognitive performance across theaforementioned domains have been shown to be severelya\ufb00ected, with e\ufb00ect sizes ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 ( 14,38).Cognitive Impairment in MDD and its Rolein Psychosocial Workplace FunctioningCognitive impairment has been reported to a\ufb00ect functionindependent of mood symptoms, and has been correlatedwith functional impairments. The evidence suggests that sel ectsymptom domains, such as cognition, may be of greaterrelevance to overall health outcomes ( 39). Neurocognitivede\ufb01cits in this population are directly related to impairedworkplace performance, and have signi\ufb01cantly contributedto the overall costs associated with depressive illness ( 12).Individuals with moderate to severe depression have beendemonstrated to experience increased rates of unemployment,disability, and absenteeism from work ( 40). Reductions inworkplace productivity and performance has been shown tobe mediated by cognitive impairments. For example, one studythat evaluated the relationship between depression and rolefunctioning using a population survey found that impairmentsinattentionandconcentrationmediatedtheassociationbe tweendepression and impaired role functioning ( 9). In addition, apost-hocanalysis of data from 260 participants enrolled in theInternational Mood Disorders Collaborative Project (IMDCP)found that in a subpopulation of working adults (18\u201365years of age) diagnosed with MDD, cognitive function was agreaterdeterminantofoverallworkplaceperformancethanto taldepression symptom severity ( 41). These observations suggestthat cognitive dysfunction is a principal mediator of functio nalimpairment and highlights their relevance in the evaluation andmanagementofoutcomesinMDD.Replicated evidence indicates that disturbances in cognitivefunction are common both during, and residually following,an acute MDE ( 12,42). Moreover, despite depressive symptomremission, individuals have reported continued de\ufb01cits incognitive function, which have negative e\ufb00ects on globalfunction,workplaceproductivity/performanceandqualityof life(41).Forexample,astudyfoundthatpatientswhowerecurrentlyin a state of remission and who met ICD-10 criteria for formerMDDexperiencedpersistentcognitivede\ufb01citscomparedtoage-,gender-,andeducation-matchedcontrolsubjects( 42).Althoughcontinued research is required to determine which cognitiv ede\ufb01cits persist following mood remission, there appears to bedocumented de\ufb01cits in the domains of attention and executiv eperformancewhencomparedtohealthycontrols( 42\u201344).Measurement and Screening of CognitiveFunctionHitherto,acomprehensive \u201cgoldstandard\u201d measure of cognit ivefunction in MDD with broad conceptual coverage, sensitivityto change, and immune from practice e\ufb00ects does not yetexist. Limitations of conventional clinical assessment mea sures[e.g., Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), MADRS] aresuboptimal insofar as they contain insu\ufb03cient items assessi ngcognitive function. Moreover, they are subjective in natureand have been shown to have minimal correlation withFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 4 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 655Zuckerman et al. Cognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorderobjective measures of cognition ( 39). Subjective cognition isoften in\ufb02uenced by emotional state, and consequently may bea\ufb00ected by the severity of depressive symptoms to a greaterextentthanobjectivemeasuresofcognition.Therefore,al thoughsubjective measures provide an accurate report of perceivedcognitive function, it does not necessarily formulate an ac curatemeasure of objective cognitive ability. In clinical practic e, avast array of neurocognitive tests have been employed forthe measurement and evaluation of cognitive impairmentsin MDD [e.g., DSST, TMT, Perceived De\ufb01cits Questionnaire(PDQ)]. These conventional instruments are routinely used andfrequentlyadministeredfortheassessmentofcognitivefu nction;however, they were not speci\ufb01cally developed or tailored toevaluateMDD-speci\ufb01ccognitivede\ufb01cits.Limitations related to the accessibility, cost-e\ufb00ectivene ss, andecological validity of standard tools for measuring cognit ionin MDD need to be addressed for the improvement of healthoutcomes in MDD. The THINC-integrated tool (THINC-it)is a recently validated, computerized cognitive assessmentbattery that screens both objective and subjective cogniti vede\ufb01cits in MDD ( 45). The THINC-it tool was validated asa sensitive tool in detecting and quantifying the magnitudeof cognitive de\ufb01cits in adults between the ages of 18 and 65with MDD ( 45). It e\ufb00ectively evaluates objective measuresof cognition through the inclusion of adaptations of fourvalidated tests (i.e., N-Back/Symbol Check, DSST/Codebre aker,TMT-B/Trails, and CRT/Spotter). These tasks accurately asse sscognitive subdomains including working memory, visuospati alcoordination,setshifting,andpsychomotorspeed.Addition ally,subjective measures of cognition are evaluated through thePerceived De\ufb01cits Questionnaire (PDQ-5). Compared totraditional pen-and-paper based cognitive measures such asthe DSST, TMT-B and PDQ-5-D, the tool has greater temporalreliability and concurrent validity ( 45). It is important tonote, however, that there are not clear cut-o\ufb00 criteria orprecise values for the individual tests that would enhanceits use in both diagnosis and treatment response clinically.To our knowledge, the THINC-it is the \ufb01rst freely availablecomputerized tool for screening cognitive dysfunction in MDD .Otherdevelopedmethodsforscreeningcognitivedysfunctio ninMDDincludetheScreenforCognitiveImpairmentinPsychiatry(SCIP-D) and the Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar DisorderAssessment (COBRA). The SCIP-D and COBRA have beenvalidated as methods to assess objective and subjective cog nitiveimpairment in MDD, respectively ( 46). While the COBRA haspoorer sensitivity and speci\ufb01city for the detection of object ivedysfunction as compared to the SCIP-D, the SCIP-D has greatersensitivity and speci\ufb01city for objective dysfunction; ther efore,the COBRA can be used in combination with the SCIP-D toincrease sensitivity and speci\ufb01city for the detection of obj ectivedysfunctioninMDD( 46).Treatment Interventions TargetingCognitive Dysfunction in MDDThe evaluation of subsyndromal depressive symptoms (SSD) inpatients with MDD is relevant for both treatment selection andoutcome.ThepresenceofSSDhasbeenshowntobesigni\ufb01cantlyassociated with disability and functional impairments in ol deradults (47). The pertinence of cognitive dysfunction in MDDunderscores the critical importance of developing treatmentmodalities that are capable of directly and/or indirectlyimproving cognitive function. Classical pharmacologicalantidepressant therapy aims to achieve symptomatic remissionby targeting mood symptoms; however, residual impairmentsin cognition that are not su\ufb03ciently targeted may imposenegative e\ufb00ects on workplace performance and productivityor delay a timely return to work. Targeted treatment ofcognitive impairments in MDD may capitalize on modi\ufb01abledeterminants,focusingonpreventionandpre-emption.Cognitive Remediation and Cognitive TherapyPsychological methods have been proposed for the treatmentand management of neurocognitive impairments in disparateneuropsychiatricconditionsincludingMDD( 48).Brainimagingevidence in MDD reveals a pattern of increased activity in thelimbic system coincident with decreased activity in execut iveareas of the brain ( 49). Cognitive remediation (CR) is apsychosocial approach aimed at relieving cognitive impairment sin individuals with diverse brain disorders including, but no tlimited to, attention de\ufb01cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. Cognitiveremediation involves the use of behavioral strategies to exe rta bene\ufb01cial e\ufb00ect across a broad range of functionally-relev antdomains (e.g., psychosocial skills). It has been used for thetreatment of maladaptive cognitive thought patterns that areprevalent in MDD. Cognitive training has e\ufb00ects on brainstructure and function, and has demonstrated e\ufb00ects onneurobiological systems adversely a\ufb00ected in mood disorderssuchasschizophrenia)( 50).Althoughstrongempiricalevidenceexists for the use of CR in patients with schizophrenia, fewstudies have been conducted evaluating the e\ufb03cacy of CR inhomogeneous samples of unipolar depressed individuals. Whenused as an adjunctive therapy in patients with MDD ( n=12), CR was found to signi\ufb01cantly improve cognitive function(i.e., attention, verbal learning and memory, psychomotorspeed, and executive function) compared to patients whowere not receiving adjunctive CR ( 50). The neuropsychologicaleducational approach to remediation (NEAR) has been usedas a method of CR that focuses on aspects of motivationand learning. NEAR involves the delivery of individually-tailored and commercially available computer games in agroup setting; the games are tailored to an individual\u2019sstrengths and weaknesses to promote learning via positivereinforcement ( 51). Signi\ufb01cant improvements in cognitivefunction, particularly verbal memory, have been found inpatients with MDD receiving NEAR in addition to routinetherapy, as compared to patients receiving only routine therapyR. S. C. ( 51\u201353). Although theoretically promising, moreevidence is required to suggest that CR is e\ufb00ective for thelong-term treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD ( 14).Additional considerations for the improvement and validityof CR for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDDinclude consistency with regard to task selection (i.e., de gree ofFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 5 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 655Zuckerman et al. Cognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorderdi\ufb03culty across studies), treatment frequency, and genera lizablemeasurements.Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a well-studied andpropitioustherapeuticavenueforthetreatmentandmanagemen tofcognitivedysfunctioninMDD.TheuseofCBTincombinationwith pharmacotherapy in adult depression has been shown totarget primarily hot cognitive processes and be more e\ufb00ectivethan pharmacotherapy alone ( 54). Notwithstanding, there area number of patients that do not successfully respond to CBT(55). Consequently, studies have aimed to investigate varioussubtypes and pathoetiology of depression with the goal ofinforming possible predictors of treatment response. Severalstudies have suggested that abnormalities in medial prefron talcortex(MPFC)( 56)andtheanteriorcingulatecortex(ACC)( 57)may contribute to the cognitive impairments observed in MDD.For example, a study found that following CBT treatment, thefunctional connectivity between MPFC-ACC was signi\ufb01cantlyreduced. Moreover, symptomatic improvement was positivelycorrelatedwithachangeinMPFC-ACCfunctionalconnectivit y,(58) suggesting that CBT could potentially be e\ufb00ective as aprecognitiveintervention.NeurostimulationNeurostimulation methods have been shown to be highlye\ufb00ective in the treatment of depression. For example,electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a neurostimulation meth odthat has been demonstrated to be e\ufb03cacious in the acutetreatment of depression ( 59). Negative neurocognitive biasrepresentsacentricfeatureofmajordepressionthatisassoc iatedwith signi\ufb01cant risk of relapse ( 60), with evidence highlightingnegativefaceprocessingpersistingintoperiodsofremission (61).Previous research provides evidence for various antidepress antsas rapid modulators of cognitive and neural emotional faceprocessing, prior to symptom improvement ( 62,63). Contrarytothis,compoundslackingantidepressante\ufb03cacyhavenoe\ufb00ecton emotional bias ( 63). The capacity of ECT as a modulatorof neurocognitive response to emotional information hasrecently been studied. In the \ufb01rst conducted double-blind,sham-controlled, parallel-group study, the e\ufb00ect of a singleECT session on the neurocognitive response to emotionalinformationinMDDwasevaluated.Theresultsrevealedchang esin parahippocampal and superior frontal responses to fearful vs.happy faces, as well as in fear-speci\ufb01c functional connectivit ybetween amygdala and occipito-temporal regions in responseto single-session ECT treatment ( 64). Although no statisticallysigni\ufb01cant shift in the neural response to faces was observedfollowingECT,thetrendissuggestiveofearlyshiftsinemot ionalprocessing that contribute to the antidepressant activity ofECT(64).Despite its promising use in the reversal of heightenedneurocognitive response in MDD, the use of ECT is prejudiceddue to reports of cognitive impairments following individualtreatment. Some patients report acute disorientation andcognitive de\ufb01cits, with uncertainty surrounding the durat ionof the short- and long-term cognitive de\ufb01cits. In a meta-analysis of 84 studies and 2,981 patients that aimed to evalua tethe cognitive impairments following ECT, signi\ufb01cant cognit iveimpairments (i.e., in verbal and visual episodic memory andexecutive function) were identi\ufb01ed in depressed patients wit hin3daysoftreatment.However,thesede\ufb01citsincognitivefun ctionfollowing ECT did not persist beyond 15 days post-treatment,with small to medium e\ufb00ect sizes of improvement for mostvariables (i.e., processing speed, verbal working memory, an dexecutivefunction)( 59).More recently, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation(rTMS) has emerged as a neurostimulation method forimproving neurocognitive function in patients with MDD, andis generally viewed more favorably due to its less invasivenature and diminished propensity for cognitive impairment(65). A systematic review analyzing the role of rTMS inimproving neurocognition in patients with treatment-resista ntdepression (TRD) found that the majority of studies supportan association between rTMS and improved neurocognitivee\ufb00ects (66). Much of the literature focuses on the dorsolateralprefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as a target for rTMS as it is a critica lbrain region for neurocognitive performance ( 67). Stimulationof the DLPFC through rTMS has been shown to producevariable improvements in psychomotor speed, attention, verba l\ufb02uency,executivefunction,andotherworkingmemorydomai nsin patients with TRD ( 66). The foregoing evidence suggestspotential procognitive e\ufb00ects following neurostimulation viarTMS. However, it remains to be determined whether rTMSand/or other neurostimulation techniques can reliably ande\ufb00ectivelyamelioratecognitivedysfunctioninMDD.PharmacotherapyThe counterintuitive gap between remission from depressivesymptoms and functional recovery warrants the evaluation oftherapeutic avenues targeted at improving cognitive symptomsin individuals with MDD. Notwithstanding the currentneed for novel targets to facilitate symptomatic remissioncoincident with functional productivity and timely return-to-work, pharmacotherapies have been scarcely evaluated fortheir direct and independent e\ufb00ects on cognition in MDD.Individuals with MDD routinely receive interventions [e.g. ,selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin andnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamineoxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), antipsychotics] with potentiallyadverse e\ufb00ects on cognitive measures ( 20). Persistent functionalimpairments mediated by cognitive dysfunction in individua lswith MDD warrants the identi\ufb01cation of pharmacotherapieswithpro-cognitivee\ufb00ects.Determinationofthemagnitudeofe\ufb00ectofanantidepressanton cognitive function has posed signi\ufb01cant limitations as stu dydesigns and assessment methodologies are not standardized i nimplementation.Notwithstandingtheseinconsistenciesamo ngststudies,certainpharmacotherapieshavedemonstratedbene\ufb01c iale\ufb00ects on cognitive measures of individuals with MDD. Asystematic review and meta-analysis that aimed to evaluatethe overall e\ufb00ect of antidepressants on cognitive function inMDD revealed that SSRIs/SNRIs have more bene\ufb01cial e\ufb00ects onmemory domains compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) ,but exhibit equivalent e\ufb00ects on working memory comparedto norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) [60].Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 6 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 655Zuckerman et al. Cognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive DisorderWithin the class of SSRIs, sertraline was found to havemore bene\ufb01cial e\ufb00ects on psychomotor speed compared to\ufb02uoxetine60. However, the results from this meta-analysis werelimitedbysmallsamplesizesandlargeheterogeneityincogn itivetesting which prevented pooling of e\ufb00ect sizes for a singledomain.Improvedstandardizationofcognitiveassessmentt oolswouldbebene\ufb01cialforfuturetrialsevaluatingcognitivem easuresinMDD.Duloxetine is an FDA-approved SNRI antidepressantmedication. An imbalance or de\ufb01ciency in serotonin and/ornorepinephrine system function has been associated withcognitive de\ufb01cits ( 68), providing the rationale for the use ofSNRIs for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD. Astudy comparing cognitive function following either duloxet ineor escitalopram treatment found that duloxetine resulted ingreater improvements in declarative and working memorycompared to escitalopram ( 69). Moreover, a double-blind,placebo-controlled trial involving elderly patients (ages 6 5 andolder) with recurrent MDD found that 8-week treatment withduloxetine resulted in a signi\ufb01cant improvement in compositemeasures of cognition compared to placebo. In this study, thecompositecognitivescorewasmediatedlargelybyimprovemen tin verbal learning and memory ( 70). Duloxetine has also beenassessed as a pro-cognitive antidepressant in young- to middl e-aged subpopulations with MDD. For example, in a 12-weekopen-label trial, duloxetine was found to signi\ufb01cantly impro vecognitivefunction,particularlypsychomotorspeed( 71).Few studies have evaluated the pro-cognitive e\ufb00ects ofother antidepressants for the treatment of cognitive dysfun ctionin MDD, with the exception of vortioxetine. Vortioxetine isan e\ufb03cacious multimodal antidepressant that acts through acombination of serotonin reuptake inhibition and receptoractivity. The e\ufb03cacy of vortioxetine (10 or 20 mg/day) oncognition was evaluated in placebo-controlled study of adult sbetween the ages of 18 and 65 with recurrent MDD anda current depressive episode ( 72). In this study, cognitionwas assessed using the DSST and RAVLT and signi\ufb01cantimprovements in objective measures of executive function,attention, and processing speed as well as learning and memorywere described as a result of these assessments ( 72). Thee\ufb03cacyofvortioxetineinimprovingcognitioninelderlypati ents(>65 years of age) with MDD has also been evaluated, andsubsequently compared to the e\ufb03cacy of duloxetine. Similarto the previous study, the RAVLT and DSST were used toevaluate cognitive performance. Signi\ufb01cant improvements onthe RAVLT were found in patients treated with duloxetine;however, signi\ufb01cant improvements on both the RAVLT andDSST were found in patients treated with vortioxetine ( 73).The foregoing observation of di\ufb00erential e\ufb00ects on cognitioncould be mediated by the di\ufb00erent mechanisms-of-action ofthe two drugs. Vortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressanthypothesized to exert its e\ufb00ects via its action on the serotoni nreuptake transporter inhibition and cell surface serotonerg ivreceptors (e.g., 5HT3 and 5HT7). In comparison to duloxetine,the activity of vortioxetine as a 5-HT 1Areceptor stimulator and5-HT3receptor antagonist may enhance cortical glutamatergicneuronal \ufb01ring contributing to improved cognitive performan cein individuals receiving vortioxetine treatment ( 73). A recentmeta-analysis including nine placebo-controlled, randomiz edtrials demonstrated that vortioxetine had the greatest e\ufb00ec tson psychomotor speed, executive control, and cognitive contr olamongst all antidepressants evaluated for cognitive e\ufb00ects i nplacebo-controlled trials, whereas duloxetine had the great este\ufb00ect on delayed recall ( 74) Currently, vortioxetine is the onlypharmacological agent that has been approved for the treatmentofMDDthroughspeci\ufb01ctargetingofcognitivedysfunction( 75).AsofMay2018,theU.S.FDAhasannouncedthatvortioxetinehas demonstrated direct independent in clinically relevantimprovements in cognitive dysfunction in adults 18\u201365 withMDD.TheFDArecognizessigni\ufb01cantimprovementincognitivefunction in vortioxetine-treated individuals as measured by theDSST when compared to placebo. Vortioxetine product insertupdate to include this information represents that \ufb01rst time a nyanti-depressant has an explicit mention regarding pro-cognit ionin MDD. The use of vortioxetine for the treatment of MDD hasadditionallybeenacceptedbytheEuropeanMedicinesAgency.Convergent evidence has implicated ketamine as a rapid-acting antidepressant in subpopulations with MDD that donot respond to conventional antidepressant therapies ( 76).Coincident with its use as an antidepressant in subanestheti cdoses, it has been suggested that ketamine may also improveneurocognitive symptoms in TRD. Despite concerns regardingthee\ufb00ectofketamineoncognition,replicatedevidenceinhea lthycontrols has shown that ketamine does not impair recall forpreviously learned information( 77,78), and no impairments inexecutivefunctionhavebeenassociatedwithketaminetrea tment(79,80). Additionally, in a subpopulation of TRD patients,ketamine was found to signi\ufb01cantly reduce explicit suicidalideation, as compared to the psychoactive placebo-control,midazolam( 81).These\ufb01ndingssuggestthatketaminetreatmentmayexertbene\ufb01ciale\ufb00ectsonmeasuresofexecutivefunction ingin patients with TRD. It is a testable hypothesis that the anti-suicidee\ufb00ectsofketamineareinpartmediatedbyimprovementsinexecutivefunction(e.g.,impulsivity)withketaminetrea tment(82).However,theuseofketaminewarrantsfurtherinvestigat ionfor its application in the treatment of cognitive symptoms inpatients with MDD. Early improvements in cognition have alsobeen suggested to predict the e\ufb03cacy of ketamine for TRD,implicatinge\ufb00ectsoncognitioninthetherapeuticmechanismo fketamine. In particular, lower levels of baseline neurocogn itiveperformance in individuals with TRD were correlated with anincreased antidepressant response to ketamine, as indicated bya\u226550%reductioninMADRSscores( 83).Additional AgentsErythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein secreted by the kidneyswhose main function is to stimulate red blood cell productionin the bone marrow ( 84). In addition to its hematopoietic role,EPO has been found to play a role in the central nervoussystemandisessentialforneurodevelopment,adultneuroge nesisand neuroprotection.

Due to its procognitive e\ufb00ects, EPO has beeninvestigated as a treatment for the cognitive de\ufb01cits obser ved inTRD.

Studies have demonstrated that individualswith mild cognitive impairment who engage in regular exercis eexhibit greater improvements in memory compared to thosewho do not engage in regular exercise ( 89). In addition,studiesinhealthyparticipantshavedemonstratedimprovemen tsin psychomotor speed, attention, visual memory, and spatialplanningfollowingengagementinexercise.Onestudyfoundt hat30-min exercise augmentation was associated with signi\ufb01ca ntimprovements in executive control processing ( 87). In a meta-analysisevaluatingthee\ufb00ectsofexerciseoncognitivesympt omsin MDD, the researchers found no signi\ufb01cant procognitivee\ufb00ect of exercise ( 90); however, they did \ufb01nd that cognitivefunction was positively in\ufb02uenced by a combination of physica land cognitive activity as well as lower-intensity interven tionswith higher adherence rates ( 90). Of note, the \ufb01ndings ofthis meta-analysis may be limited by the quality of the dataand methodological heterogeneity amongst studies. Contin uedresearch that strati\ufb01es participants by the type of exerciseintervention and baseline characteristics (e.g., educati on level)is required to characterize the cognitive e\ufb00ects of exercise indepressedpopulations.Intranasalinsulinhasalsobeeninvestigatedasapro-cogni tiveagent in the treatment of mood and mental disorders. Forexample,cognitiveperformanceinbothAlzheimer\u2019sDisease( 91)and Bipolar Disorder ( 92) has been shown to improve followingtreatment with intranasal insulin. Insulin availability a nd/orinsulin receptor sensitivity has been implicated in MDD ( 93).Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated procogn itivee\ufb00ects of intranasal insulin across multiple subdomains ofcognition including learning and memory in both healthy anddisease a\ufb00ected populations ( 91,93). In a randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled,crossovertrial,althoughnosi gni\ufb01cantimprovements in neurocognitive function was observed withintranasal insulin treatment in individuals with MDD ( 94), theinvolvement of insulin receptors in cognitive and emotionalprocessingwarrantsfurtherinvestigation.CONCLUSIONCognitive dysfunction is a core pathological feature of MDDthat is often overlooked and under-evaluated in the diagnosisand treatment of the disorder. It serves as a principalmediator of psychosocial and functionality outcomes, withimplications in workplace productivity and imminent return-to-work. Evaluation of both subjective and objective measu resof cognition is imminent and relevant for improved functiona loutcomesinMDD.Classical therapeutic approaches to MDD are insu\ufb03cient,with poor existing response rates to \ufb01rst-, and even second-line antidepressant administration. While pharmacologicaltreatment avenues have focused primarily on the recoveryof mood symptoms, the evidence indicates that remittedpatients continue to exhibit clinically-signi\ufb01cant cogniti vede\ufb01citsthatimpactfunctionalcapacity.Theinherentdiscon nectbetween mood remission and functional remission warrants t hedevelopment of treatments that speci\ufb01cally target functiona lly-relevant domains (i.e., cognition). Current clinical paradi gmshave been insu\ufb03ciently studied for their direct, independent ,and clinically-signi\ufb01cant e\ufb00ects on cognition. Vortioxeti ne iscurrently the only pharmacological agent approved for use inMDD that has been shown to exert direct and independent pro-cognitive e\ufb00ects. Disparate psychotherapeutic and adjunctiveagents have been investigated from a precognitive perspective ;however additional research is required to establish theirindependent e\ufb03cacies. Based on the evidence, the developmentof therapeutic strategies that directly target cognitive sy mptoms,in addition to mood symptoms, in MDD is may be requiredfor successful long-term remission and functional recover yinMDD.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSHZ: substantial contributions to the conception and designof the manuscript.

Several studies have suggested that abnormalities in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) (56) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (57) may contribute to the cognitive impairments observed in MDD. For example, a study found that following CBT treatment, the functional connectivity between MPFC-ACC was significantl reduced.
