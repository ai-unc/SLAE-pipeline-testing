Rogers, PhD; Hong Chang, PhD;Leueen Lapitsky, MPH; Thomas McLaughlin, ScD; John Reed, MDAbstractPurpose. Depressed employees are vulnerable to adverse work outcomes. We hypothes ized that workperformance is impaired by depression and is worsened by exposure to psych osocial work stressors.Design. Longitudinal cohort study with surveys administered at baseline, 6, 12, and 18months.Setting. Recruitment in primary care offices.Subjects. A total of 14,268 were screened; 286 depressed, employed adults (18\u201362 years)and 193 controls were enrolled.Measures. At-work limitations (presenteeism) and absenteeism were measured with the WorkLimitations Questionnaire (WLQ) and WLQ Work Absence Module, respectively. Workstressors were assessed using a modified version of the Job Content Questionnaire.Analysis. Univariate and multivariate tests assessed the degree to which at-work limitationswere related to depression and/or stressful work.Results. Presenteeism and absenteeism were significantly worse for the depression group ateach time point (p #.001). In cross-sectional models, presenteeism was associated with moresevere depression symptoms, poorer general physical health, psychologically demanding work, theinteraction of psychologically demanding work with depression, and less job control (r2range5.33\u2013.54). Absences were explained by depression symptom severity and poorer general physicalhealth but not work stressors (r25.19). Because of minimal change in the work stressors, theirlongitudinal effects on outcomes were mostly nonsignificant.Conclusion. This study found that depression symptoms are related to work absences andimpaired work performance, and results partly confirmed that work stressors add to this impact.Results suggest that workers with depression may benefit from care involving medical andvocational interventions.

Work that islow in control involves constraineddecision latitude and skill discretion.The job strain model suggests thatthere is an interaction between de-mands and control, defining the so-called \u2018\u2018high-strain\u2019\u2019 jobs (high de-mands/low control) as most harmfuland the \u2018\u2018active\u2019\u2019 jobs (high demand/high control) as most healthful.

With some exceptions, ob-servational and intervention researchconfirms that job control is importantto health, but results are mixed forpsychological demands.15,16Studiesbased on competing models, such asthe Effort-Reward-Imbalance model,which addresses a dimension of fair-ness, have shown similar results.17This is the first study to investigatewhether work stressors influence theoutcome of workers who havedepression. We speculated that ademanding workload, lack of control,and/or unsupportive environmentmay contribute to functional andproductivity losses for the followingreasons: (1) it may be difficult fordepressed workers to make adjust-ments that could help them cope withdepression symptoms and impair-ments (e.g., varying the pace of workin relation to energy levels, going tomedical appointments, and/ormodifying job tasks) and/or (2) theresultant work stress may prolongsymptoms and impairments. Recentresearch documents that work stressis associated with depression.18\u201320Wehypothesized that, compared withnondepressed workers, those withdepression have more impaired workperformance and this impairment isfurther worsened by exposure topsychosocial work stressors (e.g.,high psychological demands, limitedcontrol, and/or insufficient socialsupport).METHODSDesignA longitudinal cohort study wasconducted in which the work outcomesof two groups of employed adults werecompared: a group with major depres-sion (MDD), dysthymia, or both(known as \u2018\u2018double depression\u2019\u2019[DD]),21\u201323and a group of healthycontrols. A third group with rheuma-toid arthritis was enrolled but is notincluded in this analysis.SampleThe study samples were recruitedbetween February 2001 and March2003. The institutional review boardsof all participating sites approved studyprotocols. After explanation of thestudy to eligible individuals, writteninformed consent was obtained. Thestudy included the following eligibilitycriteria: between 18 and 62 years ofage, working at least 15 hours perweek, English speaking and/or read-ing, not planning to retire within 2years, no current or pending disabilityand/or Worker\u2019s Compensation claim,no current alcoholism or drug abuse,no pregnancy or childbirth in the past6 months, and none of 13 disablingmedical conditions (e.g., angina, con-gestive heart failure, stroke, diabetes,chronic obstructive lung disease, andbipolar disorder). In addition, individ-uals qualifying for the depressiongroup had to screen-in for MDD and/or dysthymia. To be eligible for thecontrol group, the person had tohave no more than one depressionsymptom.Eligibility assessment involved thefollowing steps: (1) research assistants(RAs) in primary care physician (PCP)offices invited patients, except those inobvious discomfort, to complete a briefself-report screening survey; (2) thePCP was informed of the result andasked to confirm medical eligibility;(3) confirmed depressed patients anda 10% random sample of potentiallyeligible control patients were mailed abaseline questionnaire, consent form,and opt-out card; (4) if no opt-out cardwas returned, the RA called to explainthe study and ask additional eligibilityquestions (e.g., recent bereavementand the Patient Health Questionnaire(PHQ-9) depression items22,23). If apatient refused the interview or wasunreachable, a message was left invit-ing him or her to complete the hard-copy forms and send them back; and(5) eligible patients returning theirbaseline and consent forms were en-rolled. Each was asked to answer andreturn a postage-paid mail survey every6 months for 18 months. To encourageresponse, telephone and postcard re-minders, survey remailings, and mon-etary incentives ($20 for the baselineand $10 for each follow-up) were used.The PCP office screening survey wascompleted by 14,268 patients: 4124(29%) were ineligible, 8235 (58%)were healthy controls not needed forthe study, and 1909 (13%) were po-tentially eligible. Of the 1909, 437(23%) were ineligible based on physi-cian feedback (e.g., the patient had adisabling medical condition not previ-ously reported that excluded him/herfrom participating), 646 (34%) did notcomplete the screening procedure,and 826 (43%) were fully screened andeligible, including 716 for the depres-sion and healthy control groups (therest had rheumatoid arthritis and arenot included in this analysis). Of the716, a group of 237 (33%) declinedparticipation and 479 (67%) enrolled.The enrolled sample consisted of adepression group composed of 286adults with confirmed dysthymia(based on criteria from the Diagnosticand Statistical Manual Edition IV24)( n572), MDD (n 5105), or DD (n 5109), and a comparison group ofhealthy controls (n 5193).Based on screening results, studyparticipants were similar to those de-clining participation on mean age,mean general mental and generalphysical health (based on SF-12 mentaland physical component summaryscores,25respectively), and percentwith depression. A larger percentage ofstudy participants were male (p ,.001).Among participants, attrition wasgreater in the depression group com-pared with controls (12.5% vs. 6.6%;p5.04). Within the depression group,those who completed the study weresimilar to the dropouts on depressionsymptom severity (measured with thePHQ-9), mean age, gender, and meangeneral mental and general physicalhealth.MeasuresStudy outcomes were measured bythe Work Limitations Questionnaire(WLQ). The WLQ has been validatedfor employed samples with and withoutdepression.26\u201329The WLQ\u2019s four worklimitation scale scores and productivityloss score are presenteeism indicators.Each scale score indicates the percent-age of time in the prior 2 weeks thathealth problems limited the person\u2019sability to perform four types of worktasks: time management (five items),physical tasks (six items), mental-in-terpersonal tasks (nine items), andoutput tasks (e.g., handling the work-load and finishing work on time; fiveitems). Scores range from 0 (none ofthe time) to 100 (all of the time). The206 American Journal of Health PromotionFor individual use only. Duplication or distribution prohibited by law.summary at-work productivity lossscore is the weighted sum of the fourscale scores.30The WLQ\u2019s Work Absence Module(two items) measures the number ofhealth-related workdays missed in thepast 2 weeks (absences). Scores rangefrom 0 to 11 or more workdays.Productivity loss owing to absencesreflects the number of absences divid-ed by the number of days usuallyworked in a 2-week period.The validated Job Content Ques-tionnaire (JCQ),31modified slightly fora national survey, was used to measurepsychological demands (seven items),job control (five items),10and physicaldemands (five items), collectively re-ferred to as \u2018\u2018work stressors.\u2019\u2019 Scoresrange from 0 (low demands or control)to 100 (high demands or control).Objective measures of occupationaldemands were imputed from O*NET,32a national database (labeled the \u2018\u2018im-puted demands\u2019\u2019 variable). O*NETvariables describe occupational charac-teristics according to their level ofintensity and/or importance. Based onour prior depression research showingthat they were related to WLQ scores,9we elected to include 16 O*NET vari-ables describing demands for socialinteraction, concentration, judgment,and physical stamina.To create an imputed demandsvariable for each participant fromO*NET data, the following process wasused. With each survey administration,employed participants completedstandard open-ended questions abouttheir occupation. A study RA read eachanswer and assigned to it a Bureau ofthe Census occupational code.32Usingthe occupational code to link the studyand O*NET databases, 16 variablescores were assigned to each partici-pant. To facilitate analysis, we createdan O*NET summary score (the sum ofthe weighted raw scores for each of the16 O*NET variables with weights sup-plied by factor loadings from a princi-pal components factor analysis). Thesummary imputed demands score wasstandardized to a mean 50 andstandard deviation 51, with a higherscore reflecting greater demand forhigher-order cognitive and communi-cation skills (e.g., learning, problemsolving, judgment, decision making)vs. physical skills.Health variables included conditiongroup (depression group 51, controlgroup50), presence of depression(yes51, no50), based on a PHQ-9depression symptom count (0\u20134 symp-toms5not depressed, 5\u20139 symptoms5depressed), depression symptomseverity (also measured by the PHQ-9)ranging from a score of 0 (no symp-toms) to 27 (severe symptoms), cur-rently taking antidepressant medica-tion (yes 51, no50), general mentalhealth (based on the SF-12 MentalComponent Summary [MCS-12] score)and general physical health (based onthe SF-12 Physical Component Sum-mary [PCS-12] score) (each scored as10 for worst health to 70 for besthealth),25and number of comorbidchronic medical conditions (comor-bidities) (0\u20138 conditions).Demographics included continuousage, gender (female 51, male 50),marital status (married 51, notmarried 50), race/ethnicity (white 51; nonwhite 50), years of education(0\u201317), annual earnings, weekly workhours (observed range, 0\u201384), self-employment status (self-employed 51;not self-employed 50), years on the job(#1, 2\u20134, 5\u20139, and \u00a710), company size(,25 employees, 25\u201399, 100\u2013999, and\u00a71000), three dummy variables foroccupational group (professional, ad-ministrative, managerial, and technical;sales, service, and support; and repairs,construction, production, and trans-portation), and number of jobs heldsince age 18 (observed range, 1\u201311).AnalysisInitially we generated descriptivestatistics.

Forexample, the risk ratio of 3.6 for theWLQ time management scale at base-line means that the depression groupin general experienced about a 3.6times higher score than the controlgroup.Next we investigated the impact ofdepression and work stressors on theoutcomes (four work limitations scalescores and absences) using both cross-sectional and longitudinal multiplelinear regression models. Stata version7.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station,Texas) was used.33Models include only those partici-pants who were currently employedand had WLQ data. To reduce con-founding owing to changing occupa-tions, only the participants who stayedin their baseline occupation wereincluded. If a participant had stoppedworking or changed occupations, hisor her data were excluded from thatpoint forward.The cross-sectional analyses addressthe relationship between the outcomesof interindividual differences in workstressors. The longitudinal analysesaddress the relationship between thedifferences in intraindividual-levelchanges in work stressors on change inoutcome. Because occupation does notchange, the longitudinal analyses ruleout the possibility that change in thework outcomes is related to a changein employment.With 479 participants, the maximumnumber of cross-sectional observationswas 1916. Of these, we lost 277 (14%)to attrition, 330 (17%) to unemploy-ment or a new occupation, and 194(10%) to missing data on majorindependent variables. The final cross-sectional sample ranged from a maxi-mum of 1107 observations for theabsence model to 1080 for the timemanagement scale model. Of a maxi-mum 1437 longitudinal observations,losses related to attrition and employ-ment reduced the sample to 830(58%), and another 203 (14%) weremissing major independent variables,leaving a maximum analytic sample of613 and a minimum of 582. Themissing independent variables oc-curred because a shorter questionnairewas administered to participants whowere difficult to reach or late inTable 2Characteristics of the Sample bySurveyInterval and Change Over TimeMean (SD)RiskRatio pDepressionGroup /C192ControlGroup `Work stressorsPsychological demandsBaseline 67.9 (21.6) 64.8 (21.9) 1.05 0.136 mo 65.5 (22.4) 65.5 (20.9) 1.00 0.9912 mo 67.2 (22.9) 63.2 (20.5) 1.06 0.1718 mo 64.4 (23.7) 66.2 (19.9) 0.97 0.58Change over time p 0.53 0.74 \u2014 \u2014Per interval change 21.77 (17.30) 20.96 (15.54) \u2014 0.52Baseline to last available change 23.10 (17.81) 21.66 (17.01) \u2014 0.17Job controlBaseline 56.3 (21.9) 67.6 (19.8) 0.83 ,0.0016 mo 60.7 (21.3) 69.5 (19.0) 0.87 ,0.00112 mo 62.5 (21.8) 71.3 (17.8) 0.88 0.00118 mo 59.1 (22.5) 72.1 (18.3) 0.82 ,0.001Change over time p 0.05 0.18 \u2014 \u2014Per interval change 0.23 (16.02) 0.60 (13.72) \u2014 0.75Baseline to last available change 1.15 (17.81) 1.57 (17.18) \u2014 0.69Physical demandsBaseline 39.1 (29.7) 30.3 (26.0) 1.29 0.0016 mo 37.3 (30.0) 30.9 (26.6) 1.21 0.06112 mo 35.7 (26.3) 26.4 (24.7) 1.35 0.00618 mo 37.9 (27.0) 30.4 (26.5) 1.25 0.058Change over time p 0.76 0.49 \u2014 \u2014Per interval change 20.22 (17.19) 20.25 (14.10) \u2014 0.98Baseline to last available change 20.38 (17.71) 21.04 (16.37) \u2014 0.52Depression symptom severityBaseline 13.1 (5.5) 2.8 (2.9) 4.68 ,0.0016 mo 11.2 (5.5) 2.9 (3.3) 3.86 ,0.00112 mo 10.0 (5.9) 2.8 (3.3) 3.57 ,0.00118 mo 8.9 (5.4) 2.7 (3.0) 3.30 ,0.001Change over time p ,0.001 0.96 \u2014 \u2014Per interval change 21.44 (5.78) 0.01 (2.79) \u2014 ,0.001Baseline to last available change 22.82 (6.05) 20.001 (2.82) \u2014 ,0.001Work limitationsTime managementBaseline 35.5 (22.1) 9.8 (14.1) 3.62 ,0.0016 mo 28.1 (21.7) 9.1 (13.5) 3.09 ,0.00112 mo 27.7 (22.0) 11.3 (17.1) 2.45 ,0.00118 mo 26.5 (22.2) 8.4 (14.0) 3.15 ,0.001Change over time p ,0.001 0.44 \u2014 \u2014Per interval change 23.02 (21.29) 20.46 (16.27) \u2014 0.06Baseline to last available change 25.56 (20.87) 20.39 (15.18) \u2014 ,0.001Physical tasksBaseline 19.5 (20.3) 7.8 (16.7) 2.50 ,0.0016 mo 15.1 (19.9) 6.2 (14.4) 2.44 ,0.00112 mo 15.3 (19.0) 6.0 (12.0) 2.55 ,0.00118 mo 15.4 (21.1) 6.8 (11.8) 2.26 ,0.001Change over time p 0.06 0.67 \u2014 \u2014Per interval change 21.61 (20.85) 20.86 (17.30) \u2014 0.59Baseline to last available change 22.91 (20.78) 21.65 (17.45) \u2014 ,0.001Mental-interpersonal tasksBaseline 36.2 (19.7) 9.5 (14.3) 3.81 ,0.0016 mo 27.4 (19.2) 8.1 (11.4) 3.38 ,0.001208 American Journal of Health PromotionFor individual use only.

This short version didnot include the JCQ variables.Each multiple linear regressionmodel addresses one of the five out-comes (scores for the time manage-ment, physical, mental-interpersonal,and output scales, and absences). Thedependent variables for the cross-sec-tional models consist of the score at aspecific time point. For the longitudi-nal models, the outcomes reflect thedifference between a follow-up scoreand the next prior score. Each partic-ipant could have a maximum of fourtime points and three intervals.Models estimate the association be-tween an outcome and conditiongroup (depression vs. control), de-pression symptom severity, generalphysical health, work stressors, imput-ed demands score, and interactionterms for condition group by workstressor.The main effects for psychologicdemands, job control, and physicaldemands were centered to improve theaccuracy of the estimates for them.Models control for age, gender, andnumber of years on the job. Prelimi-nary regression analyses indicated thatvariables such as marital status, years ofeducation, and annual earnings didnot contribute significantly to themodels. A study site variable is notincluded because preliminary analysesindicated that it was not significant. Toaddress the possibility of selectingparticipants with pre-existing workdifficulties, models control for thebaseline value of the dependent vari-able. Regression results are reported asbetas, confidence intervals, and pvalues. Clustering is used for thelongitudinal models to account for thecorrelation in successive observations.Preliminary tests were conducted toevaluate whether the work stressorresponses were biased by depression.In a series of linear regression models,scores for psychological demands, jobcontrol, supervisor and coworker sup-port (from the JCQ), and physicaldemands were regressed on a condi-tion group indicator and depressionsymptom severity score, general physi-cal health score (PCS-12), and imputeddemands score, adjusting for age,gender, and years on the job. Cross-sectional and longitudinal models weretested. If a depression variable wassignificantly related to a self-reportwork scale, then the scale\u2019s items wereanalyzed. Items significantly related todepression were removed from furtheranalysis, and only the remaining scalevariables were rescored (TechnicalAppendix available from authors).The social support variables (super-visor and coworker support) weresignificantly related to depression aswere four psychological demands scaleitems (excessive work, enough time,conflicting demands, and hectic job).These items were excluded from allfurther analyses.RESULTSCompared with controls (Table 1),the depression group was younger (p 5.03), had a higher percentage ofMean (SD)RiskRatio pDepressionGroup /C192ControlGroup `12 mo 26.2 (19.7) 8.8 (13.1) 2.98 ,0.00118 mo 25.1 (20.9) 7.5 (10.4) 3.35 ,0.001Change over time p ,0.001 0.56 \u2014 \u2014Per interval change 24.3 (20.22) 0.60 (13.12) \u2014 0.003Baseline to last available change 27.37 (20.42) 21.28 (16.87) \u2014 ,0.001Output tasksBaseline 36.4 (25.1) 8.4 (14.7) 4.33 ,0.0016 mo 24.6 (24.4) 6.4 (11.9) 3.84 ,0.00112 mo 24.2 (22.8) 8.7 (15.1) 2.78 ,0.00118 mo 23.4 (23.6) 9.1 (15.5) 2.57 ,0.001Change over time p-value ,0.001 0.41 \u2014 \u2014Per interval change 25.2 (23.50) 20.18 (15.13) \u2014 ,0.001Baseline to last available change 29.53 (23.07) 20.11 (17.62) \u2014 ,0.001At-work productivity lossBaseline 9.1 (4.6) 2.3 (3.3) 3.96 ,0.0016 mo 6.7 (4.6) 2.1 (2.8) 3.19 ,0.00112 mo 6.6 (4.7) 2.5 (3.4) 2.64 ,0.00118 mo 6.3 (4.9) 2.2 (3.0) 2.86 ,0.001Change over time p ,0.001 0.78 \u2014 \u2014Per interval change 21.13 (4.3) 20.07 (3.15) \u2014 ,0.001Baseline to last available change 22.01 (4.34) 0.0 (3.5) \u2014 ,0.001AbsencesBaseline 1.8 (2.3) 0.6 (1.3) 3.0 ,0.0016 mo 1.5 (2.1) 0.5 (1.3) 3.0 ,0.00112 mo 1.6 (2.3) 0.6 (1.6) 2.67 ,0.00118 mo 1.4 (2.1) 0.6 (1.3) 2.33 0.002Change over time p 0.37 0.82 \u2014 \u2014Per interval change 20.05 (2.76) 20.05 (1.78) \u2014 0.99Baseline to last available change 20.15 (2.92) 20.11 (1.77) \u2014 0.73Productivity loss owing to absencesBaseline 17.9 (23.2) 6.2 (12.8) 2.89 ,0.0016 mo 16.9 (34.5) 4.9 (13.6) 3.45 ,0.00112 mo 15.2 (21.0) 5.6 (13.1) 2.71 ,0.00118 mo 12.6 (19.1) 5.8 (14.2) 2.17 0.004Change over time p 0.33 0.86 \u2014 \u2014Per interval change 20.03 (29.84) 20.38 (16.57) \u2014 0.85Baseline to last available change 21.26 (32.27) 20.73 (16.89) \u2014 0.73/C192The baseline sample for the depression group was 286.

Bothgroups were predominantly white (p 5.14; Table 1). There were no differ-ences in weekly work hours (p 5.40),company size (p 5.99), and number ofjobs since age 18 (p 5.48). Thedepression group had a smaller per-centage of self-employed persons (p 5.02), fewer mean years on the job (p 5.002), and fewer workers in the pro-fessional/administrative/managerial/technical occupational group (p 5.04). The depression group had lessdemanding jobs according to theimputed demands score (p 5.02).The depression group had poorermean general mental and physicalhealth (p ,.001 for each comparison)and more comorbidities (p 5.01).There was an 11-point baseline groupdifference in mean depression symp-tom severity scores, with the depressiongroup significantly higher (p ,.001).Depression symptom severity differ-ences remained at each follow-up (p ,.001; Table 2). These differences oc-curred despite significant improve-ments within the depression group (p,.001 across time points).At baseline, the depression grouphad lower mean job control and highermean physical demands than controls(each at p#.001; Table 2), butpsychological demands were not signif-icantly different ( p5.13). The groupdifference in the mean scores at base-line was 11 points for job control, ninepoints for physical demands, and threepoints for psychological demands.At each follow-up, the depressiongroup had lower mean job control scores(p#.001 for each comparison), despitesignificantly improving over time ( p5.05). Physical demands scores remainedhigher in the depression group at eachfollow-up, although differences weresignificant only at the 12-month follow-up (p5.006). Neither physical norpsychological demands scores changedsignificantly over time within eithergroup ( p..05 for each comparison).Compared with controls, the de-pression group had significantly morebaseline work limitations and absences(p,.001 for each comparison;Table 2). Within the depression group,the average amount of time with worklimitations was 35.5% for time man-agement, 19.5% for physical tasks,36.2% for mental-interpersonal jobtasks, and 36.4% for output tasks. Thecontrol group means were 9.8%, 7.8%,9.5%, and 8.4%, respectively. Thus, thedepression group had more than twoto four times the amount of worklimitations, depending on which aspectof work was measured. Baseline meanat-work productivity loss was 9.1% inthe depression group and 2.3% forcontrols (p ,.001).In the 2 weeks before baseline, thedepression group averaged 1.8 absencedays, and the mean amount of pro-ductivity loss owing to absences was17.9%. In the control group, the meannumber of absences was 0.6, and themean amount of productivity loss owingto absence days was 6.2%. On average,the depression group had three times asmany absences and a similar ratio ofproductivity loss owing to absences ( p,.001 in both comparisons).In the depression group, work limi-tations affecting time management,mental-interpersonal tasks, and outputtasks declined significantly (p ,.001).Within the control group, there wereno significant changes in work limita-tion scale scores over time (p \u00a7.41 ormore on each scale). Work limitationscale scores were significantly worse inthe depression group at all follow-ups(p,.001). Absences were higher forthe depression group at all time points(p#.002) and did not changesignificantly in either group (p \u00a7.37).In both the cross-sectional and lon-gitudinal work limitation models, thework stressor variables (psychologicaldemands, job control, and physicaldemands) made small but significantcontributions to explaining several ofthese work outcomes. Cross-sectionally,the following results were observed(Table 3). Difficulty with time man-agement was greater with greater de-pression severity (p ,.001), poorergeneral physical health (p ,.001),greater psychological job demands (p,.001), interaction of depression andpsychological job demands (p 5.005),presence of depression at baseline (p 5.002), and lower job control (p 5.02).The model r2was .46 (p ,.0001).Difficulty performing mental and in-terpersonal tasks was related to havingmore severe depression (p ,.001),presence of depression at baseline (p 5.002), greater psychologic demands (p5.005), and lower job control (p 5.001). The model r2was .54 (p ,.0001). Difficulty managing outputtasks was related to greater depressionseverity (p ,.001), poorer generalphysical health (p 5.022), greaterpsychological demands (p ,.001),depression by psychological demandsinteraction (p ,.001), lower jobcontrol (p 5.006), and presence ofdepression at baseline (p 5.004). Themodel r2was .46 (p ,.0001). Difficultyperforming physical tasks was relatedto more severe depression (p ,.001),poorer general physical health (p ,.001), lower job control (p 5.001), andgreater physical demands (p 5.001).The model r2was .33 (p ,.0001).In the longitudinal models (Ta-ble 4), an improvement in work limi-tations was predicted by decreaseddepression symptom severity (p ,.001in three models and p5.04 in thephysical tasks model), and in twomodels, by change in general physicalhealth (p 5.02 in the time manage-ment model and p,.001 in thephysical tasks model). The work limi-tation model r2statistics ranged from.11 to .18; p,.0001 in all models.Change in limitations performingphysical tasks was predicted by change injob control ( p5.02; Table 4). Changesin psychological or physical demandsdid not contribute to the explanation ofchange in work limitations.In cross-sectional and longitudinalmodels (Tables 3 and 4, respectively),absences were predicted by depressionsymptom severity (p ,.01) and poorergeneral physical health (p #.001).Absences were unrelated to workstressors. The cross-sectional model r2was .19 (p ,.0001). The longitudinalmodel r2was .07 (p 5.004).DISCUSSIONThis study provided new informationabout the burden of depression onworking adults and provided furtherevidence regarding the harmful effectsof psychologically demanding, lowcontrol, and physically demandingwork. The results confirm that pres-enteeism and absenteeism are higherfor workers with depression symptomsthan healthy controls. Throughout the210 American Journal of Health PromotionFor individual use only. Duplication or distribution prohibited by law.study, presenteeism rates measured bythe WLQ were at least two to three timeshigher with depression. Absences showeda similar pattern. The study also partlyconfirmed that specific work stressorsadd to the burden of depression.With regard to the role of depression,we found that depressed workers hadfour times the amount of work limita-tions as controls and 2.5 times thenumber of absences; these gaps nar-rowed but never closed. Also, we found,as have others, that both the presence ofdepression and depression symptomseverity influence ability to work. In thisstudy, presence of depression at baselinehad an impact independent of depres-sion symptom severity. The meaning ofthis result is not completely clear, but itsuggests that depression\u2019s impact mayhave started before the present depres-sive episode. The study also put theimportance of depression symptom se-verity into perspective. Relative to therole of work stressors, we found that theimpact of depression symptom severity islarge. A one-point increase in depressionsymptom severity corresponds to a 1.6%increase in limitations in time manage-ment. In comparison, a one-point in-crease in psychological demands corre-sponds to a .134% increase on the sameWLQ scale.Results from cross-sectional modelsprovide evidence to support the study\u2019shypothesis. In addition to depression,each work stressor predicted one ormore outcomes. Psychologically de-manding work increased the amountof difficulty workers had managingtime and performing mental-interper-sonal and output tasks. The impact ofhaving a psychologically demandingjob on time management and per-forming output tasks was significantlyworse for workers with depression.Lower job control increased theamount of difficulty workers had man-aging time and performing mental-interpersonal, output, and physical jobtasks. A physically demanding job in-creased the amount of difficulty work-ers had performing physical job tasks.We also found evidence for theeffects of job control in the longitudinalmodels. A decline in the level of controlat work was associated with a decreasedability to perform physical job tasks.None of the other work stressors wereimportant in predicting work limita-tions or absences longitudinally. Weobserved that when workers remain inthe same occupation (which in mostcases meant the same job and compa-ny), job conditions remained relativelystable. Without much change in workstressors, they could not have had muchof an impact on changes in worklimitations or absences.In the work stressor literature, onlyone study has investigated the role ofwork stressors among workers with pre-existing mental health problems. Ourresults are not entirely consistent with itsfindings.

Our re-sults were similar for at-work limitationsbut not for self-reported work absences.The absence results in this study mayreflect the relatively low frequency ofmissed work time in the 2-week timewindow as well as the influence onabsence behavior of workplace policiesand practices. This study did not haveinformation about the latter and thuscould not address their impact.This study had several methodologicweaknesses and strengths. We attempt-ed to maximize the study\u2019s internal andexternal validity by removing variablesthat demonstrated bias. We removedtwo workplace social support variables(coworker and supervisor support) andfour psychological demands scale items(excessive work, enough time, conflict-ing demands, and hectic job). However,by eliminating these variables, we mayhave underestimated the influence ofpsychological demands and social sup-port in our models, and thus wereduced the comparability of thisstudy\u2019s results to others\u2019. In contrast,study advances included its longitudinaldesign, the comparison healthy controlgroup, eligibility based on employmentstatus, large-scale recruitment to helpobtain representation of occupationsand industries, extensive measurementof employment characteristics, atten-tion to self-report accuracy, and validand responsive outcomes measures.26\u201329Results suggest that symptom reliefand other vocational interventions maybenefit employees with depression andtheir employers. Vocational interven-tions conceivably could occur at thelevel of the worker and/or workplaceand in various delivery settings. Workstress reduction trials have had moresuccess with individually focused cogni-tive behavioral therapies than organi-zation-level changes, but the field isrelatively new.35,36Studies within voca-tional rehabilitation and disability pre-vention suggest the importance ofoptimizing the fit of the person and theenvironment.37Delivery settings such asworksite occupational health clinicsand/or employee assistance programsmay hold promise for improving out-reach and augmenting the care provid-ed in medical settings. New care modelswill be needed to help the manyworking people with mental healthproblems sustain their ability to work.Table 4Relationships of Work Limitations and Absences to Depression and Work Stressors: Longitudinal Multiple RegressionAnalyses (Beta Coefficients, Standard Errors, and p*)WLQ and WLQ Absence Module Scale ScoresTimeManagementPhysicalTasksMental-InterpersonalTasksOutputTasks AbsencesN 582 597 596 596 613R20.11 0.11 0.18 0.16 0.07Model p ,0.0001 ,0.0001 ,0.0001 ,0.0001 0.0038Depression present (1,0) 20.56 (1.07)(p50.600)20.36 (1.14)(p50.752)21.20 (0.84)(p50.152)22.39 (1.15)(p=0.038)20.04 (0.12)(p50.776)Depression symptom severity change 1.09 (0.25)(p,0.0001)0.48 (0.23)(p=0.039)1.29 (0.18)(p,0.0001)1.37 (0.27)(p,0.0001)0.06 (0.02)(p=0.009)General physical health 20.31 (0.14)(p=0.024)20.49 (0.11)(p,0.0001)20.12 (0.11)(p50.258)20.20 (0.12)(p50.102)20.05 (0.02)(p=0.001)Imputed demands 20.22 (0.52)(p50.670)0.37 (0.63)(p50.550)20.35 (0.48)(p50.471)21.19 (0.69)(p50.084)20.05 (0.07)(p50.439)Psychological demands change (0\u2013100) /C19220.66 (0.55)(p50.224)20.22 (0.47)(p50.643)20.47 (0.36)(p50.192)0.32 (0.44)(p50.475)20.03 (0.06)(p50.613)Job control change (0\u2013100) /C192 0.01 (0.43)(p50.980)21.12 (0.48)(p=0.018)20.34 (0.38)(p50.367)20.94 (0.52)(p50.068)0.01 (0.06)(p50.806)Physical demands change (0\u2013100) /C192 1.06 (0.61)(p50.083)20.19 (0.61)(p50.760)0.69 (0.45)(p50.124)0.21 (0.50)(p50.680)0.08 (0.07)(p50.262)WLQ indicates Work Limitations Questionnaire.Note: Bold font denotes statistical significance.

Implications for HealthPromotion Practitionersand ResearchersThis study indicates that theadverse work outcomes of depres-sion are related to both the severityof symptoms and work conditions.Combined with prior research, re-sults suggest that employees withdepression have an unmet need forhigh-quality depression treatment.However, this study also suggeststhat there is an unmet need toaddress work conditions that alsocontribute to depression-relatedwork limitations.If assertions about the need toaddress symptoms and work condi-tions hold true, then the study hasimplications for both health pro-motion professionals and programs.Generally, the medical care settingswhere adults receive depressiontreatment do not have the expertiseor resources available to provide212 American Journal of Health PromotionFor individual use only.
