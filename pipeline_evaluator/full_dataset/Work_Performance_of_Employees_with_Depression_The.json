Adler, MD; William H. Rogers, PhD; Hong Chang, PhD;\n\nLeueen Lapitsky, MPH; Thomas McLaughlin, ScD; John Reed, MD\n\nAbstract\n\nPurpose. Depressed employees are vulnerable to adverse work outcomes. We hypothesized that work\nperformance is impaired by depression and is worsened by exposure to psychosocial work stressors.\n\nDesign. Longitudinal cohort study with surveys administered at baseline, 6, 12, and 18\nmonths.\n\nSetting. Recruitment in primary care offices.\n\nSubjects. A total of 14,268 were screened; 286 depressed, employed adults (18-62 years)\nand 193 controls were enrolled.\n\nMeasures. At-work limitations (presenteeism) and absenteeism were measured with the Work\nLimitations Questionnaire (WLQ) and WLQ Work Absence Module, respectively. Work\nstressors were assessed using a modified version of the Job Content Questionnaire.\n\nAnalysis. Univariate and multivariate tests assessed the degree to which at-work limitations\nwere related to depression and/or stressful work.\n\nResults. Presentecism and absenteeism were significantly worse for the depression group at\neach time point (p =< .001). In cross-sectional models, presentecism was associated with more\nsevere depression symptoms, poorer general physical health, psychologically demanding work, the\ninteraction of psychologically demanding work with depression, and less job control (r* range =\n33-54). Absences were explained by depression symptom severity and poorer general physical\n‘health but not work stressors (r* = .19). Because of minimal change in the work stressors, their\nlongitudinal effects on outcomes were mostly nonsignificant.\n\nConclusion. This study found that depression symptoms are related to work absences and\nimpaired work performance, and results partly confirmed that work stressors add to this impact.\nResults suggest that workers with depression may benefit from care involving medical and\nvocational interventions.

Work that is\nlow in control involves constrained\ndecision latitude and skill discretion.\nThe job strain model suggests that\nthere is an interaction between de-\nmands and control, defining the so-\ncalled “*high-strain” jobs (high de-\nmands/low control) as most harmful\nand the “active” jobs (high demand/\nhigh control) as most healthful. Al-\nthough there is a great deal of vari-\nability within occupations, examples of\n\nJanuary/February 2010, Vol. 24, No. 3 205\n\n\nidual use only.\n\nhigh-strain jobs are waitresses and\nwaiters, nurse’s aides, and some as-\nsemblers. With some exceptions, ob-\nservational and intervention research\nconfirms that job control is important\nto health, but results are mixed for\npsychological demands.'>'® Studies\nbased on competing models, such as\nthe Effort-Reward-Imbalance model,\nwhich addresses a dimension of fair-\nness, have shown similar results.!?\n\nThis is the first study to investigate\nwhether work stressors influence the\noutcome of workers who have\ndepression. We speculated that a\ndemanding workload, lack of control,\nand/or unsupportive environment\nmay contribute to functional and\nproductivity losses for the following\nreasons: (1) it may be difficult for\ndepressed workers to make adjust\nments that could help them cope with\ndepression symptoms and impair-\nments (e.g., varying the pace of work\nin relation to energy levels, going to\nmedical appointments, and/or\nmodifying job tasks) and/or (2) the\nresultant work stress may prolong\nsymptoms and impairments. Recent\nresearch documents that work stress\nis associated with depression.* We\nhypothesized that, compared with\nnondepressed workers, those with\ndepression have more impaired work\nperformance and this impairment is\nfurther worsened by exposure to\npsychosocial work stressors (e.g.\nhigh psychological demands, limited\ncontrol, and/or insufficient social\nsupport).\n\nMETHODS\n\nDesign\n\nA longitudinal cohort study was\nconducted in which the work outcomes\nof two groups of employed adults were\ncompared: a group with major depres-\nsion (MDD), dysthymia, or both\n(known as “double depression”\n[DD]),?%* and a group of healthy\ncontrols. A third group with rheuma-\ntoid arthritis was enrolled but is not\nincluded in this analysis.\n\nSample\nThe study samples were recruited\nbetween February 2001 and March\n2003. The institutional review boards\nof all participating sites approved study\nprotocols. After explanation of the\n\n206 American Journal of Health Promotion\n\nDuplication or distribution prohibited by law.\n\nstudy to eligible individuals, written\ninformed consent was obtained. The\nstudy included the following eligibility\ncriteria: between 18 and 62 years of\nage, working at least 15 hours per\nweek, English speaking and/or read-\ning, not planning to retire within 2\nyears, no current or pending disability\nand/or Worker’s Compensation claim,\nno current alcoholism or drug abuse,\nno pregnancy or childbirth in the past\n6 months, and none of 13 disabling\nmedical conditions (e.g., angina, con-\ngestive heart failure, stroke, diabetes,\nchronic obstructive lung disease, and\nbipolar disorder). In addition, individ-\nuals qualifying for the depression\ngroup had to screen-in for MDD and/\nor dysthymia. To be eligible for the\ncontrol group, the person had to\nhave no more than one depression\nsymptom.\n\nEligibility assessment involved the\nfollowing steps: (1) research assistants\n(RAs) in primary care physician (PCP)\noffices invited patients, except those in\nobvious discomfort, to complete a brief\nself-report screening survey; (2) the\nPCP was informed of the result and\nasked to confirm medical eligibility;\n(3) confirmed depressed patients and\na 10% random sample of potentially\neligible control patients were mailed a\nbaseline questionnaire, consent form,\nand opt-out card; (4) if no opt-out card\nwas returned, the RA called to explain\nthe study and ask additional eligibility\nquestions (e.g., recent bereavement\nand the Patient Health Questionnaire\n(PHQ-9) depression items®>%). If a\npatient refused the interview or was\nunreachable, a message was left invit-\ning him or her to complete the hard-\ncopy forms and send them back; and\n(5) eligible patients returning their\nbaseline and consent forms were en-\nrolled. Each was asked to answer and\nreturn a postage-paid mail survey every\n6 months for 18 months. To encourage\nresponse, telephone and postcard re-\nminders, survey remailings, and mon-\netary incentives ($20 for the baseline\nand $10 for each follow-up) were used.\n\nThe PCP office screening survey was\ncompleted by 14,268 patients: 4124\n(29%) were ineligible, 8235 (58%)\nwere healthy controls not needed for\nthe study, and 1909 (13%) were po-\ntentially eligible. Of the 1909, 437\n(23%) were ineligible based on physi-\n\ncian feedback (e.g., the patient had a\ndisabling medical condition not previ-\nously reported that excluded him/her\nfrom participating), 646 (34%) did not\ncomplete the screening procedure,\nand 826 (43%) were fully screened and\neligible, including 716 for the depres-\nsion and healthy control groups (the\nrest had rheumatoid arthritis and are\nnot included in this analysis). Of the\n716, a group of 237 (33%) declined\nparticipation and 479 (67%) enrolled.\nThe enrolled sample consisted of a\ndepression group composed of 286\nadults with confirmed dysthymia\n(based on criteria from the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual Edition IV®\") (n\n= 72), MDD (n = 105), or DD (n =\n109), and a comparison group of\nhealthy controls (n = 193).\n\nBased on screening results, study\nparticipants were similar to those de-\nclining participation on mean age,\nmean general mental and general\nphysical health (based on SF-12 mental\nand physical component summary\nscores,” respectively), and percent\nwith depression. A larger percentage of\nstudy participants were male (p <\nL001).\n\nAmong participants, attrition was\ngreater in the depression group com-\npared with controls (12.5% vs. 6.6%;\np= .04). Within the depression group,\nthose who completed the study were\nsimilar to the dropouts on depression\nsymptom severity (measured with the\nPHQ-9), mean age, gender, and mean\ngeneral mental and general physical\nhealth.\n\nMeasures\n\nStudy outcomes were measured by\nthe Work Limitations Questionnaire\n(WLQ). The WLQ has been validated\nfor employed samples with and without\ndepression. ?™ The WLQ’s four work\nlimitation scale scores and productivity\nloss score are presenteeism indicators.\nEach scale score indicates the percent\nage of time in the prior 2 weeks that\nhealth problems limited the person’s\nability to perform four types of work\ntasks: time management (five items),\nphysical tasks (six items), mental-in-\nterpersonal tasks (nine items), and\noutput tasks (e.g., handling the work-\nload and finishing work on time; five\nitems). Scores range from 0 (none of\nthe time) to 100 (all of the time). The\n\n\nFor individual use only.\nDuplication or di\n\nsummary at-work productivity loss\nscore is the weighted sum of the four\nscale scores.”\n\nThe WLQ’s Work Absence Module\n(two items) measures the number of\nhealth-related workdays missed in the\npast 2 weeks (absences). Scores range\nfrom 0 to 11 or more workdays.\nProductivity loss owing to absences\nreflects the number of absences divid-\ned by the number of days usually\nworked in a 2-week period.\n\nThe validated Job Content Ques-\ntionnaire (JCQ),” modified slightly for\na national survey, was used to measure\npsychological demands (seven items),\njob control (five items)” and\ndemands (five items), collectively re-\nferred to as “‘work stressors.” Scores\nrange from 0 (low demands or control)\nto 100 (high demands or control).\n\nObjective measures of occupational\ndemands were imputed from O*NET,*\na national database (labeled the “‘im-\nputed demands” variable). O*NET\nvariables describe occupational charac-\nteristics according to their level of\nintensity and/or importance. Based on\nour prior depression research showing\nthat they were related to WLQ scores,”\nwe elected to include 16 O*NET vari-\nables describing demands for social\ninteraction, concentration, judgment,\nand physical stamina.\n\nTo create an imputed demands\nvariable for each participant from\nO*NET data, the following process was\nused. With each survey administration,\nemployed participants completed\nstandard open-ended questions about\ntheir occupation. A study RA read each\nanswer and assigned to it a Bureau of\nthe Census occupational code.* Using\nthe occupational code to link the study\nand O*NET databases, 16 variable\nscores were assigned to each partici-\npant. To facilitate analysis, we created\nan O*NET summary score (the sum of\nthe weighted raw scores for each of the\n16 O*NET variables with weights sup-\nplied by factor loadings from a princi-\npal components factor analysis). The\nsummary imputed demands score was\nstandardized to a mean = 0 and\nstandard deviation = 1, with a higher\nscore reflecting greater demand for\nhigher-order cognitive and communi-\ncation skills (e.g, learning, problem\nsolving, judgment, decision making)\nvs. physical skills.\n\nibution prohibited by law.\n\nTable 1\nBaseline Demographics and Health Characteristics\nDepression Control\nGroup Group\nn=286 193 P\nMean age, y (SD) 38.9 (112) 41.1 (10.7) 0.03\nMale, No. (%) 48 (16) 51 (26) 0.01\nMarried, No. (%) 119 (42) 121 (64) <0.001\nWhite, No. (%) 255 (89) 178 (93) 0.14\nMean years of education (SD) 14.2 (2.1) 15.2 (1.8) <0.001\nMedian annual earnings, dollars (IQR) 33,800 (21,840) 43,000 (35,256) <0.001\nMean weekly work hours (SD) 38.1 (12.8) 39.1 (13.3) 0.40\nSelf-employed, No. (%) 19 (7) 25 (13) 0.02\nMean years on the job (SD) 22(1.1) 25(12) 0.002\nCompany size, No. of employees (%)\n<25 65 (23) 45 (24) 0.99\n25-99 53 (19) 30 (16)\n100-999 76 (27) 52 (28)\n=1000 86 (31) 60 (32)\nOccupational group, No. (%)\nProfessional, administrative, managerial, technical ~~ 137 (48) 110 (57) 0.04\nSales, service, support 127 (44) 72 (37)\nRepairs, construction, production, transportation 22 (8) 10 (5)\nMean No. of jobs since age 18 (SD) 1.2 (0.5) 1.2 (0.5) 0.48\nMean imputed demands (SD) ~0.1 (1.0) 0.1 (1.0) 0.02\nMean depression symptom severity (SD) 13.2 (5.5) 258 (2.9) <0.001\nCurrently taking antidepressant, No. (%) 127 (45) 19 (10) <0.001\nMean general mental health score (SD) 33.4 (10.1) 52.1 (7.5) <0.001\nMean general physical health score (SD) 48.0 (9.3) 51.2 (6.3) <0.001\nMean No. of comorbidities (SD) 0.2 (0.4) 0.1 (0.3) 0.01\n\nIQR indicates interquartile range.\n\nHealth variables included condition\ngroup (depression group = 1, control\ngroup = 0), presence of depression\n(yes = 1, no = 0), based on a PHQ-9\ndepression symptom count (0—4 symp-\ntoms = not depressed, 5-9 symptoms\n= depressed), depression symptom\nseverity (also measured by the PHQ-9)\nranging from a score of 0 (no symp-\ntoms) to 27 (severe symptoms), cur-\nrently taking antidepressant medica-\ntion (yes = 1, no = 0), general mental\nhealth (based on the SF-12 Mental\nComponent Summary [MCS-12] score)\nand general physical health (based on\nthe SF-12 Physical Component Sum-\nmary [PCS-12] score) (each scored as\n10 for worst health to 70 for best\nhealth) > and number of comorbid\nchronic medical conditions (comor-\nbidities) (0-8 conditions).\n\nDemographics included continuous\nage, gender (female = 1, male = 0),\nmarital status (married = 1, not\nmarried = 0), race/ethnicity (white =\n\n1; nonwhite = 0), years of education\n(0-17), annual earnings, weekly work\nhours (observed range, 0-84), self-\nemployment status (self-employed = 1;\nnot self-employed = 0), years on the job\n(<1, 24, 5-9, and >10), company size\n(<25 employees, 25-99, 100-999, and\n>1000), three dummy variables for\noccupational group (professional, ad-\nministrative, managerial, and technical;\nsales, service, and support; and repairs,\nconstruction, production, and trans-\nportation), and number of jobs held\nsince age 18 (observed range, 1-11).\n\nAnalysis\nInitially we generated descriptive\nstatistics. Results are presented as\nmeans and their standard deviations\nand percentages. Condition group\ndifferences were tested using x?, ttests,\nor analysis of variance and were repre-\nsented by p values. Results are also\nexpressed as risk ratios. Each risk ratio\nis the result of dividing the mean score\n\nJanuary/February 2010, Vol. 24, No. 3 207\n\n\nFor individual use only.\n\nDuplication or distribution prohibited by law.\n\nfor the depression group by the mean\n\nscore for the control group. For\nexample, the risk ratio of 3.6 for the\n\nWLQ time management scale at base-\nline means that the depression group\n\nin general experienced about a 3.6\ntimes higher score than the control\ngroup.\n\nNext we investigated the impact of\ndepression and work stressors on the\n\noutcomes (four work limitations scale\nscores and absences) using both cross-\n\nsectional and longitudinal multiple\n\nlinear regression models. Stata version\n\n7.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station,\nTexas) was used.*\n\nModels include only those partici\npants who were currently employed\nand had WLQ data. To reduce con-\nfounding owing to changing occupa-\n\ntions, only the participants who stayed\n\nin their baseline occupation were\n\nincluded. If a participant had stopped\n\nworking or changed occupations, his\nor her data were excluded from that\npoint forward.\n\nThe cross-sectional analyses address\nthe relationship between the outcomes\n\nof interindividual differences in work\nstressors. The longitudinal analyses\naddress the relationship between the\ndifferences in intraindividual-level\n\nchanges in work stressors on change in\noutcome. Because occupation does not\nchange, the longitudinal analyses rule\n\nout the possibility that change in the\nwork outcomes is related to a change\nin employment.\n\nWith 479 participants, the maximum\nnumber of cross-sectional observations\nwas 1916. Of these, we lost 277 (14%)\n\nto attrition, 330 (17%) to unemploy-\nment or a new occupation, and 194\n(10%) to missing data on major\n\nindependent variables.

This short version did\nnot include the JCQ variables.\n\nEach multiple linear regression\nmodel addresses one of the five out\ncomes (scores for the time manage-\nment, physical, mental-interpersonal,\nand output scales, and absences). The\ndependent variables for the cross-sec-\ntional models consist of the score at a\nspecific time point. For the longitudi-\n\nnal models, the outcomes reflect the\ndifference between a follow-up score\nand the next prior score. Each partic-\nipant could have a maximum of four\ntime points and three intervals.\nModels estimate the association be-\ntween an outcome and condition\ngroup (depression vs. control), de-\npression symptom severity, general\nphysical health, work stressors, imput-\ned demands score, and interaction\n\nterms for condition group by work\nstressor.\n\nThe main effects for psychologic\ndemands, job control, and physical\ndemands were centered to improve the\naccuracy of the estimates for them.\nModels control for age, gender, and\nnumber of years on the job. Prelimi-\nnary regression analyses indicated that\nvariables such as marital status, years of\neducation, and annual earnings did\nnot contribute significantly to the\nmodels. A study site variable is not\nincluded because preliminary analyses\nindicated that it was not significant. To\naddress the possibility of selecting\nparticipants with pre-existing work\ndifficulties, models control for the\nbaseline value of the dependent vari-\nable. Regression results are reported as\nbetas, confidence intervals, and p\nvalues. Clustering is used for the\nlongitudinal models to account for the\ncorrelation in successive observations.\n\nPreliminary tests were conducted to\nevaluate whether the work stressor\nresponses were biased by depression.\nIn a series of linear regression models,\nscores for psychological demands, job\ncontrol, supervisor and coworker sup-\nport (from the JCQ), and physical\ndemands were regressed on a condi-\ntion group indicator and depression\nsymptom severity score, general physi-\ncal health score (PCS-12), and imputed\ndemands score, adjusting for age,\ngender, and years on the job. Cross-\nsectional and longitudinal models were\ntested. If a depression variable was\nsignificantly related to a self-report\nwork scale, then the scale’s items were\nanalyzed. Items significantly related to\ndepression were removed from further\nanalysis, and only the remaining scale\nvariables were rescored (Technical\nAppendix available from authors).\n\nThe social support variables (super-\nvisor and coworker support) were\nsignificantly related to depression as\nwere four psychological demands scale\nitems (excessive work, enough time,\nconflicting demands, and hectic job).\nThese items were excluded from all\nfurther analyses.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCompared with controls (Table 1),\nthe depression group was younger (p =\n03), had a higher percentage of\n\nJanuary/February 2010, Vol. 24, No. 3 209\n\n\nidual use only.\n\nwomen (p = .01), unmarried individ-\nuals (p < .001), lower mean years of\neducation (p < .001), and lower mean\nannual earnings (p < .001).

Absences showed\na similar pattern. The study also partly\nconfirmed that specific work stressors\nadd to the burden of depression.\n\nWith regard to the role of depression,\nwe found that depressed workers had\nfour times the amount of work limita-\ntions as controls and 2.5 times the\nnumber of absences; these gaps nar-\nrowed but never closed. Also, we found,\nas have others, that both the presence of\ndepression and depression symptom\nseverity influence ability to work. In this\nstudy, presence of depression at baseline\nhad an impact independent of depres-\nsion symptom severity. The meaning of\nthis result is not completely clear, but it\nsuggests that depression’s impact may\nhave started before the present depres-\nsive episode. The study also put the\nimportance of depression symptom se-\nverity into perspective. Relative to the\nrole of work stressors, we found that the\n\nimpact of depression symptom severity is\nlarge. A one-point increase in depression\nsymptom severity corresponds to a 1.6%\nincrease in limitations in time manage-\nment. In comparison, a one-point in-\ncrease in psychological demands corre-\nsponds to a .134% increase on the same\nWLQ scale.\n\nResults from cross-sectional models\nprovide evidence to support the study’s\nhypothesis. In addition to depression,\neach work stressor predicted one or\nmore outcomes. Psychologically de-\nmanding work increased the amount\nof difficulty workers had managing\ntime and performing mental-interper-\nsonal and output tasks. The impact of\nhaving a psychologically demanding\njob on time management and per-\nforming output tasks was significantly\nworse for workers with depression.\nLower job control increased the\namount of difficulty workers had man-\naging time and performing mental-\ninterpersonal, output, and physical job\n\ntasks. A physically demanding job in-\ncreased the amount of difficulty work-\ners had performing physical job tasks.\n\nWe also found evidence for the\neffects of job control in the longitudinal\nmodels. A decline in the level of control\nat work was associated with a decreased\nability to perform physical job tasks.\nNone of the other work stressors were\nimportant in predicting work limita-\ntions or absences longitudinally. We\nobserved that when workers remain in\nthe same occupation (which in most\ncases meant the same job and compa-\nny), job conditions remained relatively\nstable. Without much change in work\nstressors, they could not have had much\nof an impact on changes in work\nlimitations or absences.\n\nIn the work stressor literature, only\none study has investigated the role of\nwork stressors among workers with pre-\nexisting mental health problems.

Our re-\nsults were similar for atwork limitations\nbut not for self-reported work absences.\nThe absence results in this study may\nreflect the relatively low frequency of\nmissed work time in the 2-week time\nwindow as well as the influence on\nabsence behavior of workplace policies\nand practices. This study did not have\ninformation about the latter and thus\ncould not address their impact.\n\nThis study had several methodologic\nweaknesses and strengths. We attempt-\ned to maximize the study's internal and\nexternal validity by removing variables\nthat demonstrated bias. We removed\ntwo workplace social support variables\n(coworker and supervisor support) and\nfour psychological demands scale items\n(excessive work, enough time, conflict\ning demands, and hectic job). However,\nby eliminating these variables, we may\nhave underestimated the influence of\npsychological demands and social sup-\nport in our models, and thus we\nreduced the comparability of this\nstudy’s results to others’. In contrast,\n\n212 American Journal of Health Promotion\n\nstudy advances included its longitudinal\ndesign, the comparison healthy control\ngroup, eligibility based on employment\nstatus, large-scale recruitment to help\nobtain representation of occupations\nand industries, extensive measurement\nof employment characteristics, atten-\ntion to self-report accuracy, and valid\nand responsive outcomes measures. ?\nResults suggest that symptom relief\nand other vocational interventions may\nbenefit employees with depression and\ntheir employers. Vocational interven-\ntions conceivably could occur at the\nlevel of the worker and/or workplace\nand in various delivery settings. Work\nstress reduction trials have had more\nsuccess with individually focused cogni-\ntive behavioral therapies than organi-\nzation-level changes, but the field is\nrelatively new.**® Studies within voca-\ntional rehabilitation and disability pre-\nvention suggest the importance of\noptimizing the fit of the person and the\nenvironment.” Delivery settings such as\nworksite occupational health clinics\nand/or employee assistance programs\nmay hold promise for improving out-\nreach and augmenting the care provid-\ned in medical settings. New care models\n\nwill be needed to help the many\nworking people with mental health\nproblems sustain their ability to work.\n\nSO WHAT? Implications for Health\nPromotion Practitioners\nand Researchers\n\nThis study indicates that the\nadverse work outcomes of depres-\nsion are related to both the severity\nof symptoms and work conditions.\nCombined with prior research, re-\nsults suggest that employees with\ndepression have an unmet need for\nhigh-quality depression treatment.\nHowever, this study also suggests\nthat there is an unmet need to\naddress work conditions that also\ncontribute to depression-related\nwork limitations.\n\nIf assertions about the need to\naddress symptoms and work condi-\ntions hold true, then the study has\nimplications for both health pro-\nmotion professionals and programs.\nGenerally, the medical care settings\nwhere adults receive depression\ntreatment do not have the expertise\nor resources available to provide\n\n\n\nFor individual use only.\nDuplication or distribution prohibited by law.\n\nservices that address work issues.\nAdditional services might include\nvocational counseling, job redesign,\nand/or stress management; strate-\ngies that could conceivably help\nworkers maintain their productivity\nwhile recovering from depression.\nIn addition to considering the\nintegration of health promotion\nservices into medical care settings,\nalternative systems of care such as\nworksite occupational health clinics\nand/or employee assistance pro-\ngrams may hold promise for educat-\ning employees and employers about\ndepression’s impact in the workplace\nand providing support for workers.\nAlthough services can build upon\nexisting knowledge of mental health\nimprovement strategies, new research is\nneeded to design and test assessment\nand intervention approaches. There\nare gaps in both services research,\naddressing employee-level interven-\ntions, and in organizational research,\ntesting innovations aimed at modifying\nwork conditions, policies, and practices.\nBoth avenues have the potential to help\nworking people with mental health\nproblems sustain their ability to work.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
