They also havefrequently comorbid depression that can be considered a possible explanation for their cognitive dys-function. We evaluated the cognitive performance of patients with CFS in comparison with a controlgroup of healthy volunteers and a group of patients with MDD.Patients and methods: Twenty-\ufb01ve patients with CFS, 25 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD),and 25 healthy control subjects were given standardized tests of attention, working memory, and ver-bal and visual episodic memory, and were also tested for effects related to lack of effort/simulation,suggestibility, and fatigue.Results: Patients with CFS had slower phasic alertness, and also had impaired working, visual and verbalepisodic memory compared to controls. They were, however, no more sensitive than the other groups tosuggestibility or to fatigue induced during the cognitive session. Cognitive impairments in MDD patientswere strongly associated with depression and subjective fatigue; in patients with CFS, there was a weakercorrelation between cognition and depression (and no correlation with fatigue).Conclusions: This study con\ufb01rms the presence of an objective impairment in attention and memory inpatients with CFS but with good mobilization of effort and without exaggerated suggestibility.\u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition that ischaracterized by chronic fatigue, impairment of short-term mem-ory and musculoskeletal pain [1]. CFS is marked by persistent orrelapsing debilitating fatigue that: (1) does not resolve with bedrest; (2) is severe enough to reduce daily activity; and (3) has nosomatic explanation [2]. A number of symptoms may be present,including myalgia, headache, sore throat, and pains in the joints.Cognitive complaints are also frequently reported, particularly inrelation to memory and concentration [3\u20137] . However, althoughpatients with CFS often complain of cognitive dif\ufb01culties, neu-ropsychological studies that have attempted to objectively measurecognitive de\ufb01cits in such patients have yielded con\ufb02icting results./H22845Data presented at the APA meeting in Washington, May 6, 2008, poster NR5-047.\u2217Corresponding author at: Service de psychiatrie, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Avenue Hippocrate 10, 1200 Bruxelles, Belgium.

Constant).Subjective ratings of cognitive competence are poor predictors oflaboratory results [7], because they can be based on factors otherthan competence, such as emotional distress, fatigue, or malaise.In objective cognitive tests, authors have found that patients withCFS usually perform in the normal range for general intellec-tual abilities (WAIS: [3,8] ; and NART: [8]) and higher cognitivefunctions (planning, verbal \ufb02uency, abstract reasoning, problemsolving; see: [3\u20135,9\u201312] ). Data are less consistent for attentionand memory: some authors have reported impairment in ver-bal memory [5,10,13] , visual memory [5], concentration [6,11,13] ,attention span [6], reaction times [14\u201316] , and speed of infor-mation processing [4,10] , while others found no abnormalities inverbal memory [3,12,13,15] , visual memory [3,5,11,17] , concentra-tion [7,10] , attention span [5,6,10,11] , or reaction times [5]. Thesecon\ufb02icting results raise questions about the methodology of thesestudies and the objectivity of the tests used to assess the cognitiveimpairments. There is, indeed, a marked discrepancy between sub-jective complaints and objective performance that casts doubt onthe validity of the cognitive symptoms. In one study [10] , despiteno memory de\ufb01cits on neuropsychological tests, patients withCFS had more subjective complaints of cognitive impairment on0303-8467/$ \u2013 see front matter \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Such an explanation would suf\ufb01ce if a correlationbetween symptoms of depression and anxiety and certain neu-ropsychological measures had been observed (as for example instudies [6,7,11,17,21] ). However, this is not the case in all studies[3\u20135,13,15,22\u201325] . In addition, the possible direct effect of fatigueon cognitive performance in CFS has also been examined. Althoughmost authors [5,6,25\u201327] found no relationship between the levelof fatigue and performance on memory and attention tests, one wasnoted by Joyce et al. [13] . Thus, the direct effect of fatigue on cogni-tive performance in CFS remains unclear. In another condition, thepost-polio syndrome, Ostlund et al. [28] also did not \ufb01nd a relation-ship between general fatigue and cognitive de\ufb01cits. Finally, thereare multiple methodological dif\ufb01culties in the neuropsychologicalliterature on CFS, for example, heterogeneity in the diagnosis of CFSacross studies, presence of comorbid depression, and lack of controlgroups.It is, therefore, dif\ufb01cult to clarify whether there are objectivecognitive de\ufb01cits in patients with CFS, particularly in terms of mem-ory and executive functions, or whether the cognitive impairmentsare directly associated with the depressive symptoms in this con-dition. Hence, we evaluated as a primary objective, the cognitiveperformance of patients with CFS using standardized verbal andvisual memory tests, as well as sustained attention, phasic alert-ness, and the fatigue effect, compared with a control group ofhealthy volunteers. We investigated the same variables in a groupof patients with MDD. Particular attention was paid to the evalua-tion of the quantitative dimension of depressive symptoms in thepatients with CFS. Investigation of attention and memory functionswas chosen because these are the functions most often reportedas impaired in CFS but also in MDD. Our primary hypothesis wasthat patients with CFS would have cognitive impairments that wereonly partially correlated with the depressive dimension of the con-dition, suggesting that some cognitive impairments may be presentindependent of the depressive dimension. The partial relationshipbetween cognitive and depressive symptomatology could be con-\ufb01rmed by direct comparison with the MDD group.In addition to these primary objectives, we wanted to inves-tigate the possible gap between the subjective and objectivedimensions of cognition, as some studies have reported moresubjective complaints than objective impairments. Our secondaryobjectives were, therefore, to examine the subjects\u2019 reactions tosuggestibility. Some authors [29] have argued that subjects withCFS are more suggestible than healthy persons using a measure ofgeneral suggestibility and the hypnotic induction pro\ufb01le (HIP) [30] .Another way to approach this question would be to investigate taskinvolvement in order to exclude de\ufb01cit feigning and the attributionof cognitive de\ufb01cits to the possibility that CFS patients may be lessthan optimally motivated in the tasks (thus expending less effortbecause of a metacognitive belief of cognitive impairment).2. Materials and methods2.1. SubjectsWe studied 25 patients with CFS, 25 patients with MDD,and 25 healthy control subjects (see Table 1 for demographicparameters of these three groups). All of the participants wereright-handed. There was no signi\ufb01cant among-group differencefor age [ F(2,72) = .64; p= .52]. There was a signi\ufb01cant differencein degree of education among the three groups [ F(2,72] = 10.41;p< .01], with the MDD group having fewer years of education thanthe CFS and control groups (both p< .01). The groups were compa-rable for gender [ /US2(2, 75) = 3.86, p> .10].All the CFS patients met the diagnostic criterion for CFS, i.e., atleast six months of unexplained disabling fatigue [1,2] . CFS subjectswere recruited from the Referral Centre for CFS and MDD patientsfrom the outpatient psychiatric unit of the Cliniques UniversitairesSaint-Luc, Brussels. The healthy controls were recruited from thecare staff and volunteers of the Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Lucand from volunteer associations. Before entering the study, patientsand controls gave their informed consent to a protocol approved bythe Medical Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of the Uni-versit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain. The patients and the control subjectsunderwent a psychiatric interview supplemented by the StructuralClinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) [31] to con\ufb01rmthe diagnosis of unipolar major depressive episodes in the patientswith MDD and the absence of any Axis I psychiatric disorder inthe controls and the patients with CFS (in particular the absence ofMDD). Exclusion criteria for the control subjects were unexplainedfatigue, an organic condition that causes fatigue, an unstable med-ical condition, an organic brain disorder, the use of psychotropicdrugs, and a current or past mental disorder on the basis of theSCID I interview.2.2. Procedure2.2.1. Self-questionnairesSeveral scales were used to assess anxiety, depression, andfatigue. The 40-item State Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale (STAI A&B ) [32] assesses anxiety symptoms. The \ufb01rst sub-scale indicatesthe state of anxiety at the moment of the session (STAI-A); thesecond sub-scale indicates the subject\u2019s anxiety traits (STAI-B).The results are converted into T-scores. A French version of the21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [33] assesses depressionin adults [34] . The scores range from 0 to 63. A score of 13 orless indicates a non-depressed state; a score from 14 to 19 corre-sponds to \u201cmildly depressed\u201d; and a score over 20 indicates clinicaldepression. The geriatric depression scale (GDS) [35] is a 30-iteminstrument for assessing depression. The value of this questionnaireis that physical symptoms are excluded, whereas other instrumentsof depression assessment are too rich in somatic symptoms andtoo poor in cognitive symptoms. Scores range from 0 to 30. A scoreof 10 or less is considered to indicate the absence of depressivesymptoms, and a score over 11 re\ufb02ects the presence of depressivesymptoms. The fatigue severity scale (FSS) [36] is a 9-item scaleassessing \u201cdisabling fatigue\u201d. Total scores range from 9 to 63. Thehigher the score, the more the fatigue is disabling.E.L. Constant et al. / Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 (2011) 295\u2013302 2972.2.2. Cognitive tasksAttention was assessed with one computerized reaction timetest: the Phasic Alertness Task of the TEA1.5 battery [37] . In thistask, the subject is instructed to press a button as quickly as possibleas soon as a cross appears in the centre of the screen. In one con-dition, the cross is preceded by a warning signal (i.e., a beep) whilein the other condition there is no warning signal. The median reac-tion time for correctly detected crosses is calculated for each of thetwo conditions (i.e., with and without an audible warning signal).Phasic alertness re\ufb02ects optimization of the state of preparation orreactivity of a subject when the information he/she has to deal withis preceded by a signal warning of its imminent appearance.In addition to this reaction time task, two working memory taskswere administered. The \ufb01rst was the computerized working mem-ory task of the TEA1.5 battery [37] where the subject has to presson a button when a given stimulus (a digit which appears in thecentre of the screen) is identical to a stimulus shown previously(the next to last digit shown on the screen). A hundred digits from1 to 9 were presented in succession at 3-s inter-stimulus intervals.The median reaction time for correct responses and the numbersof correct responses and errors are recorded. The second workingmemory task was the computerized paced auditory serial attentiontest (PASAT) [38] where single digits are presented auditorily. Sub-jects were instructed to add each new digit to the one immediatelyprior to it. The test score is the total number of correct sums givenin each trial.Finally, two episodic memory tasks (one verbal and the othervisual) were also administered. The verbal task was the word mem-ory test (WMT) [39] . This computerized memory test measures theability to learn a list of 20 pairs of words displayed on the screen,e.g., pig/bacon. There are then six sub-tests: immediate recogni-tion (IR), delayed recognition (DR), multiple choice (MC), pairedassociates (PA), free recall (FR), and long delayed free recall (LDFR).Visual episodic memory was assessed using the \u201cDoors test\u201d [40] inwhich subjects are instructed to memorize two series of 12 picturesof doors (garage doors, front doors, etc.). Each door is shown for 3 sand then the subject is asked to recognize the door (target items)from a choice of four pictures of doors (score ranging between 0and 24).2.2.3. Cognitive fatigue assessmentIn addition to the subjective assessment of fatigue using thefatigue severity scale, we assessed fatigue more objectively byadministering the phasic alertness part of the TEA again at theend of the testing session (which took approximately an hour anda half). A fatigue index (total reaction times of Alertness test 2minus total reaction times of Alertness test 1) was calculated andcompared among groups using an ANOVA. A higher fatigue indexindicated a stronger effect of fatigue on phasic alertness.2.2.4. Suggestibility and lack of effort (simulation)We also added some tasks and/or indexes assessing suggestibil-ity and lack of effort. Suggestibility is de\ufb01ned as the tendency torespond to suggestions. The effect of suggestibility was assessed bydividing the PASAT into two equal parts. Half-way through the testthere was a pause, and the investigator said: \u201cNow, after this \ufb01rstpart of the test, you probably feel a certain degree of fatigue, whichwe will investigate before going on with the task\u201d. The subject hadto assess his/her subjective fatigue on a 7-point Likert scale (fatigueseverity scale, FSS, ranging from \u201cno fatigue\u201d to \u201cextreme fatigue\u201d).A suggestibility index (total score of PASAT 2 minus total score ofPASAT 1) was calculated and compared among the groups using anANOVA. A higher negative index indicated a greater deteriorationof scores on PASAT 2 and thus a greater response to suggestibility.For the assessment of simulation (or lack of effort), we useda speci\ufb01c task: the Amsterdam Short Memory Test (short version)[41] . This task comprises 45 items. Each item involves the presenta-tion of \ufb01ve words from a common semantic category (e.g., x, y, z, w,v). Subjects have to read the words aloud and memorize them. Theyare then distracted with a simple addition or subtraction task. Afterthis short interference task, \ufb01ve words from the original seman-tic category are presented (e.g., x, y, z, a, b). Three words are thesame as in the previous trial, and two are new and less frequent forthat category. Subjects have to indicate which three words werepresent in the \ufb01rst series (no time limit). The test score is the num-ber of correct responses; the maximum score is 45 (3 points foreach 15 items). In a preliminary study, we showed that a cut-offscore of 40/45 (the lowest score obtained by a group of patientswith marked cerebral damage and severe amnesia) was the bestthreshold to detect subjects asked to feign a memory de\ufb01cit (thesesubjects having a weaker score).In addition to this speci\ufb01c task, some index of simulation canalso be extracted from the WMT and the Doors tests. Indeed, IRand DR sub-tests from the WMT are particularly sensitive to lackof effort. The consistency of the responses from IR to DR is calcu-lated. This score allows investigation of lack of effort or simulation.The person receives a point if the correct response was chosen inthe two sub-tests or if the incorrect response was chosen in thetwo sub-tests and receives a score of zero if responses were incon-sistent for a given item, scoring \u201ccorrectly\u201d with some trials and\u201cincorrectly\u201d with others. The cut off score is <70%. Using this score,the performance of the subject can be questioned [42] . In the Doorstest, the subject\u2019s score is compared to chance performance. Indeed,it is widely recognized that amnesic patients use implicit memory(or familiarity) to recognize the target item, and perform betterthan chance in most recognition tasks. Hence, if the subject\u2019s per-formance is signi\ufb01cantly near to or less than that of chance (here25% correct which is a score of 6/24), the examiner may concludethat the examinee has intentionally chosen incorrect responses andmay have been motivated to perform inadequately [43] .2.3. Data analysisData were analyzed with Statistica 5.0. The groups were com-pared using a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). The LSDtest or planned comparisons (post hoc comparisons) were calcu-lated. The statistical signi\ufb01cance for all of the analyses was set at\u02db= .05.3. Results3.1. Depression, anxiety and subjective fatigueFirst analyses of the questionnaires (see Table 2 ) showed a sig-ni\ufb01cant main effect for each index. Post hoc analysis suggested thatpatients with CFS were more depressed than controls on the BDIand GDS questionnaires, but less depressed than the MDD group.The same pattern was observed for anxiety with patients withCFS being more anxious than the control subjects, but less anx-ious than the patients with MDD. Concerning subjective fatigue,patients with CFS were signi\ufb01cantly more tired than the depressedand control groups. Moreover, the patients with MDD had a higherfatigue score than the control group.3.2. Do patients with CFS have cognitive de\ufb01cits?Our \ufb01rst question was to verify whether patients with CFS hadcognitive impairments compared to control subjects. Results forthe CFS and control groups are presented in Table 3 . Comparedwith normal controls, patients with CFS subjects had slower totalmedian RT and median RT without signal on the \ufb01rst alertness sub-test (TEA) but not median RT with signal.

Moreover, a univariate ANOVA on thegroups showed a signi\ufb01cant main effect for group on the medianRT of response. There was no signi\ufb01cant difference between theMDD group and the controls, but both differed from the patientswith CFS who were slower. For the total PASAT scores, there was atendency for lower scores in CFS patients compared with controls,and both differed from the patients with MDD depressed who wereless effective.For the memory tasks, a univariate ANOVA on the visual mem-ory task (Doors) revealed a signi\ufb01cant main effect for group.There was no signi\ufb01cant difference in the quality of responsesbetween the MDD and CFS groups, but both differed from thecontrol group, which was more effective. A univariate ANOVA onthe WMT revealed a signi\ufb01cant main effect for group for DR, MC,FR, LDFR. For DR, MC and FR, patients with MDD and those withCFS had lower scores than controls with no difference betweenMDD and CFS patients. However, and notably, patients with CFSshowed worse performances for the LDFR compared to controlsand patients with MDD, but these latter groups did not differ fromeach other.3.4. Effect of fatigueRegarding the impact of objective fatigue, a univariate ANOVAon the fatigue index (total reaction times of Alertness test 2 minustotal reaction times of Alertness test 1), showed no signi\ufb01cant groupeffect suggesting that all groups were in\ufb02uenced equally by theeffect of fatigue.3.5. Subject\u2019s response to suggestibilityConcerning suggestibility, a univariate ANOVA on the sug-gestibility index revealed a tendency for a signi\ufb01cant main groupeffect; post hoc analysis showed only a tendency for patients withMDD to be more suggestible than patients with CFS. Within the CFSgroup now, we also observed a positive correlation between lengthof illness and the suggestibility index ( r= .4518; p= .023); suggest-ing that the longer these patients had had CFS, the more open theywere to suggestion.3.6. Lack of effort/simulationGlobally, the majority of controls and patients obtained goodscores, excluding a global lack of effort or simulation. At the indi-vidual level and considering the cut-off scores for each task: (1) nopatients obtained a score near or below chance on the Doors test;(2) only one patients with CFS and one with MDD obtained a resultunder the threshold on the ASTM (40/45); and (3) two patients withCFS and two with MDD obtained a consistency result under thethreshold on the WMT (70%).However, removing these four sub-jects from our database did not change the results for the differentcognitive tests presented earlier.3.7. Correlations between cognition and measures of depressionand subjective fatigueAre the cognitive impairments in patients with CFS associatedwith depressive symptomatology or subjective fatigue, and arethese potential associations the same as those present in patientswith MDD? To answer these questions, we evaluated correlationsbetween the main cognitive scores and BDI and GDS scores fordepression, and FSS scores for subjective fatigue ( Table 4 ). Ourresults clearly demonstrate that, for patients with CFS, surprisingly,there were no correlations between cognitive scores and subjectivefatigue, and only a few correlations between the working memorydimension (measured by PASAT and WMT) and depression, withno correlations at all for other cognitive dimensions. These resultscontrast with those of patients with MDD, for whom there werestrong correlations between most cognitive scores and not only thedepression dimension but also subjective fatigue. We also analyzedfor CFS patients whether scores on cognitive measures differedbetween the CFS patients with signi\ufb01cant depressive symptoms(GDS \u226511; BDI \u226514) and those CFS patients without the presenceof depressive symptoms (GDS < 11; BDI < 14). We did not observeany signi\ufb01cant difference between the two groups.4. DiscussionIn this study, we examined the performance of patients with CFSduring different cognitive tasks because there is still debate con-cerning the presence and interpretation of cognitive impairmentsin patients with CFS, with some studies showing cognitive impair-ment and others not. If there are cognitive de\ufb01cits in CFS patients,300 E.L. Constant et al. / Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 (2011) 295\u2013302the question is then to know whether these are core features ofthe condition or an indirect consequence of other aspects of associ-ated comorbitities, one of the most important being depression. Inthis context, the cognitive performances of patients with CFS werecompared with those of healthy controls.Our results clearly demonstrate cognitive impairment inpatients with CFS and, more importantly, that it cannot beexplained by a lack of effort. Indeed, in terms of the subjects\u2019involvement in the task, we observed very good global perfor-mances not only for patients with MDD but also for those with CFS.Also, importantly, the cognitive impairments remained signi\ufb01cantafter the few patients who showed a lack of effort ( n= 4 among atotal of 50 patients) were removed from our database.The patients with CFS differed from the control group in severalaspects. We observed that the patients with CFS were signi\ufb01-cantly more anxious, more depressed, and more tired than thehealthy controls. The overall results of the cognitive tests showedthat, relative to healthy controls, cognition was weaker among thepatients with CFS. Analyses based on the group comparisons leadto the conclusion that the patients with CFS showed an impaired ormarkedly decreased ability to maintain attention and alertness. Thepatients with CFS had slower phasic alertness. They also showedimpairments in one working memory test (TEA) and a tendency toimpairments in another (PASAT) and in long-term memory (visualand verbal), compared with the controls.How can we interpret these cognitive impairments? Are theydirectly linked to the pathophysiological mechanism of CFS or dothey re\ufb02ect an indirect consequence of the depressive symptomsoften observed in this condition? Two arguments suggest that thecognitive de\ufb01cits in CFS are core symptoms of the condition and arenot the consequence of the depression dimension of the disorder.First, when we compared the performances of patients with CFS andthose with MDD, there were several differences: the patients withCFS were signi\ufb01cantly less anxious and less depressed, but morefatigued than the patients with MDD. These results are in line withother papers. Using the BDI, Short et al. [25] and DeLuca et al. [44]reported that subjects with CFS were more depressed than con-trols. Cope et al. [3] and DeLuca et al. [10] , on the other hand, foundthat subjects with CFS were less depressed than depressed patients.Using the STAI, Riccio et al. [8]and Cope et al. [3]reported that therewere no differences between patients with CFS and controls. How-ever, DeLuca et al. [10] found that patients with CFS were moreanxious than controls but less anxious than depressed subjects,similar to the results of the present study. Finally, the literaturealso reports that subjects with CFS are more tired than controls[44,45] and more tired than depressed subjects [10] . For the cog-nitive tests, patients with CFS and those with MDD also differed inseveral aspects. There were three differences for the reaction timeand accuracy measures we used: the patients with CFS were slowerin the TEA working memory test and obtained a better accuracyscore on the PASAT test than the patients with MDD. It is also veryinteresting to note that patients with CFS were more impaired onthe long delay free recall of the WMT than patients with MDD. Thisindex is probably the most sensitive for the detection of memorydif\ufb01culties.The second argument for considering that cognitive de\ufb01citsare core symptoms of CFS comes from the correlation analyses.Although, as expected, cognitive impairments in patients with MDDwere strongly associated with depression and subjective fatigue, inpatients with CFS we only observed: (1) a weak correlation betweenworking memory index and depression; (2) no correlation at allfor the other cognitive dimensions and depression; and (3) no cor-relation between cognitive measures and subjective fatigue. Ourresults are in line with those of several authors [3\u20135,13,15,22\u201325]who have shown that symptoms of depression do not correlate sig-ni\ufb01cantly with a variety of neuropsychological measures, althoughother studies [6,7,11,17,21] have reported such a correlation. Asdiscussed by others [23] , the fact that, in this study, MDD and CFSpatients differed in several aspects is not surprising. From a neu-robiological point of view, there are also differences: hypoactivityof the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is usually observed inCFS, in contrast to the hyperactivity of this axis in MDD [46\u201348] .Interestingly, in an atypical subtype of MDD (with hypersomnia,leaden paralysis, mood reactivity, interpersonal rejection sensitiv-ity), hypoactivity of this axis is also observed [46,47] .Our results show that globally the patients with CFS were nomore sensitive to suggestibility than the other two groups and, infact, were less suggestible than the patients with MDD. Our resultsdo not replicate the \ufb01ndings of DiClementi et al. [29] , who observedthat patients with CFS were more suggestible than controls on ameasure of general suggestibility (recall task of history) and on thehypnotic induction pro\ufb01le (HIP) [30] . The HIP is a brief structuredtechnique that measures behavioural, perceptual, and cognitiveresponses to suggestions. Subjects are asked to perform an eyeroll and then, once their eyelids are closed, the hypnotic inductioninvolves suggestions by the examiner of \ufb02oating and arm levita-tion. In that study, induction scores for the CFS group were higherthan those for controls. It is important here to specify that sug-gestibility is not synonymous with gullibility. Suggestibility refersto a type of information processing that is selective and distortedin that relevant information cannot be handled in a balanced fash-ion. According to DiClementi et al. [29] , \u201csuggestible persons withCFS do experience the symptoms they report. However, a tendencyto focus on symptoms, perhaps to the exclusion of other infor-mation, may be related to CFS patients\u2019 dif\ufb01culties in processingcomplex cognitive information, and dif\ufb01culties with divided atten-tion\u201d (pp. 684\u2013685). In line with this argument, it is important tonote that although, in our study, patients with CFS were not moresuggestible than the two other groups, there was a positive corre-lation between length of illness and the suggestibility index. Thismay mean that the longer the CFS illness, the more patients focuson their symptoms and if someone else focuses their attention ontheir symptoms, they will show a greater response to that sugges-tion and this process will impair the realization of the cognitivetask in which they are involved.As regards the impact of fatigue, there were no signi\ufb01cant dif-ferences among the three groups on the fatigue index. These resultsare in line with the observations of most other authors [5,6,25\u201327]who found no relationship between the level of fatigue in patientswith CFS and their performance on cognitive tests. However, Joyceet al. [13] did \ufb01nd one relationship between these parameters.It is interesting to note that in another condition, the post-poliosyndrome, Ostlund et al. [28] also found no relationship betweengeneral fatigue and cognitive de\ufb01cits. However, it is important toremember that the fact that we did not observe a direct effectof fatigue on cognitive variables does not mean that, at the brainlevel, the mental fatigue induced by our task did not have differ-ent consequences on brain activity in our three study populations.In a functional neuroimaging study, Cook et al. [49] observed that,compared with normal controls, patients with CFS did not differin \ufb01nger tapping or auditory monitoring tasks (PASAT), but exhib-ited signi\ufb01cantly greater activity in several cortical and subcorticalregions during the fatiguing cognitive task (PASAT). In particular,compared to controls, patients with CFS exhibited greater utiliza-tion of brain regions within the working memory system in orderto successfully complete the PASAT. These results, therefore, sug-gest an association between subjective feelings of mental fatigueand brain responses during a fatiguing cognition. Moreover, thefact that, in this study, the objective effect of fatigue on cognitionwas not larger than in the two other groups does not mean that thesubjective impression of fatigue would not be higher in patientswith CFS. Grafman et al. [5] investigated the relationship betweenE.L. Constant et al. / Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 (2011) 295\u2013302 301the subjective memory complaints of patients with CFS and theirlevel of fatigue and found that there was evidence of a positiverelationship.Finally, the present study has methodological issues that need tobe addressed. First, the MDD group did not strictly match the othergroups in years of education. However, we believe that this cannotexplain the results observed in the cognitive tests. After adjustingfor years of education as covariates, we observed the same resultsin the different cognitive tests. Second, maximum age in the CFSgroup was 55, in the MDD group 68, and in the control group 64.Especially for the MDD and control group there were some olderpersons included. We know that aging has also a deteriorating effecton cognitive functioning although we do not think it would haveimpacted substantially the current outcomes. Third, the patientswith MDD were typically outpatients without atypical depressionor melancholic depression, so the results of the present study can-not be extended to all types of patients with MDD. Moreover, itcould have been their \ufb01rst major depressive episode or a recur-rent one. Some may argue that patients with recurrent depressiveepisodes are more at risk of cognitive impairments. Fourth, we usedtwo self-administered questionnaires (BDI and GDS) to investigatedepression and not the Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS)administered by a clinician. Some may argue that subjectivity ismore often re\ufb02ected in the BDI scores than in the HDRS. We choseto use self-administered questionnaires because two psychologistsparticipated in the evaluation of the patients and we wanted toavoid interjudge variability. Moreover, in the GDS, physical symp-toms are excluded, which is important for the assessment of thedepressive dimension in patients with CFS. Fifth, although the con-trols were not included if they were taking psychotropic drugs, thiswas not the case for the patients with MDD or CFS, and psychotropicdrugs may in\ufb02uence cognition. Nevertheless, it is almost impossibleto conduct such a study in drug naive patients and we can argue thatour patients are at least highly representative of patients seen indaily practice. Finally, it would have been interesting to investigatethe suggestibility and fatigue dimensions with more than one cog-nitive test. It would have been interesting also to investigate othertypes of executive functions. Future research in this \ufb01eld shouldalso compare cognition in subgroups with similar neurobiological\ufb01ndings, for example, patients with atypical MDD or CFS.In conclusion, the present study con\ufb01rms the presence of objec-tive impairment in attention and memory in patients with CFSbut with good mobilization of effort and without exaggerated sug-gestibility.FundingNo \ufb01nancial support was received for the work.Con\ufb02icts of interestThere are no con\ufb02icts of interest.References[1] Fukuda K, Straus SE, Hickie I, Sharpe MC, Dobbins JG, Komaroff A, Interna-tional Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group.
