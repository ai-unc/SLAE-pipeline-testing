We evaluated the cognitive performance of patients with CFS in comparison with a control\ngroup of healthy volunteers and a group of patients with MDD.\n\nPatients and methods: Twenty-five patients with CFS, 25 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD),\nand 25 healthy control subjects were given standardized tests of attention, working memory, and ver-\n\nKeywords: bal and visual episodic memory, and were also tested for effects related to lack of effort/simulation,\nronic fatigue syndrome 1 1!\n\nDepression suggestibility, and fatigue.\n\nCognition Results: Patients with CFS had slower phasic alertness, and also had impaired working, visual and verbal\nAttention episodic memory compared to controls. They were, however, no more sensitive than the other groups to\nMemory suggestibility or to fatigue induced during the cognitive session. Cognitive impairments in MDD patients\n\n\u2018were strongly associated with depression and subjective fatigue; in patients with CFS, there was a weaker\ncorrelation between cognition and depression (and no correlation with fatigue).\nConclusions: This study confirms the presence of an objective impairment in attention and memory in\npatients with CFS but with good mobilization of effort and without exaggerated suggestibility.\n\n\u00a92011 Elsevier BV.

Introduction Subjective ratings of cognitive competence are poor predictors of\n\nlaboratory results [7], because they can be based on factors other\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)is a debilitating condition that s\ncharacterized by chronic fatigue, impairment of short-term mem-\nory and musculoskeletal pain [1]. CFS is marked by persistent or\nrelapsing debilitating fatigue that: (1) does not resolve with bed\nrest; (2) is severe enough to reduce daily activity; and (3) has no\nsomatic explanation [2]. A number of symptoms may be present,\nincluding myalgia, headache, sore throat, and pains in the joints.\nCognitive complaints are also frequently reported, particularly in\nrelation to memory and concentration [3-7]. However, although\npatients with CFS often complain of cognitive difficulties, neu-\nropsychological studies that have attempted to objectively measure\ncognitive deficits in such patients have yielded conflicting results.\n\n# Data presented at the APA meeting in Washington, May 6, 2008, poster NR5-047.\n* Corresponding author at: Service de psychiatrie, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-\nLuc, Avenue Hippocrate 10, 1200 Bruxelles, Belgium, Tel.: +32 2 764 21 75;\nfax: +322 76489 21\nE-mail address: Eric.Constant@uclouvain be (E.L Constant).\n\n0303-8467/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Data are less consistent for attention\nand memory: some authors have reported impairment in ver-\nbal memory [5,10,13], visual memory [5], concentration [6,11,13],\nattention span [6], reaction times [14-16], and speed of infor-\nmation processing [4,10], while others found no abnormalities in\nverbal memory [3,12,13,15], visual memory [3,5,11,17], concentra-\ntion [7,10], attention span [5,6,10,11], or reaction times [5]. These\nconflicting results raise questions about the methodology of these\nstudies and the objectivity of the tests used to assess the cognitive\nimpairments. There is, indeed, a marked discrepancy between sub-\njective complaints and objective performance that casts doubt on\nthe validity of the cognitive symptoms. In one study [10], despite\nno memory deficits on neuropsychological tests, patients with\nCFS had more subjective complaints of cognitive impairment on\n\n\n296 EL Constant et al. / Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 (2011) 295-302\n\nTable 1\nGroups description.\n\nn Age Sex Years of education Length of illness (in years)\nMean sD.

Such an explanation would suffice if a correlation\nbetween symptoms of depression and anxiety and certain neu-\nropsychological measures had been observed (as for example in\nstudies [6,7,11,17,21]). However, this is not the case in all studies\n[3-5.13,15,22-25]. In addition, the possible direct effect of fatigue\non cognitive performance in CFS has also been examined. Although\nmost authors [5,6,25-27] found no relationship between the level\nof fatigue and performance on memory and attention tests, one was\nnoted by Joyce et al. [13]. Thus, the direct effect of fatigue on cogni-\ntive performance in CFS remains unclear. In another condition, the\npost-polio syndrome, Ostlund et al. [28] also did not find a relation-\nship between general fatigue and cognitive deficits. Finally, there\nare multiple methodological difficulties in the neuropsychological\nliterature on CFS, for example, heterogeneity in the diagnosis of CFS\nacross studies, presence of comorbid depression, and lack of control\ngroups.\n\nIt is, therefore, difficult to clarify whether there are objective\ncognitive deficits in patients with CFS, particularly in terms of mem-\nory and executive functions, or whether the cognitive impairments\nare directly associated with the depressive symptoms in this con-\ndition. Hence, we evaluated as a primary objective, the cognitive\nperformance of patients with CFS using standardized verbal and\nvisual memory tests, as well as sustained attention, phasic alert-\nness, and the fatigue effect, compared with a control group of\nhealthy volunteers. We investigated the same variables in a group\nof patients with MDD. Particular attention was paid to the evalua-\ntion of the quantitative dimension of depressive symptoms in the\npatients with CFS. Investigation of attention and memory functions\nwas chosen because these are the functions most often reported\nas impaired in CFS but also in MDD. Our primary hypothesis was\nthat patients with CFS would have cognitive impairments that were\nonly partially correlated with the depressive dimension of the con-\ndition, suggesting that some cognitive impairments may be present\nindependent of the depressive dimension. The partial relationship\nbetween cognitive and depressive symptomatology could be con-\nfirmed by direct comparison with the MDD group.\n\nIn addition to these primary objectives, we wanted to inves-\ntigate the possible gap between the subjective and objective\ndimensions of cognition, as some studies have reported more\nsubjective complaints than objective impairments. Our secondary\nobjectives were, therefore, to examine the subjects\u2019 reactions to\nsuggestibility. Some authors [29] have argued that subjects with\nCFS are more suggestible than healthy persons using a measure of\ngeneral suggestibility and the hypnotic induction profile (HIP) [30].\nAnother way to approach this question would be to investigate task\ninvolvement in order to exclude deficit feigning and the attribution\nof cognitive deficits to the possibility that CFS patients may be less\nthan optimally motivated in the tasks (thus expending less effort\nbecause of a metacognitive belief of cognitive impairment).\n\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Subjects\n\nWe studied 25 patients with CFS, 25 patients with MDD,\nand 25 healthy control subjects (see Table 1 for demographic\nparameters of these three groups). All of the participants were\nright-handed. There was no significant among-group difference\nfor age [F(2.72)= 52]. There was a significant difference\nin degree of education among the three groups [F(2,72]=10.41;\np<.01], with the MDD group having fewer years of education than\nthe CFS and control groups (both p<.01). The groups were compa-\nrable for gender [x2(2, 75)=3.86, p>.10].\n\nAll the CFS patients met the diagnostic criterion for CFS, i.e., at\nleast six months of unexplained disabling fatigue [1,2]. CFS subjects\nwere recruited from the Referral Centre for CFS and MDD patients\nfrom the outpatient psychiatric unit of the Cliniques Universitaires\nSaint-Luc, Brussels. The healthy controls were recruited from the\ncare staff and volunteers of the Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc\nand from volunteer associations. Before entering the study, patients\nand controls gave their informed consent to a protocol approved by\nthe Medical Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of the Uni-\nversit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain. The patients and the control subjects\nunderwent a psychiatric interview supplemented by the Structural\nClinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) [31] to confirm\nthe diagnosis of unipolar major depressive episodes in the patients\nwith MDD and the absence of any Axis | psychiatric disorder in\nthe controls and the patients with CFS (in particular the absence of\nMDD). Exclusion criteria for the control subjects were unexplained\nfatigue, an organic condition that causes fatigue, an unstable med-\nical condition, an organic brain disorder, the use of psychotropic\ndrugs, and a current or past mental disorder on the basis of the\nSCID I interview.\n\n2.2. Procedure\n\n22.1. Self-questionnaires\n\nSeveral scales were used to assess anxiety, depression, and\nfatigue. The 40-item State Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale (STAI A\n&B) [32] assesses anxiety symptoms. The first sub-scale indicates\nthe state of anxiety at the moment of the session (STAI-A); the\nsecond sub-scale indicates the subject's anxiety traits (STAI-B).\nThe results are converted into T-scores. A French version of the\n21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [33] assesses depression\nin adults [34]. The scores range from 0 to 63. A score of 13 or\nless indicates a non-depressed state; a score from 14 to 19 corre-\nsponds to \u201cmildly depressed\u201d; and a score over 20 indicates clinical\ndepression. The geriatric depression scale (GDS) [35] is a 30-item\ninstrument for assessing depression. The value of this questionnaire\nis that physical symptoms are excluded, whereas other instruments\nof depression assessment are too rich in somatic symptoms and\ntoo poor in cognitive symptoms. Scores range from 0 to 30. A score\nof 10 or less is considered to indicate the absence of depressive\nsymptoms, and a score over 11 reflects the presence of depressive\nsymptoms, The fatigue severity scale (FSS) [36] is a 9-item scale\nassessing \u201cdisabling fatigue\u201d. Total scores range from 9 to 63. The\nhigher the score, the more the fatigue is disabling.\n\n\nEL Constant et al. / Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 (2011) 295-302 29\n\n2.2.2. Cognitive tasks\n\nAttention was assessed with one computerized reaction time\ntest: the Phasic Alertness Task of the TEAL battery [37]. In this\ntask, the subjectis instructed to press a button as quickly as possible\nas soon as a cross appears in the centre of the screen. In one con-\ndition, the cross is preceded by a warning signal (i.e. a beep) while\nin the other condition there is no warning signal. The median reac-\ntion time for correctly detected crosses is calculated for each of the\ntwo conditions (i.e. with and without an audible warning signal).\nPhasic alertness reflects optimization of the state of preparation or\nreactivity of a subject when the information he/she has to deal with\nis preceded by a signal warning of its imminent appearance.\n\nInaddition to this reaction time task, two working memory tasks\nwere administered. The first was the computerized working mem-\nory task of the TEA1.5 battery [37] where the subject has to press\non a button when a given stimulus (a digit which appears in the\ncentre of the screen) is identical to a stimulus shown previously\n(the next to last digit shown on the screen). A hundred digits from\n1 to 9 were presented in succession at 3-s inter-stimulus intervals.\nThe median reaction time for correct responses and the numbers\nof correct responses and errors are recorded. The second working\nmemory task was the computerized paced auditory serial attention\ntest (PASAT) [38] where single digits are presented auditorily. Sub-\njects were instructed to add each new digit to the one immediately\nprior to it. The test score is the total number of correct sums given\nin each trial.\n\nFinally, two episodic memory tasks (one verbal and the other\nvisual) were also administered. The verbal task was the word mem-\nory test (WMT) 39]. This computerized memory test measures the\nability to learn a list of 20 pairs of words displayed on the screen,\ne.g. pig/bacon. There are then six sub-tests: immediate recogni-\ntion (IR), delayed recognition (DR), multiple choice (MC), paired\nassociates (PA), free recall (FR), and long delayed free recall (LDFR).\nVisual episodic memory was assessed using the \u201cDoors test\u201d [40] in\nwhich subjects are instructed to memorize two series of 12 pictures\nof doors (garage doors, front doors, etc.). Each door is shown for 3s\nand then the subject is asked to recognize the door (target items)\nfrom a choice of four pictures of doors (score ranging between 0\nand 24).\n\n2.2.3. Cognitive fatigue assessment\n\nIn addition to the subjective assessment of fatigue using the\nfatigue severity scale, we assessed fatigue more objectively by\nadministering the phasic alertness part of the TEA again at the\nend of the testing session (which took approximately an hour and\na half). A fatigue index (total reaction times of Alertness test 2\nminus total reaction times of Alertness test 1) was calculated and\ncompared among groups using an ANOVA. A higher fatigue index\nindicated a stronger effect of fatigue on phasic alertness.\n\n2.2.4. Suggestibility and lack of effort (simulation)\n\nWe also added some tasks and/or indexes assessing suggestibil-\nity and lack of effort. Suggestibility is defined as the tendency to\nrespond to suggestions. The effect of suggestibility was assessed by\ndividing the PASAT into two equal parts. Half-way through the test\nthere was a pause, and the investigator said: \u201cNow, after this first\npart of the test, you probably feel a certain degree of fatigue, which\nwe will investigate before going on with the task\u201d. The subject had\ntoassess his/her subjective fatigue on a 7-point Likert scale (fatigue\nseverity scale, FSS, ranging from \u201cno fatigue\u201d to \u201cextreme fatigue\u201d).\nA suggestibility index (total score of PASAT 2 minus total score of\nPASAT 1) was calculated and compared among the groups using an\nANOVA. A higher negative index indicated a greater deterioration\nof scores on PASAT 2 and thus a greater response to suggestibility.\n\nFor the assessment of simulation (or lack of effort), we used\na specific task: the Amsterdam Short Memory Test (short version)\n\n[41]. This task comprises 45 items. Each item involves the presenta-\ntion of five words from a common semantic category (\u20ac.8.,. ZW,\nv). Subjects have to read the words aloud and memorize them. They\nare then distracted with a simple addition or subtraction task. After\nthis short interference task, five words from the original seman-\ntic category are presented (e.g., X, y, z, a, b). Three words are the\nsame as in the previous trial, and two are new and less frequent for\nthat category. Subjects have to indicate which three words were\npresent in the first series (no time limit). The test score is the num-\nber of correct responses; the maximum score is 45 (3 points for\neach 15 items). In a preliminary study, we showed that a cut-off\nscore of 40/45 (the lowest score obtained by a group of patients\nwith marked cerebral damage and severe amnesia) was the best\nthreshold to detect subjects asked to feign a memory deficit (these\nsubjects having a weaker score).\n\nIn addition to this specific task, some index of simulation can\nalso be extracted from the WMT and the Doors tests. Indeed, IR\nand DR sub-tests from the WMT are particularly sensitive to lack\nof effort. The consistency of the responses from IR to DR is calcu-\nlated. This score allows investigation of lack of effort or simulation.\nThe person receives a point if the correct response was chosen in\nthe two sub-tests or if the incorrect response was chosen in the\ntwo sub-tests and receives a score of zero if responses were incon-\nsistent for a given item, scoring \u201ccorrectly\u201d with some trials and\n\u201cincorrectly\u201d with others. The cut off score is <70%. Using this score,\nthe performance of the subject can be questioned [42]. In the Doors\ntest, the subject's score is compared to chance performance. Indeed,\nitis widely recognized that amnesic patients use implicit memory\n(or familiarity) to recognize the target item, and perform better\nthan chance in most recognition tasks. Hence, if the subject's per-\nformance is significantly near to or less than that of chance (here\n25% correct which is a score of 6/24), the examiner may conclude\nthat the examinee has intentionally chosen incorrect responses and\nmay have been motivated to perform inadequately [43].\n\n23. Data analysis\n\nData were analyzed with Statistica 5.0. The groups were com-\npared using a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). The LSD\ntest or planned comparisons (post hoc comparisons) were calcu-\nlated. The statistical significance for all of the analyses was set at\na=.05.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Depression, anxiety and subjective fatigue\n\nbut less depressed than the MDD group.\n\nious than the patients with MDD.

Correlations between cognition and measures of depression\nand subjective fatigue\n\nAre the cognitive impairments in patients with CFS associated\nwith depressive symptomatology or subjective fatigue, and are\nthese potential associations the same as those present in patients\nwith MDD? To answer these questions, we evaluated correlations\nbetween the main cognitive scores and BDI and GDS scores for\ndepression, and FSS scores for subjective fatigue (Table 4). Our\n\nfatigue, and only a few correlations between the working memory\ndimension (measured by PASAT and WMT) and depression, with\nno correlations at all for other cognitive dimensions. These results\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn this study, we examined the performance of patients with CFS\nduring different cognitive tasks because there is still debate con-\ncerning the presence and interpretation of cognitive impairments\nin patients with CFS, with some studies showing cognitive impair-\nment and others not. If there are cognitive deficits in CFS patients,\n\n\n300 EL Constant et al. / Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 (2011) 295-302\n\nthe question is then to know whether these are core features of\nthe condition or an indirect consequence of other aspects of associ\nated comorbitities, one of the most important being depression. In\nthis context, the cognitive performances of patients with CFS were\ncompared with those of healthy controls.\n\nOur results clearly demonstrate cognitive impairment in\npatients with CFS and, more importantly, that it cannot be\nexplained by a lack of effort. Indeed, in terms of the subjects\u2019\ninvolvement in the task, we observed very good global perfor-\nmances not only for patients with MDD but also for those with CFS.\nAlso, importantly, the cognitive impairments remained significant\nafter the few patients who showed a lack of effort (n=4 among a\ntotal of 50 patients) were removed from our database.\n\nThe patients with CFS differed from the control group in several\naspects. We observed that the patients with CFS were signifi-\ncantly more anxious, more depressed, and more tired than the\nhealthy controls. The overall results of the cognitive tests showed\nthat, relative to healthy controls, cognition was weaker among the\npatients with CFS. Analyses based on the group comparisons lead\nto the conclusion that the patients with CFS showed an impaired or\nmarkedly decreased ability to maintain attention and alertness. The\npatients with CFS had slower phasic alertness. They also showed\nimpairments in one working memory test (TEA) and a tendency to\nimpairments in another (PASAT) and in long-term memory (visual\nand verbal), compared with the controls.\n\nHow can we interpret these cognitive impairments? Are they\ndirectly linked to the pathophysiological mechanism of CFS or do\nthey reflect an indirect consequence of the depressive symptoms\noften observed in this condition? Two arguments suggest that the\ncognitive deficits in CFS are core symptoms of the condition and are\nnot the consequence of the depression dimension of the disorder.\nFirst, when we compared the performances of patients with CFS and\nthose with MDD, there were several differences: the patients with\nCFS were significantly less anxious and less depressed, but more\nfatigued than the patients with MDD. These results are in line with\nother papers. Using the BDI, Short et al. [25] and DeLuca et al. [44]\nreported that subjects with CFS were more depressed than con-\ntrols. Cope et al. [3] and DeLuca et al. [10], on the other hand, found\nthat subjects with CFS were less depressed than depressed patients.\nUsing the STAI Riccio et al. [8] and Cope etal. [3] reported that there\nwere no differences between patients with CFS and controls. How-\never, DeLuca et al. [10] found that patients with CFS were more\nanxious than controls but less anxious than depressed subjects,\nsimilar to the results of the present study. Finally, the literature\nalso reports that subjects with CFS are more tired than controls\n[44,45] and more tired than depressed subjects [10]. For the cog-\nnitive tests, patients with CFS and those with MDD also differed in\nseveral aspects. There were three differences for the reaction time\nand accuracy measures we used: the patients with CFS were slower\nin the TEA working memory test and obtained a better accuracy\nscore on the PASAT test than the patients with MDD. It is also very\ninteresting to note that patients with CFS were more impaired on\nthe long delay free recall of the WMT than patients with MDD. This\nindex is probably the most sensitive for the detection of memory\ndifficulties.\n\nThe second argument for considering that cognitive deficits\nare core symptoms of CFS comes from the correlation analyses.\nAlthough, as expected, cognitive impairments in patients with MDD\nwere strongly associated with depression and subjective fatigue, in\npatients with CFS we only observed: (1)aweak correlation between\nworking memory index and depression; (2) no correlation at all\nfor the other cognitive dimensions and depression; and (3) no cor-\nrelation between cognitive measures and subjective fatigue. Our\nresults are in line with those of several authors [3-5,13,15,22-25]\nwho have shown that symptoms of depression do not correlate sig-\nnificantly with a variety of neuropsychological measures, although\n\nother studies [6,7,11,17,21] have reported such a correlation. As\ndiscussed by others [23], the fact that, in this study, MDD and CFS\npatients differed in several aspects is not surprising. From a neu-\nrobiological point of view, there are also differences: hypoactivity\nof the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is usually observed in\nCFS, in contrast to the hyperactivity of this axis in MDD [46-48].\nInterestingly, in an atypical subtype of MDD (with hypersomnia,\nleaden paralysis, mood reactivity, interpersonal rejection sensitiv-\nity), hypoactivity of this axis is also observed [46,47].\n\nOur results show that globally the patients with CFS were no\nmore sensitive to suggestibility than the other two groups and, in\nfact, were less suggestible than the patients with MDD. Our results\ndo not replicate the findings of DiClementi et al. [29], who observed\nthat patients with CFS were more suggestible than controls on a\nmeasure of general suggestibility (recall task of history) and on the\nhypnotic induction profile (HIP) [30]. The HIP is a brief structured\ntechnique that measures behavioural, perceptual, and cognitive\nresponses to suggestions. Subjects are asked to perform an eye\nroll and then, once their eyelids are closed, the hypnotic induction\ninvolves suggestions by the examiner of floating and arm levita-\ntion. In that study, induction scores for the CFS group were higher\nthan those for controls. It is important here to specify that sug-\ngestibility is not synonymous with gullibility. Suggestibility refers\nto a type of information processing that is selective and distorted\nin that relevant information cannot be handled in a balanced fash-\nion. According to DiClementi et al. [29], \u201csuggestible persons with\nCFS do experience the symptoms they report. However, a tendency\nto focus on symptoms, perhaps to the exclusion of other infor-\nmation, may be related to CFS patients\u2019 difficulties in processing\ncomplex cognitive information, and difficulties with divided atten-\ntion\u201d (pp. 684-685). In line with this argument, it is important to\nnote that although, in our study, patients with CFS were not more\nsuggestible than the two other groups, there was a positive corre-\nlation between length of illness and the suggestibility index. This\nmay mean that the longer the CFS illness, the more patients focus\non their symptoms and if someone else focuses their attention on\ntheir symptoms, they will show a greater response to that sugges-\ntion and this process will impair the realization of the cognitive\ntask in which they are involved.\n\nAs regards the impact of fatigue, there were no significant dif-\nferences among the three groups on the fatigue index. These results\nare in line with the observations of most other authors [5,6,25-27]\nwho found no relationship between the level of fatigue in patients\nwith CFS and their performance on cognitive tests. However, Joyce\net al. [13] did find one relationship between these parameters.\nIt is interesting to note that in another condition, the post-polio\nsyndrome, Ostlund et al. [28] also found no relationship between\ngeneral fatigue and cognitive deficits. However, it is important to\nremember that the fact that we did not observe a direct effect\nof fatigue on cognitive variables does not mean that, at the brain\nlevel, the mental fatigue induced by our task did not have differ-\nent consequences on brain activity in our three study populations.\nIn a functional neuroimaging study, Cook et al. [49] observed that,\ncompared with normal controls, patients with CFS did not differ\nin finger tapping or auditory monitoring tasks (PASAT), but exhib-\nited significantly greater activity in several cortical and subcortical\nregions during the fatiguing cognitive task (PASAT). In particular,\ncompared to controls, patients with CFS exhibited greater utiliza-\ntion of brain regions within the working memory system in order\nto successfully complete the PASAT. These results, therefore, sug-\ngest an association between subjective feelings of mental fatigue\nand brain responses during a fatiguing cognition. Moreover, the\nfact that, in this study, the objective effect of fatigue on cognition\nwas not larger than in the two other groups does not mean that the\nsubjective impression of fatigue would not be higher in patients\nwith CFS. Grafman et al. [5] investigated the relationship between\n\n\nEL Constant et al. / Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 (2011) 295-302 301\n\nthe subjective memory complaints of patients with CFS and their\nlevel of fatigue and found that there was evidence of a positive\nrelationship.\n\nFinally, the present study has methodological issues that need to\nbe addressed. First, the MDD group did not strictly match the other\ngroups in years of education. However, we believe that this cannot\nexplain the results observed in the cognitive tests. After adjusting\nfor years of education as covariates, we observed the same results\nin the different cognitive tests. Second, maximum age in the CFS\ngroup was 55, in the MDD group 68, and in the control group 64.\nEspecially for the MDD and control group there were some older\npersonsincluded. We know that aging has also a deteriorating effect\non cognitive functioning although we do not think it would have\nimpacted substantially the current outcomes. Third, the patients\nwith MDD were typically outpatients without atypical depression\nor melancholic depression, so the results of the present study can-\nnot be extended to all types of patients with MDD. Moreover, it\ncould have been their first major depressive episode or a recur-\nrent one. Some may argue that patients with recurrent depressive\nepisodes are more at risk of cognitive impairments. Fourth, we used\ntwo self-administered questionnaires (BDI and GDS) to investigate\ndepression and not the Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS)\nadministered by a clinician. Some may argue that subjectivity is\nmore often reflected in the BDI scores than in the HDRS. We chose\nto use self-administered questionnaires because two psychologists\nparticipated in the evaluation of the patients and we wanted to\navoid interjudge variability. Moreover, in the GDS, physical symp-\ntoms are excluded, which is important for the assessment of the\ndepressive dimension in patients with CFS. Fifth, although the con-\ntrols were not included if they were taking psychotropic drugs, this\nwas not the case for the patients with MDD or CFS, and psychotropic\ndrugs may influence cognition. Nevertheless, itis almost impossible\nto conduct sucha study in drug naive patients and we can argue that\nour patients are at least highly representative of patients seen in\ndaily practice. Finally, it would have been interesting to investigate\nthe suggestibility and fatigue dimensions with more than one cog-\nnitive test. It would have been interesting also to investigate other\ntypes of executive functions. Future research in this field should\nalso compare cognition in subgroups with similar neurobiological\nfindings, for example, patients with atypical MDD or CFS.\n\nIn conclusion, the present study confirms the presence of objec-\ntive impairment in attention and memory in patients with CFS\nbut with good mobilization of effort and without exaggerated sug-\ngestibility.\n\nFunding\nNo financial support was received for the work.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Fukuda K, Straus SE, Hickie I, Sharpe MC, Dobbins JG, Komaroff A, Interna-\ntional Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group.
