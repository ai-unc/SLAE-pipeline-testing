Whilst some clinical predictors of recurrence have been clearly demonstrated (e.g. residual symptoms,previous episodes), the cognitive and psychological processes that may contribute to recurrence risk are less wellestablished. In this study we examine whether cognitive \ufb02exibility de \ufb01cits and rumination are related to re-currence in a remitted clinical sample.Method: We compared remitted patients with 2 or more previous depressive episodes ( N= 69) to a matchedgroup of healthy controls ( N= 43). Cognitive \ufb02exibility was measured using the Internal Shift Task (IST) and aversion of the Exogenous Cueing Task (ECT); rumination was assessed with the Ruminative Responses Scale.Results: IST and ECT performance did not di \ufb00er between remitted patients and controls. Remitted patients hadhigher levels of rumination than controls. Within the remitted patient group, faster disengagement from angryand happy faces on the ECT was predictive of shorter time to recurrence (hazard ratio for 1 standard deviation,(HRSD) = 0.563 [CI, 0.381 \u20130.832], p= 0.004, (HR SD) = 0.561 [CI, 0.389 \u20130.808], p= 0.002, respectively).Rumination predicted recurrence (HR SD= 1.526 [CI, 1.152 \u20132.202]; p= 0.003) but was not related to emotionaldisengagement.Limitations: We had low power to detect small e\ufb00 ects for the analysis within remitted patients.Conclusions: Whilst cognitive \ufb02exibility in remitted patients was not impaired relative to controls, rapid dis-engagement from emotional stimuli and rumination were independently associated with time to recurrence.Cognitive \ufb02exibility may be an important indicator of recurrence risk, and a target for interventions to reducerecurrence.1. IntroductionOf all psychiatric disorders, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) isranked as the single largest contributor to global disability(World Health Organisation, 2017). An important factor that adds tothe large burden of MDD is the high risk of recurrence after remissionfrom a depressive episode. MDD recurrence rates are typically reportedto be above 50% ( Eaton et al., 2008; Hardeveld et al., 2013; Steinertet al., 2014), with rates as high as 90% within 10\u2013 15 years in clinicalsamples with 3 or more previous episodes ( Beshai et al., 2011; Bocktinget al., 2015). Clinical characteristics such as the number of previousepisodes and residual symptoms have been identi \ufb01ed as among thestrongest predictors of recurrence ( Hardeveld et al., 2010; Kessinget al., 2004 ). Whether cognitive and psychological processes associatedwith MDD (e.g. habitual maladaptive thinking patterns, de \ufb01cits orbiases in cognition) predict recurrence of MDD is less well established.One important cognitive risk factor for MDD is rumination: a type ofrepetitive negative thinking (RNT), that has been de \ufb01ned as \u2018repeti-tively and passively focusing on the symptoms of distress and thepossible causes and consequences of these symptoms' ( Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008 ). High levels of rumination have been con-sistently shown to predict the onset, severity and maintenance of de-pressive episodes ( Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008; Watkins, 2008 ). Fur-ther, residual rumination during remission from earlier episodes ishttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2019.05.072Received 24 March 2019; Received in revised form 27 May 2019; Accepted 29 May 2019\u204eCorresponding author at: 102 Haviland Hall, School of Social Welfare, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.E-mail addresses: c.a.\ufb01gueroa@berkeley.edu (C.A.

Asmall number of studies have speci \ufb01cally examined a possible role forrumination in predicting depressive recurrence. Michalak et al. (2011)found that higher levels of rumination predicted shorter time to re-currence within 12 months after a mindfulness based treatment(Michalak et al., 2011 ). Scores on a cognitive reactivity measure(Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity; LEIDS ( Van der Does, 2002,2005 )) including the rumination subscale were also associated withtime to recurrence of depression ( Figueroa et al., 2015 ). In contrast,Timm et al. (2017) did not show a relationship between trait rumina-tion and time to recurrence, but found that rumination predicted levelsof residual symptoms at 6 and 30 months after treatment ( Timm et al.,2017 ).A key vulnerability that might underlie both depression and rumi-nation is de \ufb01cits in cognitive control or \ufb02exibility: cognitive \ufb02exibilityconcerns a set of processes including controlling and shifting attention,inhibiting irrelevant information, and updating working memory(Miyake et al., 2000 ). Attentional control, i.e. the ability to direct at-tention \ufb02exibly according to current goals, is considered to be one ofthe core abilities supporting and serving cognitive \ufb02exibility(Mackie et al., 2013 ). Experimental evidence from a range of tasks in-dicates that these impairments not only occur in clinically depressedgroups but also in vulnerable populations, including individuals withsubclinical symptoms and remitted groups ( Koster et al., 2017b; Snyder,2013 ).Empirical studies now indicate that rumination is also closely as-sociated with de\ufb01 cits in cognitive \ufb02exibility, particularly impairmentsin attentional inhibition and shifting ( De Lissnyder et al., 2011; Mor andDaches, 2015; Vanderhasselt et al., 2011; Whitmer and Banich, 2007 ).Several theoretical models have proposed that cognitive de \ufb01cits in-crease vulnerability to rumination, by reducing the ability to exertcontrol over these thought processes and impairing the use of otheremotional regulation strategies, such as reappraisal or distraction(Hirsch and Mathews, 2012; Koster et al., 2011; Mor and Daches, 2015;Watkins and Nolen-Hoeksema, 2014 ). For instance,Demeyer et al. (2012) showed that de\ufb01 cits on an attentional controltask were associated with depressive symptoms one year later and thisrelationship was mediated by rumination. Similarly, Hsu et al. (2015)showed that rumination mediated the relationship between self-re-ported attentional control and symptoms of depression/anxiety. How-ever, possible relationships between de \ufb01cits in cognitive \ufb02exibility,rumination and depressive recurrence have been less well examined.Most existing studies are limited by reliance on self-report measures ofcognitive \ufb02exibility and use of cross-sectional designs.In the current study we therefore consider the potential role of ru-mination and de\ufb01 cits in CC in predicting depressive recurrence, in agroup of patients remitted from at least 2 previous episodes of MDD. Toexamine cognitive \ufb02exibilitywe use two di \ufb00erent tasks: (1) IST(Internal Shift Task), which allows the examination of whether recur-rence is related to impairments in the capacity to shift between emo-tional or non-emotional information held in working memory(De Lissnyder et al., 2012b) and (2) ECT (Exogenous Cueing Task),which presents a \ufb01ne-grained measure of attentional bias, di \ufb00er-entiating between engagement and disengagement for emotional sti-muli and short and longer durations of presentation ( Koster et al.,2005 ). Examining the role of cognitive \ufb02exibility de\ufb01 cits and rumina-tion in depression is theoretically important in understanding vulner-ability to onset and recurrence of this disorder. These models also havepotential clinical utility; both cognitive \ufb02exibility de \ufb01cits and rumina-tion are possible targets for treatment and preventative interventions(Koster et al., 2017b; Martell et al., 2013; Mor and Daches, 2015; Siegleet al., 2014; Topper et al., 2017, 2010; Watkins et al., 2007).1.1. Aims and hypothesesThe aim of the current study was to examine performance on twocognitive \ufb02exibility tasks in a remitted patient group: \ufb01rstly, a versionof the exogenous cueing task (ECT), and secondly the Internal ShiftTask (IST). Further, we aimed to consider how cognitive \ufb02exibilityperformance related to both rumination and time to depressive recur-rence. Previous studies using the ECT have shown that clinically de-pressed participants show stronger attentional engagement with, andslower disengagement from, angry faces compared to healthy controls,respectively ( Leyman et al., 2007 ).Previous work using the IST has demonstrated that patients withMDD show general shifting impairments across emotional and neutralconditions, and rumination is associated with the degree of impairment(De Lissnyder et al., 2012c ). For both tasks, there is a lack of previousresearch in remitted depressed groups.We hypothesised that (1) Cognitive \ufb02exibility is poorer in the re-mitted patient group compared to controls; (2) Within the remittedpatient group, rumination is associated with di \ufb03culties in disengagingand shifting attention, particularly when processing negatively va-lenced emotional stimuli; (3) High rumination and cognitive \ufb02exibilityde\ufb01cits (di \ufb03culties in disengaging and shifting attention) are asso-ciated with shorter time to recurrence of depression, and (4)Rumination mediates the relationship between cognitive \ufb02exibilityde\ufb01cits and recurrence.2. Method2.1. ParticipantsParticipants were recruited in the context of the DELTA neuroima-ging study ( Mocking et al., 2016 ) from several psychiatric institutionsacross the Netherlands, via general practitioners, advertisements, pa-tient organizations, and previous research projects. The study was ap-proved by a local research ethics committee (ref: AMC-METC-Nr.:11/050). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Remitteddepressed (rMDD) patients had experienced \u22652 depressive episodesand were in stable remission for at least 8 weeks (according to theStructured Clinical Interview for DSM \u2010IV Axis I Disorders Patient Edi-tion[SCID \u2010I/P] and a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score [HDRS]\u22647). Patients were not using any psychotropic medication for >8weeks. Only controls without personal (SCID \u2010I/P) or \ufb01rst\u2010degree fa-milial psychiatric history were included. Exclusion criteria were: al-cohol/drug dependency; psychotic/bipolar disorder; primary anxietydisorder; personality disorder; electroconvulsive therapy within2 months of recruitment to the study; history of severe head trauma;neurological disease; severe general physical illness; no Dutch languagepro\ufb01ciency.2.2. Study design and procedureAt the baseline visit, we conducted the neuropsychological tests intwo blocks with a break in between, in the context of a larger assess-ment. After this baseline visit, all participants received a booklet in-cluding the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS \u2013see measures) to com-plete before the second visit (mean time from visit 1 to visit 2 was 39.8days [SD = 24.1]). To prospectively assess recurrence, we conductedfollow up assessments of rMDD participants every 4 months by phone.These assessments included administration of the SCID and HDRS. Thenumber of previous episodes was also assessed with the SCID-I. Tomaximize recurrence detection, we also instructed participants tocontact the study team at the moment they subjectively experienced arecurrence and to inform a person close to them of these instructions. Apublished protocol containing details of the full study is available(Mocking et al., 2016 ).C.A. Figueroa, et al. Journal of Affective Disorders 256 (2019) 364\u20133723652.3. Measures2.3.1. DepressionSeverity of depressive (residual) symptoms was assessed with theHDRS in both the rMDD and controls. Primary outcome for hypotheses3 and 4 was the time until occurrence of a major depressive episode(assessed by the SCID-I/P) in the 2.5-year follow-up period.2.3.2. Internal Shift Task (IST) ( De Lissnyder et al., 2012a ,c)The IST ( De Lissnyder et al., 2012a ,2012c ) is a working memorytask involving updating and shifting functions, executed on internallyrepresented stimuli. The task includes a gender and an emotion con-dition. These are completed sequentially, with order of conditionscounterbalanced across participants. For each condition, participantscompleted 3 practice blocks and 12 experimental blocks, with a randomnumber of 10 \u201314 trials per block. Each trial consists of presentation of asingle face in the centre of the screen. Participants were asked to keep amental count of the number of faces seen across two categories. In thegender condition, this equates to the number of male and female faces;in the emotion condition to the number of neutral and angry faces.Angry faces are speci \ufb01cally used due to the salience of social threat andinterpersonal evaluation in depression ( De Lissnyder et al., 2012c ). Aseach face is presented, participants are asked to press the space bar asquickly as possible when they have updated their internal counts (re-action time [RT] measure). The next stimulus is presented following aninter-stimulus interval of 200 ms. At the end of each block, participantsare asked to enter the number of faces seen from each category (ac-curacy measure).Blocks contain both switch and non-switch trials, i.e. trials in whichthe category to be updated is di \ufb00erent from or the same as the pre-ceding trial. The design of the task thus allows examination of switchingcosts under both emotional and non-emotional conditions. Switch costsare calculated as the di \ufb00erence in RT between switch and no-switchtrials (i.e. switch trial RT - non-switch trial RT) and provide an index ofthe e\ufb03ciency of shifting between representations in working memory.The IST was programmed using E-prime 2.0 and displayed on aWindows 7 desktops with a 60 Hz, 22-inch colour monitor. The facestimuli were extracted from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Facespicture set ( Lundqvist et al., 1998) and included 24 angry and 24neutral faces, selected on the basis of a previous validation study(Goeleven et al., 2008 ). Images were presented at a consistent size (326\u00d7 326 px) and adjusted to remove external features, e.g. hair.2.3.3. Exogenous cueing task (ECT)This task ( Fox et al., 2001; Koster et al., 2006), is based on theexogenous cueing paradigm ( Posner, 1980), and designed to investigateattentional e \ufb00ects when processing emotional stimuli. Emotional facialexpressions of four di \ufb00erent valences \u2013angry, sad, happy and neutral \u2013were used as cue stimuli. All face stimuli were extracted from theKarolinska Directed Emotional Faces picture set ( Lundqvist et al., 1998 )and adjusted to the same size (326 \u00d7 326 px). Sixteen pictures wereselected for each emotional category. Participants were asked to re-spond to the location of a visual target, presented to either the left orright of a central \ufb01xation point. This target was preceded by a visualcue, either in the same location as the target (valid cue) or in the op-posite location (invalid cue). Several key indices can be calculatedbased on the reaction times for di \ufb00erent cue types. Attentional en-gagement for each valence is calculated by comparing RTs for validlycued emotional trials to validly cued neutral trials (i.e. RT valid emo-tional trial \u2013RT valid neutral trial). Attentional disengagement for eachvalence is calculated by comparing RTs for invalidly cued emotionaltrials to invalidly cued neutral trials (i.e. RT invalid emotional trial \u2013RTinvalidneutral trial).The ECT was programmed using E-prime 2.0 and presented as de-scribed before the IST. Participants completed 10 practice trials and256 test trials. There were 16 test trials of each type (2 presentationdurations [200, 1000 ms], 2 conditions [valid, invalid cue], 4 facevalences). Order of trial types and target location was pseudo-rando-mised across the task (all subjects received the same randomized order).Each trial began with two white frames, presented at either side of a\ufb01xation cross for 500 ms. The cue stimulus was then presented in thelocation of one of these frames, for either 200 or 1000 ms, and followedby white mask presented for 50 ms. The target (black square) thenappeared in one of the frames and participants were asked to respond toits location as quickly as possible by pressing the left or right arrow keyon a standard keyboard. To minimise anticipatory responding, 12 \u2018catchtrials \u2019were included. These are trials in which a cue stimulus is pre-sented but not followed by a target. On these trials, participants wererequired to withhold responding.2.3.4. RRS-NLThe Dutch adaptation of the original RRS is a self-report ruminationmeasure ( Raes, 2012; Raes and Hermans, 2007; Raes et al., 2003 ,2009;Schoofs et al., 2010 ), which consists of 26 items that describe responsesto depressed mood focused on the self, symptoms, or consequences ofdepressed mood ( Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow, 1991 ). Items are ratedon a 4-point scale ( almost never toalmost always ) based on the extent towhich respondents engage in these thoughts or actions when feelingsad, down or depressed. Cronbach \u05f3s\u03b1for the total RRS-NL was 0.92 in avalidation study ( Schoofs et al., 2010) and 0.96 in the current study.The introductory statement was reframed so that, instead of askingparticipants what they generally do when depressed, the focus was ontheir responses in the past week.2.4. Statistical analysisAll analyses were conducted using SPSS v22. In order to compareperformance of patients and controls on each cognitive task, a mixedANOVA was conducted. For the IST, this included condition (emotion,gender) and switch type (switch, no switch) as within subject factors,and group (remitted patients, controls) as a between subject factor. Forthe ECT, the mixed ANOVA included valence (angry, sad, happy, neu-tral), cue duration (short, long), and cue validity (valid, invalid) aswithin subject factors and group (patients, controls) as a betweensubject factor. Relationships between task performance and ruminationwere examined in the remitted patient group only for the purpose of themediation analyses and to constrict the amount of tests. Two partici-pants with outlier scores, de \ufb01ned by more than 1.5 times the inter-quartile range from the quartiles ( Schwertman et al., 2004 ), (RRS total\u226570) were removed from these analyses. The remaining participantswere classi \ufb01ed as high or low ruminators using a median split (RRStotal\u2264or > 35) in line with previous studies ( Beckw\u00e9 et al., 2014;Koster et al., 2013). A mixed ANOVA was conducted for each task, asdescribed above, but with rumination group (high/low) as the between-subject factor. Main e \ufb00ects and interaction e \ufb00ects not involving groupare not reported in the text, as they are not relevant to the main studyhypotheses.2.5. Survival analysisCox proportional hazards regression models were used, with time to\ufb01rst recurrence as the endpoint. Participants lost to follow-up orwithout relapse during follow-up were considered censored. Based onprevious literature, we selected indices of IST (overall shift costs andemotion shift cost) and ECT (engagement and disengagement for eachduration and valence) task performance as possible predictors of re-currence. First, the associations of IST, ECT performance and rumina-tion (continuous score) with recurrence were investigated with simpleCox regression models. Besides the total score, we also examined thebrooding subscale as a predictor, as it has been suggested that broodingis a particularly maladaptive form of rumination { Nolen-Hoeksemaet al., 2008 #72}. One participant with outlier score on theC.A. Figueroa, et al. Journal of Affective Disorders 256 (2019) 364\u2013372366RRS (70) and one participant with outlier scores on the brooding sub-scale (15) was excluded from this analysis. To provide a measure ofe\ufb00ect for the analyses, we report the Hazard Ratio (HR) of one changein the Standard Deviation of predictors ( Azuero, 2016 ) in the text. Wereport the HR of the continuous score in the tables. Second, for vari-ables that were associated with time to \ufb01rst recurrence in this simplemodel, we conducted a further step-wise Cox regression model in whichwe adjusted for established predictors of depressive recurrence (re-sidual depressive symptoms and previous episodes of MDD).We planned to proceed with mediation analyses if assumptions formediation; rumination (mediator) must be related to cognitive \ufb02ex-ibility de\ufb01 cits and recurrence, were met in the simple and correctedmodels ( Baron and Kenny, 1986 ). We also examined if ruminationmodi\ufb01ed the relation between the ECT/IST scores and recurrence byadding a rumination interaction term in the Cox regression model. Wetested this model both with and without established predictors of re-currence (residual symptoms, previous episodes).3. Results3.1. ParticipantsThe full cohort included 73 remitted MDD-patients and 45 controls.Of these, 69 MDD-patients and 43 controls completed the neu-ropsychological test battery. Of the 69 MDD-patients, 64 (92.8%) had atleast 1 follow-up measurement and 52 (75.4%) completed 2.5 years offollow-up.The groups did not di \ufb00er signi \ufb01cantly on age, sex, IQ, education,living situation ( Table 1). However, remitted MDD-patients were sig-ni\ufb01cantly less often employed. HDRS scores and RRS scores were higherRRS-scores in MDD-patients than in controls. Di \ufb00erences betweengroups did not change when restricting the analyses to the participantsincluded in the IST and ECT analyses.3.2. ISTSixty-\ufb01ve rMDD patients and forty controls were included in the ISTanalyses. Six rMDD patients and two controls did not complete the IST;data from a further two rMDD patients and three controls were ex-cluded because the task stopped prematurely. A block was scored ascorrect if the reported number of faces was correct for both categories.Using this criterion, average accuracy was 73% ( M= 17.6 correct,SD = 4.71).3.2.1. Comparison between remitted patients and controlsAccuracy did not di \ufb00er by condition (gender/emotion) [ t(104)=\u22120.88, p= 0.281] or by group (rMDD/controls) [ t(103)=0.212,p= 0.832]. A mixed ANOVA showed a main e \ufb00ect of condition[F(1103)= 4.48, p= 0.037], with faster responses for gender trials[M= 1368.94 ms, SD = 428.09] than for emotion trials[M= 1454.56 ms, SD = 433.98]. There was also a main e \ufb00ect ofswitch type [ F(1103)= 271.83, p< 0.001], with faster responses on noswitch trials [ M= 1229.11 ms, SD = 367.68], than on switch trials[M= 1563.73 ms, SD = 444.13]. There was however no main e \ufb00ect ofgroup [ F(1103) =0.003, p= 0.954] and no signi \ufb01cant interaction e \ufb00ects[allp\u2019s >0.05].3.2.2. Relationships between rumination scores and IST performanceA mixed ANOVA analysis conducted only in the patients group,indicated signi \ufb01cant main e \ufb00ects of condition [ F(1,55) = 5.55,p= 0.022; faster responses for gender trials] and switch type[F(1,55) = 164.68, p< 0.001; faster responses on no switch trials], and asigni\ufb01cant interaction between switch type and rumination[F(1,55) = 5.62, p= 0.021; high ruminators were faster in non-switchtrials] ( seeFig. 1). This interaction was further explored by comparingshift costs between groups using independent samples t-tests.

ECTSixty-eight remitted MDD-patients and forty-three controls wereincluded in the ECT analysis. Four remitted MDD-patients and twocontrols did not complete the ECT; data from one remitted MDD-patientwas excluded because the task stopped prematurely. Trials with in-correct responses were excluded from analysis (0.4% of trials). Trialswere screened for very fast (<200 ms) or slow (>750 ms) responses,but no such trials were identi \ufb01ed. Seven participants made 1 catch-trialerror; the remaining participants made no such errors.3.3.1. Comparison between remitted patients and controlsThe mixed ANOVA analysis with reaction times as dependent out-come indicated no main e \ufb00ects of group and no signi \ufb01cant interactionsof stimulus-presentation*group, nor valence*group, nor stimulus-pre-sentation*valence*group [all p\u2019s >0.05] (Table S1).3.3.2. Relationships between rumination scores and ECT performanceWhen examining ECT performance of high and low ruminators,there was no main e \ufb00ect of group and no interactions with ruminationinvolving group [all p's>0.05]. These analyses therefore suggest noevidence of di \ufb00erences in ECT performance between participants withhigh and low rumination scores.3.4. IST/ECT performance and rumination as predictors for recurrenceBaseline characteristics of rMDD participants who experienced arecurrence during the study period, versus those who experienced norecurrence during the study period are shown in Table 2. Ruminationscores, ECT and IST indices for these groups are shown in Table 3.In the Cox regression models for the ECT performance measures,slower disengagement (i.e. RT invalid emotional trial \u2013RT invalidneutral trial) from angry faces, happy faces and sad faces presented at ashort duration was associated with a protective e \ufb00ect on recurrence ofdepression, (HRSD= 0.563 [CI, 0.381 \u20130.832]; Wald = 8.33; p= 0.004,HRSD= 0.561 [CI, 0.389 \u20130.808]; Wald = 9.61; p= 0.002; andHRSD= 0.657 [CI, 0.436 \u20130.990]; Wald = 4.03; p= 0.045, respec-tively). This means that, for one SD increase in disengagement scores(36.2 ms, 33.6 ms, 32.8 ms, respectively, the risk of recurrence within800 days was 0.56 times lower for angry and happy faces and 0.65times lower for sad faces. For angry and happy faces, these HRSD'scorrespond to medium e \ufb00ect sizes and for sad faces to a small tomedium e \ufb00ect size ( Azuero, 2016 ). For angry and happy faces, theseassociations remained signi \ufb01cant when correcting for residualsymptoms and previous depressive episodes (HR SD= 0.539 [CI,0.360 \u20130.805]; Wald = 9.11; p= 0.003; HR SD= 0.556 [CI,0.382 \u20130.809]; Wald = 9.38; p= 0.002). For sad faces however, thisassociation was no longer signi \ufb01cant after correcting for residualsymptoms and previous depressive episodes (HR SD= 0.687 [CI,0.879 \u20131.175]; Wald = 2.97; p= 0.085). Raw reaction times for re-sponding to invalidly cued angry, sad, happy and neutral face trialswere not associated with recurrence (all p's >0.05).For illustrative purposes we additionally compared patients withrapid disengagement for angry and happy faces to those with slowdisengagement (dichotomized by median scores; see Figs. 2 and 3).These analyses showed that participants with relatively fast disen-gagement from angry faces had a more than 2 fold, and from happyfaces almost 3 fold, increase in the risk of recurrence within 800 days,compared to participants with relatively slow disengagement fromangry faces (HRSD= 2.11 [Cl,1.003 \u20134.44], Wald=3.88; p= 0.049,HRSD= 2.96 [Cl = 1.41 \u20136.22]; Wald = 8.23; p= 0.004, respectively).Engagement with happy faces at short duration also predicted timeto recurrence (HR SD= 0.74 [CI, 0.558 \u20130.982]; Wald = 4.631;p= 0.037), but this was no longer signi \ufb01cant after correcting for re-sidual symptoms, and previous depressive episodes (HR SD= 0.81 [CI,0.595 \u20131.103]; Wald = 1.795; p= 0.18).Rumination was associated with recurrence in a simple Cox re-gression model (HR SD= 1.526 [CI, 1.152 \u20132.202]; Wald = 8.68;p= 0.003). This relationship remained signi \ufb01cant when correcting forresidual symptoms and previous depressive episodes (HR SD= 1.571[CI, 1.11 \u20132.22]; Wald=6.54; p= 0.011). The brooding ruminationsubscale was additionally associated with recurrence (HR SD= 1.50 [CI,1.103 \u20132.064]; Wald=6.63; p= 0.010), and after correcting for residualsymptoms and previous depressive episodes (HR SD= 1.55 [CI,1.075 \u20132.245]; Wald=5.51; p= 0.019). Further, rumination (total andbrooding) was not associated with the ECT predictors examined (all p's>0.05). Because the assumptions were not met, mediation analyseswere not conducted. Continuous HR's from the Cox regression analysesfor the ECT and IST variables are shown in Table 3.Rumination*disengagement interaction terms were added to thetwo signi \ufb01cant regression models (disengagement from angry andhappy faces when presented at short durations). In neither of thesemodels the interaction term was signi \ufb01cant p= 0.390 and p= 0.898respectively.4. DiscussionThis study investigated associations between cognitive \ufb02exibilityand rumination in patients whose depression had remitted, and testedwhether these factors predicted time to depressive recurrence.

Figueroa, et al. Journal of Affective Disorders 256 (2019) 364\u2013372368between high and low ruminators, except that general switch costs onthe IST were larger for high ruminators. More rapid disengagementfrom emotional (angry and happy) faces (200 ms presentation), relativeto neutral faces, was associated with shorter time to recurrence over a2.5-year follow up. In contrast to our hypotheses, this relationship wasnot mediated by rumination. Rumination, and its brooding subscale,was a predictor of recurrence.It has previously been demonstrated that both depressed patientsand vulnerable groups show impaired attentional disengagement, par-ticularly for negative information ( Gotlib and Joormann, 2010 ).Therefore, we hypothesised that remitted depressed patients wouldhave di \ufb03culties disengaging, which in turn would be mediated by ru-mination and predict depressive recurrence. In this study, we \ufb01nd nodi\ufb00erences in cognitive \ufb02exibility, measured by the IST and ECT task,when comparing remitted-MDD and controls, nor do we \ufb01nd strongrelationships with rumination, which is in contrast to previous theo-retical models ( Demeyer et al., 2012; Koster et al., 2017b; Snyder,2013 ). Importantly, we conducted a supplementary power analysis andshowed that with 90% power, we were able detect small to mediume\ufb00ects (Supplementary Results) making it likely that our study does notmiss large (clinically important) e \ufb00ects due to low power.With respect to prediction of recurrence, our \ufb01nding was in theopposite direction to that hypothesised \u2013that is, participants who mostrapidly disengaged from emotional faces had a higher risk of depressiverecurrence, with a medium e \ufb00ect size. Patients with a relatively fastdisengagement from angry faces had a more than 2 fold, and fromhappy faces almost 3 fold, increase in the risk of recurrence within 800days. The predictive e \ufb00ect was not due to di \ufb00erences in raw reactiontimes, but speci \ufb01cally to di \ufb00erences in reaction time between emotionaland neutral faces. Furthermore, rumination, the total score andbrooding subscale, predicted recurrence. However, it was not related tomore rapid disengagement and therefore did not mediate the relation-ship between disengagement and recurrence, which we had hypothe-sized. Supplementary analyses indicated that we had substantial power,of 90%, to detect a medium e \ufb00ect size for our survival analyses.However, we had very low power (25%) to detect a small e \ufb00ect(Supplementary Results).Although we had hypothesised that di \ufb03culty disengaging withTable 3rMDD patients recurrent versus resilient during follow-up IST/ECT and rumination.Cox statisticsEXP (B) Wald 95 CI pExogenous Cueing Task Recurrent ( n= 34) Resilient ( n= 29)Disengage sad short mean(SEM) \u22120.67 (5.98) 7.21(4.42) 0.984 4.03 0.975 \u20131.000 0.045Disengage angry short mean(SEM) \u22126,81 (5.25) 9.31(4.94) 0.984 8.33 0.974 \u20130.995 0.004Disengage happy short mean(SEM) \u221210.94(6.45) 6.45(4.13) 0.983 9.61 0.972 \u20130.994 0.002Disengage sad long mean(SEM) \u22126.79 (6.72) \u22121.94 (3.72) 0.995 0.69 0.985 \u20131.006 0.41Disengage angry long mean(SEM) \u22121.93(6.49) \u22122.93 (6.01) 1.001 0.02 0.991 \u20131.010 0.89Disengage happy long mean(SEM) \u221216.8(4.77) \u221211.35(4.55) 0.995 0.29 0.985 \u20131.006 0.59Engage sad short mean(SEM) \u22123.75 (\u22123.76) 3.33 (5.33) 0.996 0.59 0.984 \u20131.007 0.44Engage angry short mean(SEM) \u221214.5(5.38) \u22124.77 (6.09) 0.996 0.66 0.986 \u20131.006 0.42Engage happy short mean(SEM) \u221222.3(6.88) \u22123.91 (5.84) 0.991 4.36 0.983 \u20130.999 0.037Engage sad long mean(SEM) 7.05(6.46) 20.7(5.14) 0.989 3.81 0.977- 1.000 0.051Engage angry long mean(SEM) \u22123.3(6.03) 4.60(5.64) 0.994 1.08 0.98 \u20131.010 0.299Engage happy long mean(SEM) 8.9(5.07) 20.11(5.67) 0.994 1.36 0.983 \u20131.004 0.237Internal Shift Task (IST) Recurrent ( n= 34) Resilient ( n= 27)Global Shift cost mean(SEM) 314.9 (39.4) 331.7 (34.2) 1.000 0.003 0.998 \u20131.002 0.95Emotional shift cost mean(SEM) 330.2 (45.1) 341.5 (28.6) 1.000 0.001 0.999 \u20131.001 0.97Rumination Recurrent ( n= 34) Resilient ( n= 26)RRS total score mean(SEM) 41.0(2.1) 32.9(1.8) 1.038 8.69 1.012 \u20131.063 0.003RRS Brooding subscale mean(SEM) 7.88(0.5) 9.71(0.57) 1.15 6.63 1.033 \u20131.271 0.010Abbreviations: EXP: exponential; CI: con \ufb01dence interval; RRS: Ruminative Response Scale SEM: Standard Error of Mean; WALD: Wald statistic.Fig. 2.

Journal of Affective Disorders 256 (2019) 364\u2013372369emotional faces would predict recurrence, it is notable that other stu-dies have shown links between speeded disengagement and a \ufb00ectivedisorders. For instance, Yiend et al. (2015) found evidence in two stu-dies that patients with generalised anxiety disorder show speeded dis-engagement from negative faces. Here, caution is warranted in extra-polating \ufb01ndings across populations. Rapid disengagement fromemotional faces might be related to decreased a \ufb00ective \ufb02exibility: theability to \ufb02exibly attend to and disengage from emotional and nonemotional situations or stimuli ( Malooly et al., 2013). A \ufb00ective \ufb02ex-ibility is considered a crucial aspect of emotional resilience and mightbe related to better emotion regulation (ER), in particular reappraisal todown-regulate sad a \ufb00ect (Malooly et al., 2013).Early life stress might result in divergent cognitive styles, associatedwith avoidance or increased attention towards negative/threateningstimuli ( Del Giudice et al., 2011; England-Mason et al., 2018 ). In con-trast to the vigilant style, an avoidant cognitive style might be morelikely in the presence of poor ER ( England-Mason et al., 2018 ). In linewith this model, rapid disengagement from emotional facial cues isconsistent with an avoidant response style. A review and meta-analysisfound that MDD patients self-report more frequent use of higher ma-ladaptive emotion regulation strategies, including avoidance and ru-mination, which persists in remitted MDD and might lead to a higherrisk for recurrence ( Visted et al., 2018 ). Consistent with this, we \ufb01ndthat remitted patients who show a general emotional avoidance haveshorter time to recurrence. Taken together, our \ufb01ndings of increasedavoidance indicate that these patients have di \ufb03culty in regulatingemotional stimuli, resulting in an avoidant response style and an in-creased risk for recurrence. Further research is needed to explore thisissue using systematic studies of the relationship between attentionalmeasures, ER and recurrence vulnerability.Interestingly, only attentional disengagement from stimuli pre-sented for short intervals (200 ms) as opposed to longer intervals(1000 ms) was associated with time to recurrence. Previous studies inacute depression have typically demonstrated that attentional biasesexist at longer presentations, suggesting that these biases occur more atthe elaborative (instead of automatic) stages of information processing(Gotlib and Joormann, 2010). We note that at longer stimulus pre-sentations on the ECT, our pattern of results is indicative of an Inhibi-tion of Return e \ufb00ect (Klein, 2000) (i.e. valid cues inhibit rather thanfacilitate responding to the target). Therefore, responding to theselonger presentations is likely to re \ufb02ect the operation of di \ufb00erent at-tentional processes. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that it may be that attentionalresponses di \ufb00er during remission compared to the acute phase of de-pression.5. Clinical implicationsIf replicated, attentional disengagement from emotional stimuli maybe an important marker for clinical and research purposes of increasedrisk of recurrence within remitted populations. Furthermore, increasedavoidance of emotional stimuli may also be amenable to change viacognitive interventions. Speci \ufb01cally, approaches that focus on enhan-cing cognitive control by activating frontal brain areas implicated inattentional control might be particularly bene \ufb01cialin decreasingavoidance, emotional vulnerability and rumination, and increasing re-silience in subjects at risk for depression ( Koster et al., 2017a;Swainston and Derakshan, 2018). Such approaches are likely to beclinically important, given the high recurrence rates in MDD and theneed to develop more e \ufb00ective treatments that address this5.1. Strengths and limitationsStrengths of the current study include the use of a drug-free clinicalsample phenotyped with objective measures of cognitive \ufb02exibility and2.5 years follow up of participants, with repeated assessments to de-termine timing of recurrence. Relatively few studies have used long-itudinal designs to assess the role of cognitive and psychological riskfactors for recurrence in this way. The use of a matched comparisongroup of controls facilitates interpretation of the results.Our\ufb01ndings require replication, especially given concerns about thereliability of attentional tasks that rely on RT measurement, and evi-dence that outcomes on these tasks are highly sensitive to minorchanges in task methodology (e.g. stimulus timing and intensity) ( Cisleret al., 2009; Parsons et al., 2018 ). Further, while excluding participantscurrently taking psychotropic medication and/or with comorbid psy-chiatric disorder leads to a well-de \ufb01ned sample and precludes con-founding by medication e \ufb00ects, this might have reduced general-izability of the current \ufb01ndings to a broader clinical population withrecurrent depression. Additionally, relationships between ruminationand attentional control were explored using a measure of self-reporttrait rumination. Future research should additionally look at actualchanges in rumination during attentional tasks, for example after arumination induction procedure. For both the group di \ufb00erences in theattentional tasks and the survival analyses we were able to detectFig. 3.

However, we might have misseddi\ufb00erences with small e \ufb00ect sizes due to insu \ufb03cient power ( Supple-mentary Results ).6. ConclusionsUsing the IST and ECT tasks of cognitive control, we found noevidence of impaired cognitive \ufb02exibility in patients in stable remissionfrom MDD compared to controls. Rapid disengagement from angry andhappy emotional faces was a signi \ufb01cant predictor of a shorter time torecurrence, even after correcting for other known predictors. These\ufb01ndings are novel, as very few studies have examined whether per-formance on cognitive \ufb02exibility tasks is associated with depressiverecurrence. Attentional disengagement from emotional stimuli may bean interesting target to establish who is at increased risk of recurrence,and may be amenable to change via cognitive interventions.Declaration of Competing interestNone.AcknowledgementsThis study is supported by unrestricted personal grants from theAcademic Medical Centre to C.A.
