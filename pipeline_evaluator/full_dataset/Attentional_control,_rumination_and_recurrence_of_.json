Whilst some clinical predictors of recurrence have been clearly demonstrated (e.g. residual symptoms,\nRecurrence\n\nprevious episodes), the cognitive and psychological processes that may contribute to recurrence risk are less well\nestablished. In this study we examine whether cognitive flexibility deficits and rumination are related to re-\ncurrence in a remitted clinical sample.\n\nMethod: We compared remitted patients with 2 or more previous depressive episodes (N = 69) to a matched\ngroup of healthy controls (N = 43). Cognitive flexibility was measured using the Internal Shift Task (IST) and a\nversion of the Exogenous Cueing Task (ECT); rumination was assessed with the Ruminative Responses Scale.\nResults: 1ST and ECT performance did not differ between remitted patients and controls. Remitted patients had\nhigher levels of rumination than controls. Within the remitted patient group, faster disengagement from angry\nand happy faces on the ECT was predictive of shorter time to recurrence (hazard ratio for 1 standard deviation,\n(HRgp) = 0.563 [CI, 0.381-0.832], p = 0.004, (HRgp) = 0.561 [CI, 0.389-0.808], p = 0.002, respectively).\nRumination predicted recurrence (HRgp, = 1.526 [CI, 1.152-2.202]; p = 0.003) but was not related to emotional\ndisengagement.\n\nLimitations: We had low power to detect small effects for the analysis within remitted patients.\n\nConclusions: Whilst cognitive flexibility in remitted patients was not impaired relative to controls, rapid dis-\nengagement from emotional stimuli and rumination were independently associated with time to recurrence.\nCognitive flexibility may be an important indicator of recurrence risk, and a target for interventions to reduce\nrecurrence.\n\nCognitive control\nAttentional control\nRumination\n\nRepetitive negative thinking\n\n1.

An important factor that adds to\nthe large burden of MDD is the high risk of recurrence after remission\nfrom a depressive episode. MDD recurrence rates are typically reported\nto be above 50% (Eaton et al., 2008; Hardeveld et al., 2013; Steinert\net al., 2014), with rates as high as 90% within 10-15 years in clinical\nsamples with 3 or more previous episodes (Beshai et al., 2011; Bockting\net al,, 2015).

High levels of rumination have been con-\nsistently shown to predict the onset, severity and maintenance of de-\npressive episodes (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008; Watkins, 2008).

Figueroa, et al\n\nconsidered a risk factor for recurrence of depression (Watkins, 2009). A\nsmall number of studies have specifically examined a possible role for\nrumination in predicting depressive recurrence. Michalak et al. (2011)\nfound that higher levels of rumination predicted shorter time to re-\ncurrence within 12 months after a mindfulness based treatment\n(Michalak et al, 2011). Scores on a cognitive reactivity measure\n(Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity; LEIDS (Van der Does, 2002,\n2005)) including the rumination subscale were also associated with\ntime to recurrence of depression (Figueroa et al., 2015). In contrast,\nTimm et al. (2017) did not show a relationship between trait rumina-\ntion and time to recurrence, but found that rumination predicted levels\nof residual symptoms at 6 and 30 months after treatment (Timm et al.,\n2017).\n\nA key vulnerability that might underlie both depression and rumi-\nnation is deficits in cognitive control or flexibility: cognitive flexibility\nconcerns a set of processes including controlling and shifting attention,\ninhibiting irrelevant information, and updating working memory\n(Miyake et al., 2000). Attentional control, i.e. the ability to direct at-\ntention flexibly according to current goals, is considered to be one of\nthe core abilities supporting and serving cognitive flexibility\n(Mackie et al., 2013). Experimental evidence from a range of tasks in-\ndicates that these impairments not only occur in clinically depressed\ngroups but also in vulnerable populations, including individuals with\nsubclinical symptoms and remitted groups (Koster et al., 2017b; Snyder,\n2013).\n\nEmpirical studies now indicate that rumination is also closely as-\nsociated with deficits in cognitive flexibility, particularly impairments\nin attentional inhibition and shifting (De Lissnyder et al., 2011; Mor and\nDaches, 2015; Vanderhasselt et al., 2011; Whitmer and Banich, 2007).\nSeveral theoretical models have proposed that cognitive deficits in-\ncrease vulnerability to rumination, by reducing the ability to exert\ncontrol over these thought processes and impairing the use of other\nemotional regulation strategies, such as reappraisal or distraction\n(Hirsch and Mathews, 2012; Koster et al., 2011; Mor and Daches, 2015;\nWatkins ~~ and Nolen-Hoeksema, ~~ 2014). For instance,\nDemeyer et al. (2012) showed that deficits on an attentional control\ntask were associated with depressive symptoms one year later and this\nrelationship was mediated by rumination. Similarly, Hsu et al. (2015)\nshowed that rumination mediated the relationship between self-re-\nported attentional control and symptoms of depression/anxiety. How-\never, possible relationships between deficits in cognitive flexibility,\nrumination and depressive recurrence have been less well examined.\nMost existing studies are limited by reliance on self-report measures of\ncognitive flexibility and use of cross-sectional designs.\n\nIn the current study we therefore consider the potential role of ru-\nmination and deficits in CC in predicting depressive recurrence, in a\ngroup of patients remitted from at least 2 previous episodes of MDD. To\nexamine cognitive flexibility we use two different tasks: (1) IST\n(Internal Shift Task), which allows the examination of whether recur-\nrence is related to impairments in the capacity to shift between emo-\ntional or non-emotional information held in working memory\n(De Lissnyder et al, 2012b) and (2) ECT (Exogenous Cueing Task),\nwhich presents a fine-grained measure of attentional bias, differ-\nentiating between engagement and disengagement for emotional sti-\nmuli and short and longer durations of presentation (Koster et al.,\n2005). Examining the role of cognitive flexibility deficits and rumina-\ntion in depression is theoretically important in understanding vulner-\nability to onset and recurrence of this disorder. These models also have\npotential clinical utility; both cognitive flexibility deficits and rumina-\ntion are possible targets for treatment and preventative interventions\n(Koster et al., 2017b; Martell et al., 2013; Mor and Daches, 2015; Siegle\net al, 2014; Topper et al., 2017, 2010; Watkins et al., 2007).\n\n1.1. Aims and hypotheses\n\n\u2018The aim of the current study was to examine performance on two\n\n365\n\nJournal of Affective Disorders 256 (2019) 364-372\n\ncognitive flexibility tasks in a remitted patient group: firstly, a version\nof the exogenous cueing task (ECT), and secondly the Internal Shift\nTask (IST). Further, we aimed to consider how cognitive flexibility\nperformance related to both rumination and time to depressive recur-\nrence. Previous studies using the ECT have shown that clinically de-\npressed participants show stronger attentional engagement with, and\nslower disengagement from, angry faces compared to healthy controls,\nrespectively (Leyman et al., 2007).\n\nPrevious work using the IST has demonstrated that patients with\nMDD show general shifting impairments across emotional and neutral\nconditions, and rumination is associated with the degree of impairment\n(De Lissnyder et al., 2012c). For both tasks, there is a lack of previous\nresearch in remitted depressed groups.\n\nWe hypothesised that (1) Cognitive flexibility is poorer in the re-\nmitted patient group compared to controls; (2) Within the remitted\npatient group, rumination is associated with difficulties in disengaging\nand shifting attention, particularly when processing negatively va-\nlenced emotional stimuli; (3) High rumination and cognitive flexibility\ndeficits (difficulties in disengaging and shifting attention) are asso-\nciated with shorter time to recurrence of depression, and (4)\nRumination mediates the relationship between cognitive flexibility\ndeficits and recurrence.\n\n2. Method\n2.1. Participants\n\nParticipants were recruited in the context of the DELTA neuroima-\nging study (Mocking et al., 2016) from several psychiatric institutions\nacross the Netherlands, via general practitioners, advertisements, pa-\ntient organizations, and previous research projects. The study was ap-\nproved by a local research ethics committee (ref: AMC-METC-Nr.:11/\n050). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Remitted\ndepressed (rMDD) patients had experienced =2 depressive episodes\nand were in stable remission for at least 8 weeks (according to the\nStructured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders Patient Edi-\ntion [SCID-I/P] and a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score [HDRS]\n<7). Patients were not using any psychotropic medication for >8\nweeks. Only controls without personal (SCID-I/P) or first-degree fa-\nmilial psychiatric history were included. Exclusion criteria were: al-\ncohol/drug dependency; psychotic/bipolar disorder; primary anxiety\ndisorder; personality disorder; electroconvulsive therapy within\n2months of recruitment to the study; history of severe head trauma;\nneurological disease; severe general physical illness; no Dutch language\nproficiency.\n\n2.2. Study design and procedure\n\nAt the baseline visit, we conducted the neuropsychological tests in\ntwo blocks with a break in between, in the context of a larger assess-\nment. After this baseline visit, all participants received a booklet in-\ncluding the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS \u2014 see measures) to com-\nplete before the second visit (mean time from visit 1 to visit 2 was 39.8\ndays [SD = 24.1]). To prospectively assess recurrence, we conducted\nfollow up assessments of rMDD participants every 4 months by phone.\nThese assessments included administration of the SCID and HDRS. The\nnumber of previous episodes was also assessed with the SCID-L To\nmaximize recurrence detection, we also instructed participants to\ncontact the study team at the moment they subjectively experienced a\nrecurrence and to inform a person close to them of these instructions. A\npublished protocol containing details of the full study is available\n(Mocking et al., 2016).\n\n\nCA. Figueroa, et al\n2.3. Measures\n\n2.3.1. Depression\n\nSeverity of depressive (residual) symptoms was assessed with the\nHDRS in both the rMDD and controls. Primary outcome for hypotheses\n3 and 4 was the time until occurrence of a major depressive episode\n(assessed by the SCID-I/P) in the 2.5-year follow-up period.\n\n2.3.2. Internal Shift Task (IST) (De Lissnyder et al., 2012a,c)\n\nThe IST (De Lissnyder et al., 2012a, 2012\u00a2) is a working memory\ntask involving updating and shifting functions, executed on internally\nrepresented stimuli. The task includes a gender and an emotion con-\ndition. These are completed sequentially, with order of conditions\ncounterbalanced across participants. For each condition, participants\ncompleted 3 practice blocks and 12 experimental blocks, with a random\nnumber of 10-14 trials per block. Each trial consists of presentation of a\nsingle face in the centre of the screen. Participants were asked to keep a\nmental count of the number of faces seen across two categories. In the\ngender condition, this equates to the number of male and female faces;\nin the emotion condition to the number of neutral and angry faces.\nAngry faces are specifically used due to the salience of social threat and\ninterpersonal evaluation in depression (De Lissnyder et al., 2012c). As\neach face is presented, participants are asked to press the space bar as\nquickly as possible when they have updated their internal counts (re-\naction time [RT] measure). The next stimulus is presented following an\ninter-stimulus interval of 200 ms. At the end of each block, participants\nare asked to enter the number of faces seen from each category (ac-\ncuracy measure).\n\nBlocks contain both switch and non-switch trials, i.e. trials in which\nthe category to be updated is different from or the same as the pre-\nceding trial. The design of the task thus allows examination of switching\ncosts under both emotional and non-emotional conditions. Switch costs\nare calculated as the difference in RT between switch and no-switch\ntrials (i.e. switch trial RT - non-switch trial RT) and provide an index of\nthe efficiency of shifting between representations in working memory.\n\nThe IST was programmed using E-prime 2.0 and displayed on a\n\u2018Windows 7 desktops with a 60 Hz, 22-inch colour monitor. The face\nstimuli were extracted from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces\npicture set (Lundquist et al., 1998) and included 24 angry and 24\nneutral faces, selected on the basis of a previous validation study\n(Goeleven et al., 2008). Images were presented at a consistent size (326\nx 326 px) and adjusted to remove external features, e.g. hair.\n\n2.3.3. Exogenous cueing task (ECT)\n\nThis task (Fox et al., 2001; Koster et al., 2006), is based on the\nexogenous cueing paradigm (Posner, 1980), and designed to investigate\nattentional effects when processing emotional stimuli. Emotional facial\nexpressions of four different valences \u2014 angry, sad, happy and neutral ~\nwere used as cue stimuli. All face stimuli were extracted from the\nKarolinska Directed Emotional Faces picture set (Lundqvist et al., 1998)\nand adjusted to the same size (326 x 326 px). Sixteen pictures were\nselected for each emotional category. Participants were asked to re-\nspond to the location of a visual target, presented to either the left or\nright of a central fixation point. This target was preceded by a visual\ncue, either in the same location as the target (valid cue) or in the op-\nposite location (invalid cue). Several key indices can be calculated\nbased on the reaction times for different cue types. Attentional en-\ngagement for each valence is calculated by comparing RTs for validly\ncued emotional trials to validly cued neutral trials (i.e. RT valid emo-\ntional trial - RT valid neutral trial). Attentional disengagement for each\nvalence is calculated by comparing RTs for invalidly cued emotional\ntrials to invalidly cued neutral trials (i.e. RT invalid emotional trial - RT\ninvalid neutral trial).\n\nThe ECT was programmed using E-prime 2.0 and presented as de-\nscribed before the IST. Participants completed 10 practice trials and\n256 test trials. There were 16 test trials of each type (2 presentation\n\n366\n\nJournal of Affective Disorders 256 (2019) 364-372\n\ndurations [200, 1000 ms], 2 conditions [valid, invalid cue], 4 face\nvalence). Order of trial types and target location was pseudo-rando-\nmised across the task (all subjects received the same randomized order).\nEach trial began with two white frames, presented at either side of a\nfixation cross for 500 ms. The cue stimulus was then presented in the\nlocation of one of these frames, for either 200 or 1000 ms, and followed\nby white mask presented for 50 ms. The target (black square) then\nappeared in one of the frames and participants were asked to respond to\nits location as quickly as possible by pressing the left or right arrow key\non a standard keyboard. To minimise anticipatory responding, 12 \u2018catch\ntrials\u2019 were included. These are trials in which a cue stimulus is pre-\nsented but not followed by a target. On these trials, participants were\nrequired to withhold responding.\n\n2.3.4. RRS-NL\n\n\u2018The Dutch adaptation of the original RRS is a self-report rumination\nmeasure (Raes, 2012; Raes and Hermans, 2007; Raes et al., 2003, 2009;\nSchoofs et al., 2010), which consists of 26 items that describe responses\nto depressed mood focused on the self, symptoms, or consequences of\ndepressed mood (Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow, 1991). Items are rated\non a 4-point scale (almost never to almost always) based on the extent to\nwhich respondents engage in these thoughts or actions when feeling\nsad, down or depressed. Cronbach's a for the total RRS-NL was 0.92 in a\nvalidation study (Schoofs et al., 2010) and 0.96 in the current study.\nThe introductory statement was reframed so that, instead of asking\nparticipants what they generally do when depressed, the focus was on\ntheir responses in the past week.\n\n2.4. Statistical analysis\n\nAll analyses were conducted using SPSS v22. In order to compare\nperformance of patients and controls on each cognitive task, a mixed\nANOVA was conducted. For the IST, this included condition (emotion,\ngender) and switch type (switch, no switch) as within subject factors,\nand group (remitted patients, controls) as a between subject factor. For\nthe ECT, the mixed ANOVA included valence (angry, sad, happy, neu-\ntral), cue duration (short, long), and cue validity (valid, invalid) as\nwithin subject factors and group (patients, controls) as a between\nsubject factor. Relationships between task performance and rumination\nwere examined in the remitted patient group only for the purpose of the\nmediation analyses and to constrict the amount of tests. Two partici-\npants with outlier scores, defined by more than 1.5 times the inter-\nquartile range from the quartiles (Schwertman et al., 2004), (RRS total\n>70) were removed from these analyses. The remaining participants\nwere classified as high or low ruminators using a median split (RRS\ntotal < or > 35) in line with previous studies (Beckw\u00e9 et al., 2014;\nKoster et al, 2013). A mixed ANOVA was conducted for each task, as\ndescribed above, but with rumination group (high/low) as the between-\nsubject factor. Main effects and interaction effects not involving group\nare not reported in the text, as they are not relevant to the main study\nhypotheses.\n\n2.5. Survival analysis\n\nCox proportional hazards regression models were used, with time to\nfirst recurrence as the endpoint. Participants lost to follow-up or\nwithout relapse during follow-up were considered censored. Based on\nprevious literature, we selected indices of IST (overall shift costs and\nemotion shift cost) and ECT (engagement and disengagement for each\nduration and valence) task performance as possible predictors of re-\ncurrence. First, the associations of IST, ECT performance and rumina-\ntion (continuous score) with recurrence were investigated with simple\nCox regression models. Besides the total score, we also examined the\nbrooding subscale as a predictor, as it has been suggested that brooding\nis a particularly maladaptive form of rumination {Nolen-\nHoeksema et al., 2008 #72}. One participant with outlier score on the\n\n\nCA. Figueroa, et al\n\nRRS (70) and one participant with outlier scores on the brooding sub-\nscale (15) was excluded from this analysis. To provide a measure of\neffect for the analyses, we report the Hazard Ratio (HR) of one change\nin the Standard Deviation of predictors (Azuero, 2016) in the text. We\nreport the HR of the continuous score in the tables. Second, for vari-\nables that were associated with time to first recurrence in this simple\n\u2018model, we conducted a further step-wise Cox regression model in which\nwe adjusted for established predictors of depressive recurrence (re-\nsidual depressive symptoms and previous episodes of MDD).\n\nWe planned to proceed with mediation analyses if assumptions for\n\u2018mediation; rumination (mediator) must be related to cognitive flex-\nibility deficits and recurrence, were met in the simple and corrected\nmodels (Baron and Kenny, 1986). We also examined if rumination\n\u2018modified the relation between the ECT/IST scores and recurrence by\nadding a rumination interaction term in the Cox regression model. We\ntested this model both with and without established predictors of re-\ncurrence (residual symptoms, previous episodes).\n\n3. Results\n3.1. Participants\n\nThe full cohort included 73 remitted MDD-patients and 45 controls.\nOf these, 69 MDD-patients and 43 controls completed the neu-\nropsychological test battery. Of the 69 MDD-patients, 64 (92.8%) had at\nleast 1 follow-up measurement and 52 (75.4%) completed 2.5 years of\nfollow-up.\n\n\u2018The groups did not differ significantly on age, sex, IQ, education,\nliving situation (Table 1). However, remitted MDD-patients were sig-\nnificantly less often employed. HDRS scores and RRS scores were higher\nRRS-scores in MDD-patients than in controls. Differences between\ngroups did not change when restricting the analyses to the participants\nincluded in the IST and ECT analyses.\n\n3.2. IST\n\nSixty-five rMDD patients and forty controls were included in the IST\nanalyses. Six tMDD patients and two controls did not complete the IST;\ndata from a further two rMDD patients and three controls were ex-\ncluded because the task stopped prematurely. A block was scored as\ncorrect if the reported number of faces was correct for both categories.\nUsing this criterion, average accuracy was 73% (M = 17.6 correct,\nSD = 4.71).\n\nTable 1\nRemitted recurrent MDD patients versus controls at baseline.\n\nJournal of Affective Disorders 256 (2019) 364-372\n\n1600\n1550\n1500\n1450\n1400\n\n1350\n\nReaction time (ms)\n\nla\n\n1300\n1250\n\n1200\nNon switch trials Switch trials\n\nTrial type\n\nLow ruminators ~~ High ruminators\n\nFig. 1.

ECT\n\nSixty-eight remitted MDD-patients and forty-three controls were\nincluded in the ECT analysis. Four remitted MDD-patients and two\ncontrols did not complete the ECT; data from one remitted MDD-patient\nwas excluded because the task stopped prematurely. Trials with in-\ncorrect responses were excluded from analysis (0.4% of trials). Trials\nwere screened for very fast (<200 ms) or slow (>750 ms) responses,\nbut no such trials were identified. Seven participants made 1 catch-trial\nerror; the remaining participants made no such errors.\n\n3.3.1. Comparison between remitted patients and controls\nThe mixed ANOVA analysis with reaction times as dependent out-\ncome indicated no main effects of group and no significant interactions\nof stimulus-presentation*group, nor valence*group, nor stimulus-pre-\nsentation*valence*group [all p's >0.05] (Table S1).\n\n3.3.2. Relationships between rumination scores and ECT performance\n\nWhen examining ECT performance of high and low ruminators,\nthere was no main effect of group and no interactions with rumination\ninvolving group [all p's>0.05]. These analyses therefore suggest no\nevidence of differences in ECT performance between participants with\nhigh and low rumination scores.\n\n3.4. IST/ECT performance and rumination as predictors for recurrence\n\nBaseline characteristics of rMDD participants who experienced a\nrecurrence during the study period, versus those who experienced no\nrecurrence during the study period are shown in Table 2. Rumination\nscores, ECT and IST indices for these groups are shown in Table 3.\n\nIn the Cox regression models for the ECT performance measures,\nslower disengagement (i.e. RT invalid emotional trial ~ RT invalid\nneutral trial) from angry faces, happy faces and sad faces presented at a\nshort duration was associated with a protective effect on recurrence of\n\ndepression, (HRs = 0.563 [CI, 0.381-0.832]; Wald = 8.33; p = 0.004,\nHRgp = 0.561 [CI, 0.389-0.808]; Wald =9.61; p=0.002 and\nHRsp = 0.657 [CI 0.436-0.990]; Wald = 4.03; p = 0.045, respec-\n\ntively). This means that, for one SD increase in disengagement scores\n(36.2 ms, 33.6 ms, 32.8 ms, respectively, the risk of recurrence within\n800 days was 0.56 times lower for angry and happy faces and 0.65\ntimes lower for sad faces. For angry and happy faces, these HRSD's\ncorrespond to medium effect sizes and for sad faces to a small to\nmedium effect size (Azuero, 2016). For angry and happy faces, these\nassociations remained significant when correcting for residual\n\nTable 2\n\nJournal of Affective Disorders 256 (2019) 364-372\n\nsymptoms and previous depressive episodes (HRgp = 0.539 [CI\n0.360-0.805]; Wald = 9.11; p=0.003; HRs, =0.556 [CI\n0.382-0.809]; Wald = 9.38; 0.002). For sad faces however, this\nassociation was no longer significant after correcting for residual\nsymptoms and previous depressive episodes (HRgp = 0.687 [CI\n0.879-1.175]; Wald = 2.97; p = 0.085). Raw reaction times for re-\nsponding to invalidly cued angry, sad, happy and neutral face trials\nwere not associated with recurrence (all p's >0.05).\n\nFor illustrative purposes we additionally compared patients with\nrapid disengagement for angry and happy faces to those with slow\ndisengagement (dichotomized by median scores; see Figs. 2 and 3).\nThese analyses showed that participants with relatively fast disen-\ngagement from angry faces had a more than 2 fold, and from happy\nfaces almost 3 fold, increase in the risk of recurrence within 800 days,\ncompared to participants with relatively slow disengagement from\nangry faces (HRsp = 2.11 [Cl,1.003-4.44], Wald=3.88; p = 0.049,\nHRgp = 2.96 [Cl = 1.41-6.22]; Wald = 8.23; p = 0.004, respectively).\n\nEngagement with happy faces at short duration also predicted time\nto recurrence (HRsp=0.74 [CI 0.558-0.982]; Wald = 4.631;\nPp = 0.037), but this was no longer significant after correcting for re-\nsidual symptoms, and previous depressive episodes (HRsp = 0.81 [CI,\n0.595-1.103]; Wald = 1.795; p = 0.18).\n\nRumination was associated with recurrence in a simple Cox re-\ngression model (HRgp = 1.526 [CI, 1.152-2.202]; Wald = 8.68;\nPp = 0.003). This relationship remained significant when correcting for\nresidual symptoms and previous depressive episodes (HRs = 1.571\n[CI, 1.11-2.22]; Wald=6.54; p = 0.011). The brooding rumination\nsubscale was additionally associated with recurrence (HRgp = 1.50 [CI,\n1.103-2.064]; Wald =6.63; p = 0.010), and after correcting for residual\nsymptoms and previous depressive episodes (HRsp = 1.55 [CI\n1.075-2.245]; Wald =5.51; p = 0.019). Further, rumination (total and\nbrooding) was not associated with the ECT predictors examined (all p's\n>0.05). Because the assumptions were not met, mediation analyses\n\u2018were not conducted. Continuous HR's from the Cox regression analyses\nfor the ECT and IST variables are shown in Table 3.\n\nRumination*disengagement interaction terms were added to the\ntwo significant regression models (disengagement from angry and\nhappy faces when presented at short durations). In neither of these\n\u2018models the interaction term was significant p = 0.390 and p = 0.898\nrespectively.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis study investigated associations between cognitive flexibility\nand rumination in patients whose depression had remitted, and tested\nwhether these factors predicted time to depressive recurrence.

More rapid disengagement\nfrom emotional (angry and happy) faces (200 ms presentation), relative\nto neutral faces, was associated with shorter time to recurrence over a\n2.5-year follow up. In contrast to our hypotheses, this relationship was\nnot mediated by rumination. Rumination, and its brooding subscale,\nwas a predictor of recurrence.\n\nIt has previously been demonstrated that both depressed patients\nand vulnerable groups show impaired attentional disengagement, par-\nticularly for negative information (Gotlib and Joormann, 2010).\nTherefore, we hypothesised that remitted depressed patients would\nhave difficulties disengaging, which in turn would be mediated by ru-\nmination and predict depressive recurrence. In this study, we find no\ndifferences in cognitive flexibility, measured by the IST and ECT task,\nwhen comparing remitted-MDD and controls, nor do we find strong\nrelationships with rumination, which is in contrast to previous theo-\nretical models (Demeyer et al, 2012; Koster et al., 2017b; Snyder,\n2013). Importantly, we conducted a supplementary power analysis and\nshowed that with 90% power, we were able detect small to medium\n\n800.00,\n\neffects (Supplementary Results) making it likely that our study does not\nmiss large (clinically important) effects due to low power.\n\nWith respect to prediction of recurrence, our finding was in the\nopposite direction to that hypothesised - that is, participants who most\nrapidly disengaged from emotional faces had a higher risk of depressive\nrecurrence, with a medium effect size. Patients with a relatively fast\ndisengagement from angry faces had a more than 2 fold, and from\nhappy faces almost 3 fold, increase in the risk of recurrence within 800\ndays. The predictive effect was not due to differences in raw reaction\ntimes, but specifically to differences in reaction time between emotional\nand neutral faces. Furthermore, rumination, the total score and\nbrooding subscale, predicted recurrence. However, it was not related to\nmore rapid disengagement and therefore did not mediate the relation-\nship between disengagement and recurrence, which we had hypothe-\nsized. Supplementary analyses indicated that we had substantial power,\nof 90%, to detect a medium effect size for our survival analyses.\nHowever, we had very low power (25%) to detect a small effect\n(Supplementary Results).\n\nAlthough we had hypothesised that difficulty disengaging with\n\n369\n\n\nCA.

For instance, Yiend et al. (2015) found evidence in two stu-\ndies that patients with generalised anxiety disorder show speeded dis-\nengagement from negative faces. Here, caution is warranted in extra-\npolating findings across populations. Rapid disengagement from\nemotional faces might be related to decreased affective flexibility: the\nability to flexibly attend to and disengage from emotional and non\nemotional situations or stimuli (Malooly et al., 2013). Affective flex-\nibility is considered a crucial aspect of emotional resilience and might\nbe related to better emotion regulation (ER), in particular reappraisal to\ndown-regulate sad affect (Malooly et al., 2013).\n\nEarly life stress might result in divergent cognitive styles, associated\nwith avoidance or increased attention towards negative/threatening\nstimuli (Del Giudice et al, 2011; England-Mason et al., 2018). In con-\ntrast to the vigilant style, an avoidant cognitive style might be more\nlikely in the presence of poor ER (England-Mason et al., 2018). In line\nwith this model, rapid disengagement from emotional facial cues is\nconsistent with an avoidant response style. A review and meta-analysis\nfound that MDD patients self-report more frequent use of higher ma-\nladaptive emotion regulation strategies, including avoidance and ru-\nmination, which persists in remitted MDD and might lead to a higher\nrisk for recurrence (Visted et al., 2018). Consistent with this, we find\nthat remitted patients who show a general emotional avoidance have\nshorter time to recurrence. Taken together, our findings of increased\navoidance indicate that these patients have difficulty in regulating\nemotional stimuli, resulting in an avoidant response style and an in-\ncreased risk for recurrence. Further research is needed to explore this\nissue using systematic studies of the relationship between attentional\nmeasures, ER and recurrence vulnerability.\n\nInterestingly, only attentional disengagement from stimuli pre-\nsented for short intervals (200ms) as opposed to longer intervals\n(1000 ms) was associated with time to recurrence. Previous studies in\nacute depression have typically demonstrated that attentional biases\nexist at longer presentations, suggesting that these biases occur more at\nthe elaborative (instead of automatic) stages of information processing\n(Gotlib and Joormann, 2010). We note that at longer stimulus pre-\nsentations on the ECT, our pattern of results is indicative of an Inhibi-\ntion of Return effect (Klein, 2000) (i.e. valid cues inhibit rather than\nfacilitate responding to the target). Therefore, responding to these\nlonger presentations is likely to reflect the operation of different at-\ntentional processes. Our findings suggest that it may be that attentional\n\n370\n\n800.00\n\nresponses differ during remission compared to the acute phase of de-\npression.\n\n5. Clinical implications\n\nIf replicated, attentional disengagement from emotional stimuli may\nbe an important marker for clinical and research purposes of increased\nrisk of recurrence within remitted populations. Furthermore, increased\navoidance of emotional stimuli may also be amenable to change via\ncognitive interventions. Specifically, approaches that focus on enhan-\ncing cognitive control by activating frontal brain areas implicated in\nattentional control might be particularly beneficial in decreasing\navoidance, emotional vulnerability and rumination, and increasing re-\nsilience in subjects at risk for depression (Koster et al, 2017;\nSwainston and Derakshan, 2018). Such approaches are likely to be\nclinically important, given the high recurrence rates in MDD and the\nneed to develop more effective treatments that address this\n\n5.1. Strengths and limitations\n\nStrengths of the current study include the use of a drug-free clinical\nsample phenotyped with objective measures of cognitive flexibility and\n2.5 years follow up of participants, with repeated assessments to de-\ntermine timing of recurrence. Relatively few studies have used long-\ntudinal designs to assess the role of cognitive and psychological risk\nfactors for recurrence in this way. The use of a matched comparison\ngroup of controls facilitates interpretation of the results.\n\nOur findings require replication, especially given concerns about the\nreliability of attentional tasks that rely on RT measurement, and evi-\ndence that outcomes on these tasks are highly sensitive to minor\nchanges in task methodology (e.g. stimulus timing and intensity) (Cisler\net al., 2009; Parsons et al., 2018). Further, while excluding participants\ncurrently taking psychotropic medication and/or with comorbid psy-\nchiatric disorder leads to a well-defined sample and precludes con-\nfounding by medication effects, this might have reduced general\nizability of the current findings to a broader clinical population with\nrecurrent depression. Additionally, relationships between rumination\nand attentional control were explored using a measure of self-report\ntrait rumination. Future research should additionally look at actual\nchanges in rumination during attentional tasks, for example after a\nrumination induction procedure. For both the group differences in the\nattentional tasks and the survival analyses we were able to detect\n\n\nCA. Figueroa, et al.\n\n\u2018medium effect sizes with 90% power. However, we might have missed\ndifferences with small effect sizes due to insufficient power (Supple-\nmentary Results).\n\nConclusions\n\nUsing the IST and ECT tasks of cognitive control, we found no\nevidence of impaired cognitive flexibility in patients in stable remission\nfrom MDD compared to controls. Rapid disengagement from angry and\nhappy emotional faces was a significant predictor of a shorter time to\nrecurrence, even after correcting for other known predictors. These\nfindings are novel, as very few studies have examined whether per-\nformance on cognitive flexibility tasks is associated with depressive\nrecurrence. Attentional disengagement from emotional stimuli may be\nan interesting target to establish who is at increased risk of recurrence,\nand may be amenable to change via cognitive interventions.\n\nDeclaration of Competing interest\n\nNone.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n\u2018This study is supported by unrestricted personal grants from the\nAcademic Medical Centre to C.A.
