In total,three out of seven studies found impairments of individual measures of executive functioning with varying effect sizes(see Table 3). While one of these studies(Klimkeit et al., 2011) reported a large effect size for poorer results on a set-shifting task in MDD cases compared to controls,two others showed either medium(Smith et al., 2006) or small (Baune et al., 2012) effect sizes for worse performance o nEF measures(Trail Making Test B; Wisconsin Card SortingTest)in the depressed groups compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, two other single measures of EF (Brixton spatial anticipation testand Stroop Colour-Word test)employed in the study by Smith et al. (2006) showed no differences between depressed andcontrol groups, suggesting that EF deficits in depressed individuals in their study were specific to measures on the Trail Making Test B. In contrast,four out of the seven studies found no significant difference in measures of EF(McClure etal., 1997; Korhonen et al., 2002; Kyteetal., 2005; Matthewsetal., 2008). All of these four studies used different single tests for EF and the study by Matthewsetal. (2008) investigated females only which might have contributed to the heterogeneous negative results.In total of the seven studies,only two studies used the same measure of EF, namely the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test(WCST), however,with ‘totalerrors’ and ‘categoriescompleted’ of the WCST as single measures of EF as compared to the negative study by Kyteetal. (2005), that emphasised on attentional flexibility by using the ‘Intra-Dimensional, Extra-DimensionalSet-Shiftingtask ’ derived from theWCST.These results again suggest that results on the cognitive domain of EF across studies largely depend on the use of the individual tests. Since verbal fluency is frequently regarded as a measure of EF, the results reported here show two studies explicitly examining this domain as part of EF. It was found that participants with minor depression compared to controls had deficits inverbal fluency showing a large effect size, whereas MDD patients remained unaffected in the same study(Klimkeit et al., 2011). In a second study on verbal fluency studied as part of EF and investigating a similar age group between 12 and 17 years of age showed a contrasting result as the controlled oral word association test and the test of clinical evaluation of language functions (CELF)showed no impairments in verbal fluency in the depressed group compared to controls(McClure et al., 1997)."

Additionally, two studies reported impaired psychomotor processing speed in depressed participants compared to controls, with differing effect sizes depending on subdomains. Large effect sizes were found for tests of psychomotor skills (slower movement times) (Matthews et al., 2008) and motor speed (slower movement preparation and execution times) (Klimkeit et al., 2011). Furthermore, in the study by Klimkeit et al. (2011), medium effect sizes were found for differences between depressed and control groups on a task of cognitive speed (inspection and reaction times). This study (Klimkeit et al., 2011) has used separate measures for cognitive speed and motor speed, whereas the study by Matthews et al. (2008) employed a combined measure of psychomotor speed."

In contrast, findings regarding the extent of impairments on\nneuropsychological tasks in samples of younger adults (21-38\nyears) with mild to moderate depression have been controversial\nSuggesting a lack of such deficits in younger adults (Grant et al.,\n2001; Wang et al.,, 2006; Casteneda et al, 2008). However, limited\ndata has been published in the even younger age groups such as\nadolescence and early adulthood.\n\nAlthough the most consistently reported findings of neuropsy-\nchological impairments across age groups from younger adults to\nelderly include executive functioning (Purcell et al, 1997; Fossati\netal, 1999; Grant et al., 2001; Harvey et al, 2004; Hill et al, 2004;\nStordal et al., 2004; Smith and Muir, 2006; Taylor Tavares et al.,\n2007; Gohier et al, 2009), adult studies provide evidence to\nsuggest that depression is associated with global cognitive deficits\naffecting various neuropsychological domains (Gualtieri et al,\n2006).\n\nIn contrast, there is a paucity of research about the potential\nimpact of depression on neuropsychological functioning in people\nduring early adulthood and adolescence exposed to depression.\nThis is important to note the consequences of early-onset depres-\nsion are often more severe, far-reaching and show more frequent\ndepressive episodes, possibly causing long-term social and mental\ndisability as compared to later onset of depression in adulthood\n(Klein et al, 1999; Parker et al, 2003; Gollan et al, 2005a). In\naddition, research has shown that the psychological, social, phy-\nsical and biological alterations occurring during adolescence are\nsignificant risk factors for the development of depression in young.\nage groups, with a clear increase in prevalence from age 13 years\nonwards (Abela and Hakin, 2008; Lack and Green, 2009). Despite\nthe prevalence of depression in adolescents and young adults\nbeing estimated similar to adults with 5.3% for a 12-month episode\nand 13.2% for a lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD) (Hasin\net al, 2005), depressed young people are more likely to experience\nrecurrent episodes of depression with increased likelihood of\nsuicide, achieve lower educational attainment, and have a higher\nchance of unemployment and an increased risk of co-morbidities\nin adulthood (Berndt et al., 2000; Parker et al., 2003; Gollan et al.,\n2005b; Calles, 2007), which taken together, potentially result in\nsevere long-term psychosocial impairment (Weissman et al., 1999;\nDunn and Goodyer, 2006). Given this significant long-term impact\nof depression at early onset on various outcomes, it is important to\nbetter understand the nature of neuropsychological function and\ndysfunction in this younger age group.\n\nFurthermore, since adult studies suggest a possible relevant\nfunctional relationship between neuropsychological function,\nemployment status (Baune et al, 2010) and general function\n(Airaksinen et al., 2006; Jaeger et al., 2006) in depression, a better\nclinical description of neuropsychological function and dysfunc-\ntion in young people with depression would be an important step\nforward to understand poor outcomes and help identify targets for\nintervention in depression. Moreover, whether adolescents and\nyoung adults are also prone to global cognitive deficits or are\nbetter characterised by domain-specific cognitive disturbance\nremains unclear, although some first evidence suggests domain-\nspecific deficits such as in executive and working memory func-\ntioning (Baune et al., 2012) and executive functioning in younger\ndepressed individuals with early onset of depression (Castaneda\net al, 2008). Furthermore, studies in adults suggest that cognitive\nfunction may be present in a first episode of MDD (indicative of an\nearly sign of MDD) (Lee et al, 2012) and may still be impaired at\nleast in some domains of cognitive function during remission of\ndepression (Hammar and Ardal, 2009) and importantly, that\ncognitive dysfunction may have a role as a prognostic marker of\ndepression (Reppermund et al, 2009). These clinical observations\n\non both cause and effects of cognitive dysfunction in depression\nare highly important for clinical prevention and are unknown in\nthe younger age groups. The identification and treatment of\ncognitive deficits in depression may help both in improving\nclinical outcomes and possibly in identifying early signs of dete-\nrioration of mood states.\n\nSince these clinical observations demonstrate a need to focus on\nneuropsychological function in younger age groups, namely ado-\nlescents and early adults, it is necessary to frame the review in a\ncontext of normative and disruptive brain developmental. The\neffects of depression in neuropsychological function may depend\non the following briefly described important principles of brain\ndevelopment. First, while the developmental trajectory of grey\nmatter (GM) volume follows an inverted U-shape, white matter\n(WM) volume increases steadily throughout childhood and adoles-\ncence and is likely to reflect improved connectivity and integration\nof disparate neural circuits (Giedd et al, 1999; Lee et al, 2012) and\npossibly influencing cognitive abilities (Tamnes et al, 2010). With\nvarious brain regions undergoing different patterns of maturation,\nneural consequences of stress-related conditions such as depression\ndepend on the developmental stage at which the stress and\ndepression occurred (Reppermund et al, 2009). Therefore, stress\nand stress-related depression may have a greater impact on\ncognitive and emotional function in childhood and adolescence as\nthe brain experiences critical changes compared to adulthood.\n\nSecond, since it has been reported that higher-order association\ncortices develop only after lower-order sensorimotor cortices have\nmatured in structure and function with the frontal lobe structures\n(e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)) involved in executive\nfunctioning, attention, motor coordination as well as heteromodal\nassociation regions the last areas to develop, it has been suggested\nthat complex functions in higher-order structures are more\nsusceptible to the effects of stress-related conditions including\ndepression due to protracted earlier periods of postnatal develop-\nment (Hammar and Ardal, 2009). Third, genetic and gender\ninfluences jointly contribute to individual differences in brain\ndevelopment. Based on these principles of normative brain devel-\nopment, it can be hypothesised that a pathological brain condition\nsuch as depression and related stressful experiences impact on\nneuropsychological function specifically in younger age groups\nduring development.\n\nIn summary, given (a) the reported functional implications of\nneuropsychological deficits in depression, (b) the proposed differ-\nences in neuropsychological deficits between young age groups,\nolder adulthood and the elderly, (c) the likely impact of depression\non neuropsychological function during adolescence and younger\nadulthood, and (d) the above mentioned neurobiological norma-\ntive developmental processes relevant to adolescence and young\nadulthood (e.g. brain maturation and PFC development), this\nreview focuses on studies in this particular age group.\n\nIn this review we evaluate a range of cognitive domains of\nneuropsychological function as published in the original studies.\nThese include the domains of executive functioning, verbal learn-\ning and memory, working memory, visual memory, attention and\npsychomotor speed. The method and the results sections will\ndefine the domains and list the individual cognitive test under\neach domain for review. In summary, the aim of this review is to\ncharacterise a variety of domains of neuropsychological function in\ndepression among individuals between adolescence and young\nadulthood (12-25 years of age).\n\n2. Methods\n\nA literature search was performed using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and\nPsycINFO databases covering publications from 1995 to 2014. The following\n\n\nB.T. Baune et al. / Psychiatry Research 218 (2014) 261-271 263\n\nkeywords were used to search for articles: youth OR adolescence AND major\ndepressive disorder OR depression OR depressive OR depre” OR early onset\ndepression AND cognitive function OR neuropsychological AND impairment OR\ndeficit. The literature search was limited to English language and human studies.\nAdditional articles were obtained by reviewing reference lists of research articles.\nResearch articles conducting neuropsychological/neuropsychological assessment\nbetween adolescence and adults with unipolar depression were considered for\ninclusion in the review. Initially, a total of 194 studies were retrieved using these\ninitial search terms. The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to\nthis pool of initial hits ~ inclusion criteria: (1) age groups between 12 and 25 years;\n(2) case-control study; (3) primary diagnosis of depression; (4) lifetime diagnosis of\ndepression; (5) current and/or previous episodes (including euthymic mood states)\nof depression; Exclusion criteria: (1) the study focus was on medical disorders (e:\ndiabetes type 1); or (2) other psychiatric disorders as primary diagnosis (e:\nbipolar disorder, schizophrenia); (3) depression was regarded as co-morbidity\nrather than as primary diagnosis of unipolar depression and (4) developmental\ndisorders were present. In addition, studies primarily investigating participants\nwith (5) psychotic depression or cognitive decline were excluded from this review.\nThese criteria excluded also studies on participants with a simultaneous inclusion\nof an age range below and above 25 yrs of age (e.g. 17-70 years of age). Hence, the\napplied inclusion | exclusion criteria led to an age homogenous study base of\nparticipants between 12 and 25 years of age making comparisons between studies\nhighly valid and not compounded by the simultaneous inclusion of older or\nyounger groups. The inclusion and exclusion process of primary studies was\nperformed independently by two reviewers (MF, BTB). Disagreements on inclu-\nsionjexclusion of studies were resolved by consensus. Finally, a total of seven\narticles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and remained eligible for this\nreview.\n\n‘The retrieved studies investigated various cognitive domains and a large variety of\nindividual neuropsychological tests was used across studies. The underlying theore-\ntical construct of a neuropsychological domain was not consistently provided in each\nstudy. As an overview, Table 1 lists the cognitive domains and related individual\nneuropsychological tests as used in the original studies. This review presents the\nresults based on neuropsychological constructs and individual tests of cognitive\ndomains as reported in the original studies. The review focuses on executive function,\nverbal fluency, working memory, verbal learning and memory, visual (-spatial)\nmemory, attention and psychomotor and processing speed as these domains have\nbeen reported to show impairments in adults with depression (Beblo et al 2011; Rock\netal, 2013). While we reported the individual tests and associated cognitive domains\nas shown in the original studies (see Table 3), we re-ordered individual tests under the\nmost appropriate cognitive domain, which might have been different from the original\nstudy. Details of the alignment of individual tests and cognitive domains for the\npurpose of this review are shown in Table 1\n\nTable 1\n\nIn order to place the observed differences in neuropsychological function\nbetween case and control groups across studies into a more meaningful context,\neffect sizes were included when reported in the original studies or calculation of\neffect sizes based on means and standard deviations or t values and df. were\ncarried out for the purpose of this review.

Results\n\nFor the purpose of this review, seven studies examining\nneuropsychological functions in adolescents and young adults\nbetween 12 and 25 years of age were identified fulfilling the\ninclusion and exclusion criteria, The selected studies employed\ncase-control designs with generally small total sample sizes\nranging from 97 of the largest study to the smallest with 28\nparticipants. Two of the studies investigated female participants\nonly (McClure et al, 1997; Matthews et al, 2008).

The results section presents the literature according to\ncognitive domains and individual test as used in the original\nstudies (see Table 1).

Cognitive domain-specific results\n\n3.1.1. Executive function\n\nExecutive function (EF) is a neuropsychological construct to\ndescribe the regulation of cognitive processes including a variety\nof cognitive abilities such as working memory, flexibility, problem\nsolving, planning, execution and reasoning (Chan et al, 2008). A\nlarge variety of individual tests as shown in Table 1 has been\ndeveloped and is commonly used to measure EF.

The types of memory investigated in studies on neu-\nropsychological performance in adolescents and young adults\nincluded in this review include working memory, verbal learning\nand memory, and visual (-spatial) memory. The processing of verbal\nand visual (-spatial) stimuli within the working memory can be\nregarded as part of the storage process.\n\n3.1.2.1. Working memory. Working memory (WM) is a model of\nactive maintenance of information in the short-term storage\nformulated by Baddeley and Hitch that consists of three basic\nstores: the central executive, the phonological loop and the visuo-\nsketchpad (Baddeley, 2000).\n\nconsistently, regarded as part of executive function. For the\n\n31.22. Verbal learning and memory. Verbal learning (VL) is\ntypically associated with the memorisation and retention of lists\nof words, in order to describe basic elements of associative\nlearning. Verbal learning tends to involve more than just the\nmemorisation of words since many stimuli such as pictures,\nodours, locations, etc. can be studied. During verbal learning\nand memory tasks, the types of mental events that occur in\nverbal learning studies go beyond passive memorisation, as\nlearners can play a very active role in manipulating experimental\nstimuli.\n\n‘The domain of verbal learning and memory was investigated in\ndifferences between depressed and control groups. Two of these\nnegative studies employed the California Verbal Learning Test\n(CVLT) (McClure et al., 1997; Smith et al, 2006), which allows a\ndirect comparison of study results, whereas the third other study\nused the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RVLT) (Baune et al.,\n2012).\n\n31.23, Visual (spatial) memory. Visual memory (VM) describes\nthe relationship between perceptual processing and the storage\nand retrieval of the resulting neural representations. Those\nmemories of visual images (eg. dinner plates) are stored in\nwhat is called visual memory.\n\nSelective Reminding Tests (McClure et al, 1997). Interestingly,\nMDD patients showed poorer performance with a large effect size\nfor a measure of visual spatial perception (Judgement of line\norientation test - JOL), which is regarded as a cognitive ability that\nmay influence visual memory performance (McClure et al, 1997).\n\n3.1.3. Attention\n\nAttention (A) is a cognitive process of selectively concentrating\non one aspect while ignoring other aspects of the environment\nand belongs to a commonly studied cognitive domain in depres-\nsion research. In the domain of attention, impairments of selective\nattention, divided attention, and vigilance have been reported in\ndepression (Beblo et al, 2011). However, it is still a matter of\ndebate whether depressed patients show cognitive slowing.\nChristensen et al. (1997) conclude from their meta-analysis that\ndepressed adult patients show impaired performance on timed\ntasks, but it remains unclear whether this impairment is due to a\nslowing of cognitive processing or, alternatively, has to be\nregarded as a consequence of the increased rumination that is\nregularly reported among patients with depression.\n\n3.14. Psychomotor and processing speed\n\nPsychomotor processing speed (PPS) is based on the measure of\nreaction time to a task that measures time elapsed between the\npresentation of a sensory stimulus and the subsequent beha-\nvioural response. Typical measures of processing speed are simple\nreaction time, recognition, choice reaction time (CRT), Digit Symbol\nSubstitution Test, discrimination reaction time, Trail Making Test A. In\nthe studies included in this review, the domain of psychomotor\nand processing speed was measured by using a variety of tests\nincluding individual tests in the areas of both cognitive speed and\n\n\nEl\ng\ng\n5\nH\n3\n2\n7\nH\n=\n&\nz\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis review of neuropsychological performance in depressed\n\ndomains. Most convincingly, three out of four studies investigating\nWM and three out of four studies investigating PPS found\n\nlearning and memory, however, this domain has a small study\nbase of three original investigations only.\nAlthough neuropsychological impairments have often been\n\nThe results of our review show large similarities with studies\non neuropsychological performance in adults with depression on\n\nB.T. Baune et al. / Psychiatry Research 218 (2014) 261-271\n\nseveral of the affected cognitive domains in both age groups. A\nrecent meta-analysis revealed significant moderate cognitive def-\nicits in executive function, memory and attention in adult patients\nwith current or remitted depression relative to controls (Cohen's d\neffect sizes ranging from —034 to —0.65) based on studies\nemploying the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated\nBattery (CANTAB) (Rock et al., 2013). Interestingly, the effect sizes\nof deficits in these domains reported in our review tended be\nsomewhat higher (range > 0.8) than in the meta-analysis by Rock\net al. (2013) (ranging from —0.34 to —0.65). Even across different\nlarge neuropsychological test batteries, the domains of attention,\nexecutive function, and memory have been reported to be pri-\nmarily affected in adult depression (Beblo and Lautenbacher,\n2006). Overall, the moderate to large effect sizes as reported in\nour review, indirectly corroborate previous postulates suggesting\nthat the severity and the profile of cognitive deficiencies in\ndepression is clinically relevant and comparable to those seen in\nmoderately severe traumatic brain injury (Veil, 1997).\n\nThe finding in our review about impaired psychomotor and\nprocessing speed is worth discussing further. Two out of four\nstudies found slower psychomotor processing speed and reaction\ntime in adolescents and young adults with depression compared to\ncontrols (Matthews et al,, 2008; Klimkeit et al, 2011). The study by\nKlimkeit et al. (2011) reported both statistically significant cogni-\ntive speed (inspection time, reaction time) and motor speed\n(movement preparation time) deficits, whereas the study by\nMatthews et al. (2008) employed a measure that combined both\nreaction time and movement times, suggesting that the underlying\nconstructs for motor and cognitive speed are similar across both\nstudies. Moreover, two other studies reported different results in\nthe PPS domain. The cross-sectional study by Korhonen et al. found\nno impairment on motor speed in 16 treatment seeking adoles-\ncents (aged 16 to 20 years) measured by using Stroop Colour-Word\ntest and Trail Making Tests B (Korhonen et al, 2002); unfortunately,\nthe authors did not specify in their report how motor speed was\nmeasured specifically using those tests. In contrast, Kyte et al.\nreported that recently depressed adolescents (first episode) were\nfaster (rather than slower) to make their decision on a decision-\nmaking task (p < 0.02) (Kyte et al. 2005). According to the authors,\nthis latter finding was probably associated with increased impul-\nsivity, and less specific to psychomotor speed. However, when\nevaluating psychomotor speed, a clear distinction between tasks\nmeasuring motor speed and cognitive processing speed is impor-\ntant since motor speed appears to be a function that may reach\nmaturity by early adolescence (Huttenlocher and Dabholkar, 1997),\nwhereas cognitive processing speed and reaction time are mea-\nsures that continue to progress through adolescence (Anderson\net al, 2001; Leon-Carrion et al, 2004; Luna et al, 2004; Luciana\net al, 2005). These findings might also be related to elevated\nglucocorticoid levels associated with chronic stress in depression,\nas correlations have been found between improvement of informa-\ntion processing speed and a reduction in cortisol levels (Zobel et al,\n2004; Reppermund et al, 2007), however, none of the studies\nincluded in this review have published cortisol levels.\n\nIn this review we decided to include a response inhibition\n(using an affective Go, No-Go task) as a measure of attention that\nshowed no deficits in this domain. Although this single study\nresult is preliminary, this may suggest that the domain of attention\nis less typically affected in adolescents and young adults as\ncompared to adults and elderly studies (Beblo and Lautenbacher,\n2006; Klimkeit et al, 2011).\n\nIt has previously been suggested that higher severity (see meta-\nanalysis by McDermott and Ebmeier, 2009), recurrent episodes\n(Andersson et al., 2010) and remission status (Baune et al, 2010;\nBhardwaj et al,, 2010; Rock et al,, 2013) in depression in adults are\nrelated to more severe impairment of neuropsychological function\n\n\nB.T. Baune et al. / Psychiatry Research 218 (2014) 261-271 269\n\nas compared to healthy controls. Although the study base in\nadolescents and young adults as reported in our review is small,\nfirst observations have been made to suggest that a first episode of\ndepression is associated with poorer function in executive function,\nmotor speed, cognitive speed and working memory (Klimkeit et al,\n2011). In contrast, a study in first episode depression reported no\ndifferences between cases and healthy controls in executive func-\ntioning, attentional flexibility and behavioural inhibition tasks (Kyte\net al., 2005). However, the differences between the Klimkeit et al.\n(2011) and Kyte et al. (2005) studies might be due to measuring\ndepressive symptoms related to the first depressive episode at\ndifferent time-points: while the study with positive results tested\ndepressive symptoms at the time of the first episode of depression\n(Klimkeit et al, 2011), the negative study included participants with\na first episode in the past year; hence, several of the participants\nmost likely were not severely depressed at the time of testing as\nindicated by data from the depression measure at study commence-\nment (Kyte et al., 2005). However, when strict criteria for euthymic\nmood states of MDD at study commencement were applied, our\nreview reported from a single study that 42 euthymic MDD patients\nshowed poorer performance on Trail Making Test A and Trail\nMaking Test B of large to moderate effect sizes (d=101 and\nd=0.76, respectively). Since no other studies with young (12-25\nyears of age) MDD participants of euthymic mood states have been\npublished so far, further research into the important question\nwhether neuropsychological impairment is a state, trait or both in\ndepression is required.\n\nMoreover, the diagnostic classification of mood disorder is of\nparticular importance for evaluating neuropsychological deficits in\nmood disorders of young adults and adolescents. The literature in\nolder adults suggests that Bipolar Disorder (BD) is associated with\nlarger neuropsychological deficits as compared to MDD (Burt et al.,\n2000), although other studies suggest at least similar levels of\nimpairments for both MDD and BD disorder patients (Taylor\nTavares et al, 2007). In our review, we identified a single study\nthat compared neuropsychological deficits in MDD to bipolar\nspectrum disorder (BSD) and reported that BSD patients per-\nformed worse on tasks for verbal memory (short delay recall,\np=0.009 and recognition hits, p=0.02) and on Trail Making Test B\n(p=0.03) (Smith et al, 2006). Further research is needed in the\nadolescent and young adult groups to explore the characteristics\nand possible differences between MDD and BD in this age group.\n\nAdditional clinical factors such as comorbidity may influence\nthe reported results, although this area is still controversial\n(Castaneda et al, 2010). For example, the comorbidity status\n(e.g. ADHD) in depressed adolescents and young adults may have\nsignificant impact on cognitive function potentially causing a\nsubstantial bias in the results of the neuropsychological evaluation\nin this age group (Favre et al, 2009; Klimkeit et al, 2011).\nAlthough several of the primary studies assessed such comorbid-\nity, their consideration in the analyses is limited in the reviewed\nstudies and need consistent consideration in future studies.\nSimilarly, this requirement applies to medical comorbidities as it\nhas been shown that chronic medical conditions such as diabetes\ntype I with comorbid depression, are associated with neuropsy-\nchological impairment (Sinnamon et al. 2013). In general, since\nclinical factors such as comorbidities have previously been shown\nto impact on cognitive function in adult depression (Beblo et al,\n2011), careful consideration of these factors is warranted in future\nstudies on cognitive function in depression in younger age groups.\n\n5. Limitations and strengths\n\nThe presented review has strengths and limitations. Due to the\nage inclusion criteria of 12-25 years of age, a number of studies in\n\nadults and in children were excluded. This approach left the\nreview with a small study base of seven original studies in\nadolescents and young adults (12-25 years of age). The interpreta-\ntion of the presented results needs to consider this small study\nbase and caution is warranted. However, since numerous reviews\nand meta-analyses have already been undertaken on neuropsy-\nchological function in depression in adults, we aimed at the\nadolescent and young adult age group for this review. Accordingly,\nwe excluded studies that spanned across both adult and adoles-\ncence age groups in the same study in order to be able to make an\nage-specific comparison of studies in the chosen age bracket of\n12-25 years. This focus, albeit limited, may also be seen as\nadvantageous in the context of the international clinical focus on\nunderstanding and tracing the early development of mental ill-\nness, its early detection and intervention as well as prevention in\nadolescents and early adulthood in recent years. To identify early\nsigns of functional deficits such as cognitive deficits in young\npeople with depression may aid this clinical direction. Another\nlimitation of the literature that challenged this review is the\nheterogeneous methodology of neuropsychological assessments\nand definitions of cognitive domains. We tried to address this\nlimitation by pre-defining cognitive domains and by aligning the\nindividual neuropsychological tests used in the original studies to\nthe pre-defined cognitive domains uniformly across the included\nstudies. Hence, we feel that the comparison of study results based\non this approach has gained validity and it reduced somewhat the\nheterogeneity of how cognitive domains were defined. Although\nthe calculation and comparison of effect sizes in our review is an\nadvantage over a purely narrative review, a meta-analysis would\nbe the preferred option; however the study base in the field of\nneuropsychological function in adolescents and young adults is\nstill limited and the heterogeneous methodology of how cognitive\ndomains were measured limits a meta-analytic approach at this\npoint in time, especially with the current small study base.\n\n6. Recommendations for future studies and conclusions\n\nThis review supports the view that a broader range and\nclinically meaningful neuropsychological deficits are present in\nadolescents and young adults with depression, which have clinical\nimplications for detection and treatment of mood disorders and\ndepression in particular in this age group. However, the clinical\nbase of case-control and prospective studies needs to be broa-\ndened generally, but specifically for understudied domains such as\nverbal learning and memory, visual (-spatial) memory and verbal\nfluency.\n\nSome of the differences in study results could possibly be\nattributed to the heterogeneity of applied methodology. Several\nrecommendations can be made to improve study design and\ncomparability between studies for future analyses. Specifically,\nfuture studies on neuropsychological function should investigate\ndiagnostic subgroups (e.g, melancholic, atypical) of depression,\nexplore more specifically the impact of clinical characteristics of\ndepression (e.g. symptom severity, comorbidity, disease status\nsuch as current and recurrent course, euthymic) as well as the\nonset, duration and number of depressive episodes. Importantly,\nfuture research could attempt to relate neuropsychological func-\ntioning to the staging model of depression in this age group\n(Hetrick et al., 2008). In addition, quality of life, daily functioning,\neducation and IQ need evaluation to specify the understanding\nof neuropsychological impairments (Beblo et al, 2011) in adoles-\ncence and young adults. Moreover, future study results would be\nbetter comparable across studies by using a more uniform\napproach to neuropsychological testing and evaluation as well as\nhomogeneous descriptions of the considered neuropsychological\n\n\n270 B.T. Baune et al. / Psychiatry Research 218 (2014) 261-271\n\ndomains. The consideration of mental and physical comorbidities\nas confounders when evaluating neuropsychological function\nappears to be a neglected area and requires more attention in\nfuture studies.\n\nFurthermore, prospective studies in this research area are\nlargely lacking apart from a few exceptions. A six-year follow-up\nstudy on predictors of long-term outcome after first hospital\nadmission of adolescent inpatients suggested that depression at\nfollow-up was predicted by admission symptomatology, but not by\ncognitive deficits (Pogge et al., 2008). Further research investigat-\ning the bi-directional longitudinal relationship between depres-\nsion and neuropsychological functioning would greatly enhance\nour clinical knowledge in this field by (a) exploring the long-\ntudinal nature and clinical relevance of neuropsychological\nimpairments associated with depression; (b) determining the\ndirection of effects between depression and neuropsychological\nimpairments and (c) investigating how these impairments may\naffect psychosocial and emotional developments over time. Addi\ntionally, it appears relevant to interpret neuropsychological func-\ntion and dysfunction in the context of physiological structural and\nfunctional maturation processes of the brain since some of the\nneuropsychological deficits such as in attentional processes might\nbe temporary. Since neuropsychological measures appear to be\nfine markers of psychosocial, emotional and brain maturation\nprocesses during adolescence and early adulthood, research find-\nings could turn into clinically useful measures of early signs of\ndepression in adolescents and young adults. Finally, an improved\nunderstanding of the complex relationship between depression\nand neuropsychological functioning during development offers\nopportunities for early detection, early intervention and improved\ntreatment outcomes of adolescents and young adults with mood\ndisorders.\n\nReferences\n\nAbela, J.
