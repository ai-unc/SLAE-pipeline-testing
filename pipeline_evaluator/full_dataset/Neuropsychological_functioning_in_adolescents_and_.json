The aim of this review is to evaluate literature on neuropsychological function in this youngage group. A database search of Medline, the Cochrane database and PsycInfo was conducted. Inclusion/exclusion criteria yielded seven case-control studies on neuropsychological functioning in MDD (12 \u201325years of age) published since 1995. Effect sizes were calculated. Results show a broader range ofstatistically signi \ufb01cant neuropsychological de \ufb01cits in MDD compared to controls in the cognitivedomains of executive function (EF), working memory (WM), psychomotor and processing speed (PPS),verbal \ufb02uency (VF) and visual (-spatial) memory (VM). Most convincingly, three out of four studiesinvestigating WM and three out of four studies investigating PPS found statistically signi \ufb01cantimpairments in MDD with varying effect sizes. EF de \ufb01cits were reported only in three out of sevenstudies with small, medium and large effect sizes. While some evidence was found for impaired VM andVF, no evidence was observed for attention and verbal learning and memory; however, these domainshave been less extensively studied. Further research is required to broaden the study base.&2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.Contents1.

IntroductionNeuropsychological dysfunction in depression has beenresearched for more than 50 years and is regarded as acharacteristic of depression indicating a broad pro \ufb01le of affectedneuropsychological domains such as memory, concentration anddecision-making ( Madden et al., 1952; Kiloh and Ball, 1961 ).Studies in adults and elderly samples have demonstrated thatdepression is associated with a variety of neuropsychologicalimpairments ( Purcell et al., 1997; Austin et al., 2001; Fossati,2002; Porter et al., 2003, 2007; Fossati et al., 2004; Harvey et al.,2004 ) such as in executive functioning, attention, memory, andContents lists available at ScienceDirectjournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/psychresPsychiatry Researchhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2014.04.0520165-1781/ &2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Baune).Psychiatry Research 218 (2014) 261 \u2013271psychomotor skills ( Sobin and Sackeim, 1997; Fossati et al., 1999,2004; Airaksinen et al., 2004; Gohier et al., 2009; Baune et al.,2010 ). In contrast, \ufb01ndings regarding the extent of impairments onneuropsychological tasks in samples of younger adults (21 \u201338years) with mild to moderate depression have been controversialsuggesting a lack of such de \ufb01cits in younger adults ( Grant et al.,2001; Wang et al., 2006; Casteneda et al., 2008 ). However, limiteddata has been published in the even younger age groups such asadolescence and early adulthood.Although the most consistently reported \ufb01ndings of neuropsy-chological impairments across age groups from younger adults toelderly include executive functioning ( Purcell et al., 1997; Fossatiet al., 1999; Grant et al., 2001; Harvey et al., 2004; Hill et al., 2004;Stordal et al., 2004; Smith and Muir, 2006; Taylor Tavares et al.,2007; Gohier et al., 2009 ), adult studies provide evidence tosuggest that depression is associated with global cognitive de \ufb01citsaffecting various neuropsychological domains ( Gualtieri et al.,2006 ).In contrast, there is a paucity of research about the potentialimpact of depression on neuropsychological functioning in peopleduring early adulthood and adolescence exposed to depression.This is important to note the consequences of early-onset depres-sion are often more severe, far-reaching and show more frequentdepressive episodes, possibly causing long-term social and mentaldisability as compared to later onset of depression in adulthood(Klein et al., 1999; Parker et al., 2003; Gollan et al., 2005a ). Inaddition, research has shown that the psychological, social, phy-sical and biological alterations occurring during adolescence aresigni\ufb01cant risk factors for the development of depression in youngage groups, with a clear increase in prevalence from age 13 yearsonwards ( Abela and Hakin, 2008; Lack and Green, 2009 ). Despitethe prevalence of depression in adolescents and young adultsbeing estimated similar to adults with 5.3% for a 12-month episodeand 13.2% for a lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD) ( Hasinet al., 2005 ), depressed young people are more likely to experiencerecurrent episodes of depression with increased likelihood ofsuicide, achieve lower educational attainment, and have a higherchance of unemployment and an increased risk of co-morbiditiesin adulthood ( Berndt et al., 2000; Parker et al., 2003; Gollan et al.,2005b; Calles, 2007 ), which taken together, potentially result insevere long-term psychosocial impairment ( Weissman et al., 1999;Dunn and Goodyer, 2006 ). Given this signi \ufb01cant long-term impactof depression at early onset on various outcomes, it is important tobetter understand the nature of neuropsychological function anddysfunction in this younger age group.Furthermore, since adult studies suggest a possible relevantfunctional relationship between neuropsychological function,employment status ( Baune et al., 2010 ) and general function(Airaksinen et al., 2006; Jaeger et al., 2006 ) in depression, a betterclinical description of neuropsychological function and dysfunc-tion in young people with depression would be an important stepforward to understand poor outcomes and help identify targets forintervention in depression. Moreover, whether adolescents andyoung adults are also prone to global cognitive de \ufb01cits or arebetter characterised by domain-speci \ufb01c cognitive disturbanceremains unclear, although some \ufb01rst evidence suggests domain-speci \ufb01cd e\ufb01cits such as in executive and working memory func-tioning ( Baune et al., 2012 ) and executive functioning in youngerdepressed individuals with early onset of depression ( Castanedaet al., 2008 ). Furthermore, studies in adults suggest that cognitivefunction may be present in a \ufb01rst episode of MDD (indicative of anearly sign of MDD) ( Lee et al., 2012 ) and may still be impaired atleast in some domains of cognitive function during remission ofdepression ( Hammar and Ardal, 2009 ) and importantly, thatcognitive dysfunction may have a role as a prognostic marker ofdepression ( Reppermund et al., 2009 ). These clinical observationson both cause and effects of cognitive dysfunction in depressionare highly important for clinical prevention and are unknown inthe younger age groups. The identi \ufb01cation and treatment ofcognitive de \ufb01cits in depression may help both in improvingclinical outcomes and possibly in identifying early signs of dete-rioration of mood states.Since these clinical observations demonstrate a need to focus onneuropsychological function in younger age groups, namely ado-lescents and early adults, it is necessary to frame the review in acontext of normative and disruptive brain developmental. Theeffects of depression in neuropsychological function may dependon the following brie \ufb02y described important principles of braindevelopment. First, while the developmental trajectory of greymatter (GM) volume follows an inverted U-shape, white matter(WM) volume increases steadily throughout childhood and adoles-cence and is likely to re \ufb02ect improved connectivity and integrationof disparate neural circuits ( Giedd et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2012 )a n dpossibly in \ufb02uencing cognitive abilities ( Tamnes et al., 2010 ). Withvarious brain regions undergoing different patterns of maturation,neural consequences of stress-related conditions such as depressiondepend on the developmental stage at which the stress anddepression occurred ( Reppermund et al., 2009 ). Therefore, stressand stress-related depression may have a greater impact oncognitive and emotional function in childhood and adolescence asthe brain experiences critical changes compared to adulthood.Second, since it has been reported that higher-order associationcortices develop only after lower-order sensorimotor cortices havematured in structure and function with the frontal lobe structures(e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)) involved in executivefunctioning, attention, motor coordination as well as heteromodalassociation regions the last areas to develop, it has been suggestedthat complex functions in higher-order structures are moresusceptible to the effects of stress-related conditions includingdepression due to protracted earlier periods of postnatal develop-ment ( Hammar and Ardal, 2009 ). Third, genetic and genderin\ufb02uences jointly contribute to individual differences in braindevelopment. Based on these principles of normative brain devel-opment, it can be hypothesised that a pathological brain conditionsuch as depression and related stressful experiences impact onneuropsychological function speci \ufb01cally in younger age groupsduring development.In summary, given (a) the reported functional implications ofneuropsychological de \ufb01cits in depression, (b) the proposed differ-ences in neuropsychological de \ufb01cits between young age groups,older adulthood and the elderly, (c) the likely impact of depressionon neuropsychological function during adolescence and youngeradulthood, and (d) the above mentioned neurobiological norma-tive developmental processes relevant to adolescence and youngadulthood (e.g., brain maturation and PFC development), thisreview focuses on studies in this particular age group.In this review we evaluate a range of cognitive domains ofneuropsychological function as published in the original studies.These include the domains of executive functioning, verbal learn-ing and memory, working memory, visual memory, attention andpsychomotor speed. The method and the results sections willde\ufb01ne the domains and list the individual cognitive test undereach domain for review. In summary, the aim of this review is tocharacterise a variety of domains of neuropsychological function indepression among individuals between adolescence and youngadulthood (12 \u201325 years of age).2. MethodsA literature search was performed using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, andPsycINFO databases covering publications from 1995 to 2014. The followingB.T. Baune et al. / Psychiatry Research 218 (2014) 261 \u2013271 262keywords were used to search for articles: youth OR adolescence AND majordepressive disorder OR depression OR depressive OR deprenOR early onsetdepression AND cognitive function OR neuropsychological AND impairment ORde\ufb01cit. The literature search was limited to English language and human studies.Additional articles were obtained by reviewing reference lists of research articles.Research articles conducting neuropsychological/neuropsychological assessmentbetween adolescence and adults with unipolar depression were considered forinclusion in the review. Initially, a total of 194 studies were retrieved using theseinitial search terms. The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied tothis pool of initial hits \u2013inclusion criteria: (1) age groups between 12 and 25 years;(2) case-control study; (3) primary diagnosis of depression; (4) lifetime diagnosis ofdepression; (5) current and/or previous episodes (including euthymic mood states)of depression; Exclusion criteria: (1) the study focus was on medical disorders (e.g.diabetes type 1); or (2) other psychiatric disorders as primary diagnosis (e.g.bipolar disorder, schizophrenia); (3) depression was regarded as co-morbidityrather than as primary diagnosis of unipolar depression and (4) developmentaldisorders were present. In addition, studies primarily investigating participantswith (5) psychotic depression or cognitive decline were excluded from this review.These criteria excluded also studies on participants with a simultaneous inclusionof an age range below and above 25 yrs of age (e.g. 17 \u201370 years of age). Hence, theapplied inclusion / exclusion criteria led to an age homogenous study base ofparticipants between 12 and 25 years of age making comparisons between studieshighly valid and not compounded by the simultaneous inclusion of older oryounger groups. The inclusion and exclusion process of primary studies wasperformed independently by two reviewers (MF, BTB). Disagreements on inclu-sion/exclusion of studies were resolved by consensus. Finally, a total of sevenarticles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and remained eligible for thisreview.The retrieved studies investigated various cognitive domains and a large variety ofindividual neuropsychological tests was used across studies. The underlying theore-tical construct of a neuropsychological domain was not consistently provided in eachstudy. As an overview, Table 1 lists the cognitive domains and related individualneuropsychological tests as used in the original studies. This review presents theresults based on neuropsychological constructs and individual tests of cognitivedomains as reported in the original studies. The review focuses on executive function,verbal \ufb02uency, working memory, verbal learning and memory, visual (-spatial)memory, attention and psychomotor and processing speed as these domains havebeen reported to show impairments in adults with depression ( Beblo et al., 2011; Rocket al., 2013 ). While we reported the individual tests and associated cognitive domainsas shown in the original studies (see Table 3 ), we re-ordered individual tests under themost appropriate cognitive domain, which might have been different from the originalstudy. Details of the alignment of individual tests and cognitive domains for thepurpose of this review are shown in Table 1 .In order to place the observed differences in neuropsychological functionbetween case and control groups across studies into a more meaningful context,effect sizes were included when reported in the original studies or calculation ofeffect sizes based on means and standard deviations or tvalues and d.f. werecarried out for the purpose of this review.

ResultsFor the purpose of this review, seven studies examiningneuropsychological functions in adolescents and young adultsbetween 12 and 25 years of age were identi \ufb01ed ful \ufb01lling theinclusion and exclusion criteria.

The results section presents the literature according tocognitive domains and individual test as used in the originalstudies (see Table 1 ). Results are presented based on effect sizesfor differences of neuropsychological function between depressedand control groups (see Tables 2 and 3 ).3.1. Cognitive domain-speci \ufb01c results3.1.1. Executive functionExecutive function (EF) is a neuropsychological construct todescribe the regulation of cognitive processes including a varietyof cognitive abilities such as working memory, \ufb02exibility, problemsolving, planning, execution and reasoning ( Chan et al., 2008 ). Alarge variety of individual tests as shown in Table 1 has beendeveloped and is commonly used to measure EF. However, rarelyhas the same neuropsychological construct or individual test beenemployed to measure EF across studies reviewed.All seven included studies employed at least one measure ofexecutive function as de \ufb01ned in Table 1 . In total, three out sevenstudies found impairments of individual measures of executivefunctioning with varying effect sizes (see Table 3 ). While one ofthese studies ( Klimkeit et al., 2011 ) reported a large effect size forpoorer results on a set-shifting task in MDD cases compared tocontrols, two others showed either medium ( Smith et al., 2006 )o rsmall ( Baune et al., 2012 ) effect sizes for worse performance on EFmeasures (Trail Making Test B; Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) in thedepressed groups compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, twoother single measures of EF (Brixton spatial anticipation test andStroop Colour-Word test) employed in the study by Smith et al.(2006) showed no differences between depressed and controlgroups, suggesting that EF de \ufb01cits in depressed individuals in theirstudy were speci \ufb01c to measures on the Trail Making Test B. Incontrast, four out of the seven studies found no signi \ufb01cantdifference in measures of EF ( McClure et al., 1997; Korhonenet al., 2002; Kyte et al., 2005; Matthews et al., 2008 ). All of thesefour studies used different single tests for EF and the study byMatthews et al. (2008) investigated females only which mighthave contributed to the heterogeneous negative results. In total ofthe seven studies, only two studies used the same measure of EF,namely the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), however, withopposing results. The positive study by Baune et al. (2012) used\u2018total errors \u2019and \u2018categories completed \u2019of the WCST as singlemeasures of EF as compared to the negative study by Kyte et al.(2005) , that emphasised on attentional \ufb02exibility by using the\u2018Intra-Dimensional, Extra-Dimensional Set-Shifting task \u2019derivedfrom the WCST. These results again suggest that results on thecognitive domain of EF across studies largely depend on the use ofthe individual tests. Since verbal \ufb02uency is frequently regarded as ameasure of EF, the results reported here show two studiesexplicitly examining this domain as part of EF. It was found thatparticipants with minor depression compared to controls hadde\ufb01cits in verbal \ufb02uency showing a large effect size, whereasMDD patients remained unaffected in the same study ( Klimkeitet al., 2011 ). In a second study on verbal \ufb02uency studied as part ofEF and investigating a similar age group between 12 and 17 yearsof age showed a contrasting result as the controlled oral wordassociation test and the test of clinical evaluation of languagefunctions (CELF) showed no impairments in verbal \ufb02uency in thedepressed group compared to controls ( McClure et al., 1997 ).3.1.2.

Baune et al. / Psychiatry Research 218 (2014) 261 \u2013271 266and indicates various ways to classify types of memory (e.g.declarative and procedural memory, retrospective and prospectivememory). The types of memory investigated in studies on neu-ropsychological performance in adolescents and young adultsincluded in this review include working memory ,verbal learningand memory , and visual (-spatial )memory . The processing of verbaland visual (-spatial) stimuli within the working memory can beregarded as part of the storage process.3.1.2.1. Working memory. Working memory (WM) is a model ofactive maintenance of information in the short-term storageformulated by Baddeley and Hitch that consists of three basicstores: the central executive, the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad ( Baddeley, 2000 ). Due to the executivecomponent of this model, working memory is often, but notconsistently, regarded as part of executive function. For thepurpose of this review, working memory is listed under a broadmemory domain. Four out of seven studies investigated workingmemory by using a variety of individual tests, such as Digit Span,n-back, Wechsler Memory Scale and Spatial Working Memory(SWM). While two studies found no evidence for working memoryde\ufb01cits ( Korhonen et al., 2002; Baune et al., 2012 ), two studiesreported medium to large effect sizes. Of these, one study reporteda large effect size for working memory differences between MDDand controls using a Spatial Working Memory task ( Matthewset al., 2008 ), whereas the other study found signi \ufb01cantimpairment for both the minor depression group (large effectsize) and medium effect sizes for the MDD group using themeasure of digit span ( Klimkeit et al., 2011 ).3.1.2.2. Verbal learning and memory. Verbal learning (VL) istypically associated with the memorisation and retention of listsof words, in order to describe basic elements of associativelearning. Verbal learning tends to involve more than just thememorisation of words since many stimuli such as pictures,odours, locations, etc. can be studied. During verbal learningand memory tasks, the types of mental events that occur inverbal learning studies go beyond passive memorisation, aslearners can play a very active role in manipulating experimentalstimuli.The domain of verbal learning and memory was investigated inthree ( McClure et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2006; Baune et al., 2012 )out of the seven studies, none of which showed signi \ufb01cantdifferences between depressed and control groups. Two of thesenegative studies employed the California Verbal Learning Test(CVLT )(McClure et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2006 ), which allows adirect comparison of study results, whereas the third other studyused the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RVLT )(Baune et al.,2012 ).3.1.2.3. Visual (-spatial) memory. Visual memory (VM) describesthe relationship between perceptual processing and the storageand retrieval of the resulting neural representations. Thosememories of visual images (e.g., dinner plates) are stored inwhat is called visual memory.This domain was investigated in a small number of two studies,one of which found numerous differences of large effect sizesbetween depressed and control groups related to tests results ofpattern and spatial recognition ,delayed matching to sample (DMtS )and paired associated learning(PAL)(Matthews et al., 2008 ). Theother study reported a negative \ufb01nding on visual-spatial memoryusing the Rey Osterreith Complex Figure-Recall and Non-VerbalSelective Reminding Tests (McClure et al., 1997 ). Interestingly,MDD patients showed poorer performance with a large effect sizefor a measure of visual spatial perception ( Judgement of lineorientation test \u2013JOL), which is regarded as a cognitive ability thatmay in \ufb02uence visual memory performance ( McClure et al., 1997 ).3.1.3. AttentionAttention (A) is a cognitive process of selectively concentratingon one aspect while ignoring other aspects of the environmentand belongs to a commonly studied cognitive domain in depres-sion research. In the domain of attention, impairments of selectiveattention, divided attention, and vigilance have been reported indepression ( Beblo et al., 2011 ). However, it is still a matter ofdebate whether depressed patients show cognitive slowing.Christensen et al. (1997) conclude from their meta-analysis thatdepressed adult patients show impaired performance on timedtasks, but it remains unclear whether this impairment is due to aslowing of cognitive processing or, alternatively, has to beregarded as a consequence of the increased rumination that isregularly reported among patients with depression.Our review shows that the domain of attention has rarely beenexamined in this cohort applying a widely accepted measure ofattention such as a behavioural inhibition test (affective Go, No-Gotask). In the 12 \u201325 years age group, a single study showed nodifferences in attention using this measure between cases andcontrols ( Kyte et al., 2005 ).3.1.4. Psychomotor and processing speedPsychomotor processing speed (PPS) is based on the measure ofreaction time to a task that measures time elapsed between thepresentation of a sensory stimulus and the subsequent beha-vioural response. Typical measures of processing speed are simplereaction time ,recognition ,choice reaction time (CRT),Digit SymbolSubstitution Test ,discrimination reaction time ,Trail Making Test A .I nthe studies included in this review, the domain of psychomotorand processing speed was measured by using a variety of testsincluding individual tests in the areas of both cognitive speed andTable 3Statistically signi \ufb01cant neuropsychological impairments in MDD showing effect size estimations in seven case-control studies among adolescents and young adults withMDD.aCategory ofeffect sizesbExecutive function(7 studies)cVerbal \ufb02uency(1 study)cVerbal learning andmemory (3 studies)cWorking memory(4 studies)cVisual (-spatial)memory (2 studies)cAttention(1 study)cPsychomotor/processing/cognitive speed (4 studies)cSmall \u00fe \u2013\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013Medium \u00fe \u2013\u2013 \u00fe \u2013\u2013 \u00fe\u00feLarge \u00fe\u00fe \u2013 \u00fe\u00fe \u00fe \u2013 \u00fe\u00fe\u00feDenotes number of studies showing signi \ufb01cant effect sizes in the respective neuropsychological domain.\u2013Denotes no signi \ufb01cant differences between depression and controls.aEffect sizes are reported for studies with statistically signi \ufb01cant differences in neuropsychological performance between MDD and control subjects.bEffect sizes for signi \ufb01cant results on individual neuropsychological test differences between depressed participants and controls: small effect size r0.5; medium effectsize40.5 and o0.8; and large effect size Z0.8 (Cohen, 1988).cNumber of studies that investigated this domain.B.T.

In total, four out of seven studiesemployed individual tests measuring this domain including onestudy measuring processing speed as part of the executivefunctioning construct ( Korhonen et al., 2002 ) that showed nega-tive results for PPS. In a single study, euthymic MDD patientsperformed worse on the Trail Making Test A compared to controlswith a medium effect size ( Smith et al., 2006 ) suggesting proces-sing speed de \ufb01cits even during remission. In addition, two studiesreported impaired psychomotor processing speed in depressedparticipants compared to controls with differing effect sizesdepending on subdomains: large effect sizes were found for testsof psychomotor skills (slower movement times) ( Matthews et al.,2008 ) and motor speed (slower movement preparation andexecution times) ( Klimkeit et al., 2011 ), and additionally, in thestudy by Klimkeit et al. (2011) , medium effect sizes were found fordifferences between depressed and control groups on a task ofcognitive speed (inspection and reaction times). This study(Klimkeit et al., 2011 ) has used separate measures for cognitivespeed and motor speed, whereas the study by Matthews et al.(2008) employed a combined measure of psychomotor speed.4. DiscussionThis review of neuropsychological performance in depressedadolescents and young adults (12 \u201325 years) shows that a limitednumber of case-control studies have been performed and noprospective studies are published in this age group. The main\ufb01ndings suggest that depression in this younger age group isrelated to neuropsychological impairment in a variety of cognitivedomains. Most convincingly, three out of four studies investigatingWM and three out of four studies investigating PPS foundstatistically signi \ufb01cant effect sizes in MDD. EF de \ufb01cits werereported only in three out of seven studies with small, mediumand large effect sizes indicating less consistent evidence for EFde\ufb01cits in MDD in adolescents and young adults. While someevidence was found for impaired VM and VF, no evidence wasobserved for attention and verbal learning and memory; however,these domains have been less extensively studied.A limited number of studies have been performed to testperformance in verbal \ufb02uency, verbal learning and memory, visual(-spatial) memory and attention, although the limited studiesshow high effect sizes for de \ufb01cits in VF and VM. Importantly,these domains are clearly understudied. A little more consistently,negative \ufb01ndings have been reported for the domain of verballearning and memory, however, this domain has a small studybase of three original investigations only.Although neuropsychological impairments have often beenregarded as a feature of older adults and the elderly withdepression, our review suggests that the younger adults andadolescents with depression already exhibit neuropsychologicalde\ufb01cits primarily in the domains of executive function, workingmemory and psychomotor speed. The importance of the early ageof depression onset for the presence of neuropsychological de \ufb01citshas been underscored by a study on cognitive functioning in apopulation-based sample of young adults (aged 21 \u201335 years) witha lifetime history of non-psychotic unipolar depressive disorder.While no cognitive de \ufb01cits were reported for the whole sample(21\u201335 years of age), younger age at depression onset wasassociated with impaired executive functioning ( Castaneda et al.,2008) as compared to the whole sample with early and later onsetof depression, which is suggesting that onset of depression at ayounger age might be more relevant to neuropsychological dys-function (EF in this case) than higher age at onset of depression.The results of our review show large similarities with studieson neuropsychological performance in adults with depression onseveral of the affected cognitive domains in both age groups. Arecent meta-analysis revealed signi \ufb01cant moderate cognitive def-icits in executive function, memory and attention in adult patientswith current or remitted depression relative to controls (Cohen's deffect sizes ranging from /C00.34 to /C00.65) based on studiesemploying the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test AutomatedBattery (CANTAB) ( Rock et al., 2013 ). Interestingly, the effect sizesof de \ufb01cits in these domains reported in our review tended besomewhat higher (range Z0.8) than in the meta-analysis by Rocket al. (2013) (ranging from /C00.34 to /C00.65). Even across differentlarge neuropsychological test batteries, the domains of attention,executive function, and memory have been reported to be pri-marily affected in adult depression ( Beblo and Lautenbacher,2006 ). Overall, the moderate to large effect sizes as reported inour review, indirectly corroborate previous postulates suggestingthat the severity and the pro \ufb01le of cognitive de \ufb01ciencies indepression is clinically relevant and comparable to those seen inmoderately severe traumatic brain injury ( Veiel, 1997 ).The\ufb01nding in our review about impaired psychomotor andprocessing speed is worth discussing further. Two out of fourstudies found slower psychomotor processing speed and reactiontime in adolescents and young adults with depression compared tocontrols ( Matthews et al., 2008; Klimkeit et al., 2011 ). The study byKlimkeit et al. (2011) reported both statistically signi \ufb01cant cogni-tive speed (inspection time, reaction time) and motor speed(movement preparation time) de \ufb01cits, whereas the study byMatthews et al. (2008) employed a measure that combined bothreaction time and movement times, suggesting that the underlyingconstructs for motor and cognitive speed are similar across bothstudies. Moreover, two other studies reported different results inthe PPS domain. The cross-sectional study by Korhonen et al. foundno impairment on motor speed in 16 treatment seeking adoles-cents (aged 16 to 20 years) measured by using Stroop Colour-Wordtest and Trail Making Tests B ( Korhonen et al., 2002 ); unfortunately,the authors did not specify in their report how motor speed wasmeasured speci \ufb01cally using those tests. In contrast, Kyte et al.reported that recently depressed adolescents ( \ufb01rst episode) werefaster (rather than slower) to make their decision on a decision-making task ( po0.02) ( Kyte et al., 2005 ). According to the authors,this latter \ufb01nding was probably associated with increased impul-sivity, and less speci \ufb01c to psychomotor speed. However, whenevaluating psychomotor speed, a clear distinction between tasksmeasuring motor speed and cognitive processing speed is impor-tant since motor speed appears to be a function that may reachmaturity by early adolescence ( Huttenlocher and Dabholkar, 1997 ),whereas cognitive processing speed and reaction time are mea-sures that continue to progress through adolescence ( Andersonet al., 2001; Leon-Carrion et al., 2004; Luna et al., 2004; Lucianaet al., 2005 ). These \ufb01ndings might also be related to elevatedglucocorticoid levels associated with chronic stress in depression,as correlations have been found between improvement of informa-tion processing speed and a reduction in cortisol levels ( Zobel et al.,2004; Reppermund et al., 2007 ), however, none of the studiesincluded in this review have published cortisol levels.In this review we decided to include a response inhibition(using an affective Go, No-Go task) as a measure of attention thatshowed no de \ufb01cits in this domain. Although this single studyresult is preliminary, this may suggest that the domain of attentionis less typically affected in adolescents and young adults ascompared to adults and elderly studies ( Beblo and Lautenbacher,2006; Klimkeit et al., 2011 ).It has previously been suggested that higher severity (see meta-analysis by McDermott and Ebmeier, 2009 ), recurrent episodes(Andersson et al., 2010 ) and remission status ( Baune et al., 2010;Bhardwaj et al., 2010; Rock et al., 2013 )i nd e p r e s s i o ni na d u l t sa r erelated to more severe impairment of neuropsychological functionB.T. Baune et al. / Psychiatry Research 218 (2014) 261 \u2013271 268as compared to healthy controls. Although the study base inadolescents and young adults as reported in our review is small,\ufb01rst observations have been made to suggest that a \ufb01rst episode ofdepression is associated with poorer function in executive function,motor speed, cognitive speed and working memory ( Klimkeit et al.,2011 ). In contrast, a study in \ufb01rst episode depression reported nodifferences between cases and healthy controls in executive func-tioning, attentional \ufb02exibility and behavioural inhibition tasks ( Kyteet al., 2005 ). However, the differences between the Klimkeit et al.(2011) and Kyte et al. (2005) studies might be due to measuringdepressive symptoms related to the \ufb01rst depressive episode atdifferent time-points: while the study with positive results testeddepressive symptoms at the time of the \ufb01rst episode of depression(Klimkeit et al., 2011 ), the negative study included participants witha\ufb01rst episode in the past year; hence, several of the participantsmost likely were not severely depressed at the time of testing asindicated by data from the depression measure at study commence-ment ( Kyte et al., 2005 ). However, when strict criteria for euthymicmood states of MDD at study commencement were applied, ourreview reported from a single study that 42 euthymic MDD patientsshowed poorer performance on Trail Making Test A and TrailMaking Test B of large to moderate effect sizes ( d\u00bc1.01 andd\u00bc0.76, respectively). Since no other studies with young (12 \u201325years of age) MDD participants of euthymic mood states have beenpublished so far, further research into the important questionwhether neuropsychological impairment is a state, trait or both indepression is required.Moreover, the diagnostic classi \ufb01cation of mood disorder is ofparticular importance for evaluating neuropsychological de \ufb01cits inmood disorders of young adults and adolescents. The literature inolder adults suggests that Bipolar Disorder (BD) is associated withlarger neuropsychological de \ufb01cits as compared to MDD ( Burt et al.,2000 ), although other studies suggest at least similar levels ofimpairments for both MDD and BD disorder patients ( TaylorTavares et al., 2007 ). In our review, we identi \ufb01ed a single studythat compared neuropsychological de \ufb01cits in MDD to bipolarspectrum disorder (BSD) and reported that BSD patients per-formed worse on tasks for verbal memory (short delay recall,p\u00bc0.009 and recognition hits, p\u00bc0.02) and on Trail Making Test B(p\u00bc0.03) ( Smith et al., 2006 ). Further research is needed in theadolescent and young adult groups to explore the characteristicsand possible differences between MDD and BD in this age group.Additional clinical factors such as comorbidity may in \ufb02uencethe reported results, although this area is still controversial(Castaneda et al., 2010 ). For example, the comorbidity status(e.g., ADHD) in depressed adolescents and young adults may havesigni\ufb01cant impact on cognitive function potentially causing asubstantial bias in the results of the neuropsychological evaluationin this age group ( Favre et al., 2009; Klimkeit et al., 2011 ).Although several of the primary studies assessed such comorbid-ity, their consideration in the analyses is limited in the reviewedstudies and need consistent consideration in future studies.Similarly, this requirement applies to medical comorbidities as ithas been shown that chronic medical conditions such as diabetestype I with comorbid depression, are associated with neuropsy-chological impairment ( Sinnamon et al., 2013 ). In general, sinceclinical factors such as comorbidities have previously been shownto impact on cognitive function in adult depression ( Beblo et al.,2011 ), careful consideration of these factors is warranted in futurestudies on cognitive function in depression in younger age groups.5. Limitations and strengthsThe presented review has strengths and limitations. Due to theage inclusion criteria of 12 \u201325 years of age, a number of studies inadults and in children were excluded. This approach left thereview with a small study base of seven original studies inadolescents and young adults (12 \u201325 years of age). The interpreta-tion of the presented results needs to consider this small studybase and caution is warranted. However, since numerous reviewsand meta-analyses have already been undertaken on neuropsy-chological function in depression in adults, we aimed at theadolescent and young adult age group for this review. Accordingly,we excluded studies that spanned across both adult and adoles-cence age groups in the same study in order to be able to make anage-speci \ufb01c comparison of studies in the chosen age bracket of12\u201325 years. This focus, albeit limited, may also be seen asadvantageous in the context of the international clinical focus onunderstanding and tracing the early development of mental ill-ness, its early detection and intervention as well as prevention inadolescents and early adulthood in recent years. To identify earlysigns of functional de \ufb01cits such as cognitive de \ufb01cits in youngpeople with depression may aid this clinical direction. Anotherlimitation of the literature that challenged this review is theheterogeneous methodology of neuropsychological assessmentsand de \ufb01nitions of cognitive domains. We tried to address thislimitation by pre-de \ufb01ning cognitive domains and by aligning theindividual neuropsychological tests used in the original studies tothe pre-de \ufb01ned cognitive domains uniformly across the includedstudies. Hence, we feel that the comparison of study results basedon this approach has gained validity and it reduced somewhat theheterogeneity of how cognitive domains were de \ufb01ned. Althoughthe calculation and comparison of effect sizes in our review is anadvantage over a purely narrative review, a meta-analysis wouldbe the preferred option; however the study base in the \ufb01eld ofneuropsychological function in adolescents and young adults isstill limited and the heterogeneous methodology of how cognitivedomains were measured limits a meta-analytic approach at thispoint in time, especially with the current small study base.6. Recommendations for future studies and conclusionsThis review supports the view that a broader range andclinically meaningful neuropsychological de \ufb01cits are present inadolescents and young adults with depression, which have clinicalimplications for detection and treatment of mood disorders anddepression in particular in this age group. However, the clinicalbase of case-control and prospective studies needs to be broa-dened generally, but speci \ufb01cally for understudied domains such asverbal learning and memory, visual (-spatial) memory and verbal\ufb02uency.Some of the differences in study results could possibly beattributed to the heterogeneity of applied methodology. Severalrecommendations can be made to improve study design andcomparability between studies for future analyses. Speci \ufb01cally,future studies on neuropsychological function should investigatediagnostic subgroups (e.g., melancholic, atypical) of depression,explore more speci \ufb01cally the impact of clinical characteristics ofdepression (e.g., symptom severity, comorbidity, disease statussuch as current and recurrent course, euthymic) as well as theonset, duration and number of depressive episodes. Importantly,future research could attempt to relate neuropsychological func-tioning to the staging model of depression in this age group(Hetrick et al., 2008 ). In addition, quality of life, daily functioning,education and IQ need evaluation to specify the understandingof neuropsychological impairments ( Beblo et al., 2011 ) in adoles-cence and young adults. Moreover, future study results would bebetter comparable across studies by using a more uniformapproach to neuropsychological testing and evaluation as well ashomogeneous descriptions of the considered neuropsychologicalB.T. Baune et al. / Psychiatry Research 218 (2014) 261 \u2013271 269domains. The consideration of mental and physical comorbiditiesas confounders when evaluating neuropsychological functionappears to be a neglected area and requires more attention infuture studies.Furthermore, prospective studies in this research area arelargely lacking apart from a few exceptions. A six-year follow-upstudy on predictors of long-term outcome after \ufb01rst hospitaladmission of adolescent inpatients suggested that depression atfollow-up was predicted by admission symptomatology, but not bycognitive de \ufb01cits ( Pogge et al., 2008 ). Further research investigat-ing the bi-directional longitudinal relationship between depres-sion and neuropsychological functioning would greatly enhanceour clinical knowledge in this \ufb01eld by (a) exploring the long-itudinal nature and clinical relevance of neuropsychologicalimpairments associated with depression; (b) determining thedirection of effects between depression and neuropsychologicalimpairments and (c) investigating how these impairments mayaffect psychosocial and emotional developments over time. Addi-tionally, it appears relevant to interpret neuropsychological func-tion and dysfunction in the context of physiological structural andfunctional maturation processes of the brain since some of theneuropsychological de \ufb01cits such as in attentional processes mightbe temporary. Since neuropsychological measures appear to be\ufb01ne markers of psychosocial, emotional and brain maturationprocesses during adolescence and early adulthood, research \ufb01nd-ings could turn into clinically useful measures of early signs ofdepression in adolescents and young adults. Finally, an improvedunderstanding of the complex relationship between depressionand neuropsychological functioning during development offersopportunities for early detection, early intervention and improvedtreatment outcomes of adolescents and young adults with mooddisorders.ReferencesAbela, J., Hakin, B., 2008.

            "SupportingText": "All seven included studies employed at least one measure of executive function as defined in Table 1. In total,three out of seven studies found impairments of individual measures of executive functioning with varying effect sizes(see Table 3). While one of these studies(Klimkeit et al., 2011) reported a large effect size for poorer results on a set-shifting task in MDD cases compared to controls,two others showed either medium(Smith et al., 2006) or small (Baune et al., 2012) effect sizes for worse performance o nEF measures(Trail Making Test B; Wisconsin Card SortingTest)in the depressed groups compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, two other single measures of EF (Brixton spatial anticipation testand Stroop Colour-Word test)employed in the study by Smith et al. (2006) showed no differences between depressed andcontrol groups, suggesting that EF deficits in depressed individuals in their study were specific to measures on the Trail Making Test B. In contrast,four out of the seven studies found no significant difference in measures of EF(McClure etal., 1997; Korhonen et al., 2002; Kyteetal., 2005; Matthewsetal., 2008). All of these four studies used different single tests for EF and the study by Matthewsetal. (2008) investigated females only which might have contributed to the heterogeneous negative results.In total of the seven studies,only two studies used the same measure of EF, namely the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test(WCST), however,with ‘totalerrors’ and ‘categoriescompleted’ of the WCST as single measures of EF as compared to the negative study by Kyteetal. (2005), that emphasised on attentional flexibility by using the ‘Intra-Dimensional, Extra-DimensionalSet-Shiftingtask ’ derived from theWCST.These results again suggest that results on the cognitive domain of EF across studies largely depend on the use of the individual tests. Since verbal fluency is frequently regarded as a measure of EF, the results reported here show two studies explicitly examining this domain as part of EF. It was found that participants with minor depression compared to controls had deficits inverbal fluency showing a large effect size, whereas MDD patients remained unaffected in the same study(Klimkeit et al., 2011). In a second study on verbal fluency studied as part of EF and investigating a similar age group between 12 and 17 years of age showed a contrasting result as the controlled oral word association test and the test of clinical evaluation of language functions (CELF)showed no impairments in verbal fluency in the depressed group compared to controls(McClure et al., 1997)."

While two studies found no evidence for working memory deficits (Korhonenetal., 2002; Bauneetal., 2012), two studies reported medium to large effect sizes. Of these,one study reported a large effect size for workingmemory differences between MDD and controls using a Spatial Working Memory task(Matthews et al., 2008), whereas the other study found significant impairment for both the minor depression group(large effect size) and medium effect sizes for the MDD group using the measure of digit span(Klimkeit et al., 2011)"

The results for PPS (processing speed) showed that in a single study, euthymic MDD (major depressive disorder) patients performed worse on the Trail Making Test A compared to controls, suggesting speed deficits even during remission. Additionally, two studies reported impaired psychomotor processing speed in depressed participants compared to controls, with differing effect sizes depending on subdomains. Large effect sizes were found for tests of psychomotor skills (slower movement times) (Matthews et al., 2008) and motor speed (slower movement preparation and execution times) (Klimkeit et al., 2011). Furthermore, in the study by Klimkeit et al. (2011), medium effect sizes were found for differences between depressed and control groups on a task of cognitive speed (inspection and reaction times). This study (Klimkeit et al., 2011) has used separate measures for cognitive speed and motor speed, whereas the study by Matthews et al. (2008) employed a combined measure of psychomotor speed."
