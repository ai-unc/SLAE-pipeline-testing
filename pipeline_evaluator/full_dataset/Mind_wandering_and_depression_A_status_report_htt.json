Nevertheless, to our knowledge, Watts and Sharrock were the first to define mind blanking as an off-task state without thoughts. In spite of their efforts, research on mind blanking was only revived much later by other groups (e.g. Kawagoe et al., 2019; Ward and Wegner, 2013)."

In patients exhibiting low levels of self-compassion, MW differentially related to depressive symptoms scores, but not in patients with high levels of self-compassion. Following MBCT training, patients assigned to the MBCT group scored significantly lower on the BDI-II (average score, pre: 23.6, post: 12.2), HAMD-28 (average score, pre: 22.8, post: 12.7) and the MWQ, and higher on the SCS than those undergoing regular treatment.

Therefore, it remains an open\nDepression question whether patterns of MW are altered in depression and, if so, how these alterations are related to\n\nBevettonce sampling rumination. Here, we review and discuss studies investigating MW in cohorts, showing either a clinically sig-\nSovcained attention ms response tsk (SART) nificant depression or with clinically significant disorders accompanied by depressive symptoms. These studies\nSelfreport scales yield first tentative insights into major issues. However, further investigations are required, specifically studies\nMeta-awareness ‘which: i) compare patients with a primary diagnosis of major depression with healthy and appropriately matched\ncontrols, if) implement measures of both MW and rumination, iii) are based on experience sampling (in com-\nbination with other key approaches), iv) compare experience sampling during daily life, resting state and\nattentional tasks, v) explore possible biases in the assessment of MW, vi) acquire data not only related to the\npropensity and contents of MW, but also regarding meta-awareness and intentionality.\n\n1. Introduction we try to contribute knowledge to fil this gap and to evaluate a possible\nrole of MW in clinical contexts.\n\nThe term “mind wandering” (MW) refers to the production of\nthoughts or images which are unrelated to our external surroundings\nand the task at hand, and therefore usually distract attention to some\ndegree (e.g. Schooler et al, 2011). The person may be aware of having\nthese thoughts or images (meta-awareness) or only becomes aware of\nthem if prompted. Within the remit of this review, rumination will be\nregarded as a special subtype of MW (e.g. van Vugt et al., 2018), which is\nmainly characterized by its perseverative (if not pressing) nature and\nnegative contents (e.g. negatively biased memories and thoughts about\none’s future) (Smith and Alloy, 2009). Alternatively, rumination has\nbeen seen as a phenomenon distinct from MW (e.g. Christoff et al., 2016;\nFox et al, 2018) or overlapping with MW (e.g. Linz et al, 2021).\nRumination is commonly seen as the cognitive key symptom of\ndepression (e.g. Spinhoven et al, 2018), and as such became one major\ntarget of cognitive psychotherapy for depression (e.g. Kovics et al.,\n2020) including newer mindfulness-based approaches (e.g van der\nVelden et al., 2015). However, it remains unclear whether the emer-\ngence of rumination rather is an isolated symptom or whether broader\ndistortions in the amount and characteristics of MW occur in depression.\nWhile many clinical studies and overviews on the contribution of\nrumination to depression have been published, relatively few data on\nthe role of MW in general are available. With the present status report,\n\n1.1. Mind wandering\n\nThe investigation of MW is based on different methodological ap-\nproaches, which aided to the organization of the present report. A\ncommonly used approach is to collect data based on subjective self-\nrating scales (e.g. Mowlem et al, 2019; Mrazek et al, 2013a, b).\n‘These scales require participants to score different aspects of their MW\nand allow researchers to harvest relatively large amounts of data, but\nmay depend on the subjects’ sincerity, reflective capability and\nself-image. It is fair to state that the majority of clinical studies on\nrumination are based on a retrospective and introspective ques-\ntionnaire/interview approach. An alternative, temporally more specific\napproach is to assess resting state or everyday MW based on so-called\nexperience sampling, i.e. in real time (e.g. Killingsworth and Gilbert,\n2010). Hereby, visual or auditory prompts require participants to\ndescribe or rate their MW (or its absence) experienced just prior to the\nappearance of the prompt. Finally, a third mostly laboratory-based\napproach is to apply experience sampling during simple well-defined\nattentional paradigms, which also allows quantifying the objective ef-\nfects of MW on performance (e.g. Weinstein, 2018). Often vigilance\ntasks are used, since these are known to stimulate MW due to their\n\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: leila. chaicb@ukbonn. de (L.

In such paradigms, experience sampling probes\nmay inquire, for instance, whether participants were focused on task\nperformance or not, and if not, what their thought contents were.\nImportantly, task performance measures such as reaction times or error\nrates can reveal the objective attentional effects of MW, in addition to\nthe introspective data.\n\n‘The phenomenology of MW is complex and multifaceted. It can, for\ninstance, consist of inner speech or imagery, be self-related or not, be\noriented towards the past, present or future, have a positive, neutral, or\nnegative valence, be intentional or unintentional, and be accompanied\nby meta-awareness or not (for reviews see Schooler et al, 2011;\nSmallwood and Schooler, 2015). All these characteristics are dependent\non the individual, as well as on the situation and environmental context.\nMW can exert positive and/or negative effects (Mooneyham and\nSchooler, 2013). Amongst the positive effects are enhanced creativity\n(Leszczynski et al, 2017; Yamaoka and Yukawa, 2020), improved\nproblem solving (Ruby et al., 2013b) and better future planning (Oet-\ntingen and Schworer, 2013). The negative effects range from increased\nreaction times and errors in ongoing perceptual and cognitive tasks\n(Leszezynski et al., 2017; McVay and Kane, 2009) to increased stress\nlevels (Engert et al, 2014) and a decline in mood (Yamaoka and\nYukawa, 2020). This decline in mood has not only be observed during\nunpleasant, but also during neutral MW (Killingsworth and Gilbert,\n2010). Reduced mood conversely causes more frequent episodes of MW\n(Smallwood et al., 2009), resulting in a vicious circle.\n\nTwo important frameworks addressing the role of attention in MW\nare the attentional resource and the executive failure theory (Smallwood\nand Schooler, 2006; McVay and Kane, 2010). According to the first\ntheory, MW consumes attentional resources causing perceptual decou-\npling and attentional withdrawal from task execution (Smallwood and\nSchooler, 2006). In this construct, MW utilises the same resources and\nmechanisms as executive control. According to the second framework\nMW reflects failures of the executive control system and is not, per se,\nresource dependent (McVay and Kane, 2010). More recently, a theory\nhas been proposed which integrates aspects of both frameworks. Ac-\ncording to the resource-control theory (Thomson et al, 2015),\nself-generated thought is the default state of the individual and attention\nis continuously biased towards this state. Therefore, executive control is\nrequired to prevent MW from consuming attentional resources needed\nfor task performance. With regard to phenomenology, MW has been\nsuggested to be a member of a family of spontaneous thought processes\nincluding, for instance, creative thought and dreaming (Christof et al.,\n2016). Furthermore, spontaneous thought including MW has been\nconceptualized as an unconstrained memory process with the stream of\nthoughts flowing through the landscape of memories (Mildner and\nTamir, 2019).\n\nWhile the neurobiological underpinnings of MW are not fully un-\nderstood, mainly activity in the default mode network (DMN) and in\nfronto-parietal control regions, such as dorso-, rostro- and ventrolateral\nprefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule, has been shown to play a\nmajor role (e.g. Christoff et al, 2009; Mason et al, 2007; for a\nmeta-analysis, see Fox et al., 2015). Several neuroimaging studies have\nparticularly pointed to the relevance of the medial temporal lobe (MTL),\n‘which is part of the DMN. Two recent studies, for instance, investigating\nMW in patients with hippocampal damage and in MTL epilepsy patients,\nindicated that past-oriented MW depends on hippocampal activity\n(Krakau et al., 2020; McCormick et al., 2018).\n\n1.2. Rumination\n\nRumination (zoological meaning: regurgitation of food) refers to\n\"obsessional thinking involving excessive, repetitive thoughts or themes\nthat interfere with other forms of mental activity\" (Rumination - APA\nDictionary of Psychology, 2021). While this term can also be used in a\nnon-pathological sense (e.g. to ruminate on a mathematical\n\nNeuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 133 (2022) 104505\n\nconundrum), it more specifically indicates automatic and persistent\ndwelling on negative thoughts with depressing, disgusting or threat-\nening content in the context of affective, obsessive-compulsive or\ngeneralized anxiety disorders, respectively (for a thorough review of the\nrumination concept see Smith and Alloy, 2009). Rumination is also\nassociated with post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (Arditte Hall\net al, 2019) and suicidality (Morrison and O'Connor, 2008). Thus,\nrumination is a transdiagnostic psychopathological symptom and ther-\napy target (Drost et al., 2014; Hejazi and McCallum, 2014).\n\nA series of measures for rumination have been developed (e.g. the\n10-item Self-Critical Rumination Scale (Smart et al., 2016); for a critical\noverview see Samtani and Moulds, 2017). In models of depression,\ndepressive rumination is considered as a (i) predisposing cognitive\nvulnerability factor (i.e. a trait) which also contributes to explaining the\nincreased prevalence of depression amongst women (Kertz et al., 2019\nPapadakis et al., 2006; more controversially, Shors et al., 2017); (ii) a\nmaladaptive strategy for emotion regulation which mediates the\ndevelopment of depression after stressful life events (Demeyer et al.,\n2012; LeMoult and Gotlib, 2019); (iii) one cognitive key symptom of\nacute depression (i.e. a [pathological] state) which improves together\nwith mood during therapy (Spinhoven et al., 2018); and, as such, (iv) an\nimportant leverage point for the causal treatment of unipolar and bi-\npolar depression within the framework of cognitive-behavior therapy\n(CBT) (Kovacs et al., 2020) or mindfulness-based stress reduction-based\ntreatments (van der Velden et al., 2015). From the early behavioristic\nstopping-technique approaches (Stern et al., 1973; Wolpe and Lazarus,\n1966), which conceptualized rumination as covered (\"private\") verbal\nbehavior, to rumination-focused CBT for residual depression (e.g. Cook\nand Watkins, 2016; Hvenegaard et al, 2020; Moeller et al., 2020;\nRoberts et al, 2021), psychotherapists have for decades attempted to\nreduce rumination, and thereby to improve the patient's condition (for a\nreview on techniques for improving rumination (see Querstret and\nCropley, 2013). Several psychological models of rumination have been\nintroduced. For example, the ‘impaired disengagement hypothesis’\nsuggests that attentional disengagement from negative self-referent in-\nformation is impaired, resulting in prolonged processing of this kind of\ninformation (Koster et al., 2011), while the ‘mood-as-input’ hypothesis\nconsiders negative mood to affect the individual's stop-rules for a given\ntask resulting in perseveration of this task (Meeten and Davey, 2011). In\ncontrast, other accounts underline the adaptive function of rumination\nfor complex problem solving (e.g. due to reduced distraction) (Andrews\nand Thomson, 2009; Whitmer and Gotlib, 2013).\n\nOn the basis of a comprehensive literature review, Rayner et al.\n(2016) demonstrated that two neurocognitive networks, namely the\nautobiographic memory network and the cognitive control network,\nwhich are correlated and anti-correlated with rumination, respectively,\nare central to several cognitive depressive symptoms (e.g. self-blame or\nindecisiveness); downstream effects of this imbalance on other networks\nprovide the link to affective and vegetative symptoms of depression\n(Rayner et al., 2016). Several neuroimaging studies showed a strong link\nbetween rumination and the DMN (Zhou et al., 2020). More specifically,\nwhile perseverative cognition generally involves brain structures like\nthe medial frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, insula, and posterior cingulate\ncortex, the involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex distinguished\npatients with mental disorders from healthy controls (Makovac et al.,\n2020). Other authors reported no role of the DMN as such, but found\nincreased connectivity of the subgenual prefrontal cortex with the DMN\n(Hamilton et al., 2015).\n\n1.3. Scope of this review\n\nIn contrast to the vast amount of studies which have investigated\nrumination in depression, only a few clinical studies, up to now, have\naddressed MW in general. Therefore, it is yet an open question whether\npatterns of MW are altered in depression and, if so, how these alterations\nare related to rumination. In particular, it is unclear whether the\n\n\nL. Chaieb et al.\n\npropensity to mind wander overall is greater in depression or whether\nonly rumination is increased. Moreover, it is still unknown if rumination\nemerges as an isolated phenomenon or from a general shift of MW\npatterns towards a ruminative nature. Furthermore, it is not yet un-\nderstood, what the emotional and physiological impact of rumination is\ncompared to that of commonplace MW. Here, we aim to contribute to\nanswering these and other questions by summarizing and discussing\navailable clinical studies on MW in depression, as well as on MW in\nclinically significant disorders accompanied by depressive symptoms.\n\n2. Literature search strategy\n\nLiterature research for this review was performed in accordance with\nthe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\nAnalyses (PRISMA) criteria. Searches were conducted using the elec-\ntronic databases PubMed and MEDLINE. The search terms and search\nlogic used were: (“mind wandering” OR mind-wandering OR mind-\nwandering) AND (depression OR depressive OR dysphoria OR dysphoric\nOR melancholia OR melancholy OR melancholic). In addition to the\nelectronic search strategy, the reference lists of the manuscripts that\nwere reviewed were examined to identify any additional articles not\ncaptured by the main search strategy. Analysis of the papers followed\nthe inclusion and exclusion criteria recommended by the PRISMA\nGuidelines. Manuscripts in English in the form of original articles, and\nclinical and experimental studies were considered. Exclusion criteria\n‘were case studies (case reports and case series) and non-original studies\nsuch as reviews, commentaries, letters to the editor etc. This initial\nsearch step yielded 39 articles. In a second search step, we identified the\narticles describing cohorts showing either a clinically significant\ndepression or with clinically significant disorders accompanied by\ndepressive symptoms. Full texts of all 39 articles were assessed against\nthese inclusion criteria. This second search step yielded the 13 articles,\n‘which are discussed in this review. Basic information on these studies is\nlisted chronologically in Table 1. Study summaries are grouped ac-\ncording to the implemented methodological approach.\n\n3. MW assessed by task-related experience sampling\n\n3.1. Watts and Sharrock (1985): description and measurement of\nconcentration problems in depressed patients\n\nIn a very early pioneering study, Watts and Sharrock (1985) sought\nto characterise lapses in concentration during the performance of\nroutine activities in depression patients recruited from across three\nhospitals. Such lapses in concentration are a frequent complaint in\ndepression patients and can negatively impact upon cognitive perfor-\nmance (Cheyne et al, 2006). Interestingly through clinical patient\ncontact, Watts and Sharrock (1985) had previously noted that depres-\nsion patients often reported that a loss of concentration was preceded by\n‘mind blanking’, i.e. the absence of thoughts, rather than MW. There-\nfore, the authors hypothesised that depressed patients may be more\nprone to lapses in concentration that are unassociated with MW, but are\nrather due to mind blanking. In addition, they aimed to examine\nmemory performance and its interrelation with deficits in concentration.\n\nPatients considered for the study completed the Levine-Pilowsky\nquestionnaire, which derives two depression scores for severity and\nendogeneity (Pilowsky and Boulton, 1970), to ascertain eligibility. 31\nsubjects were included and their mean severity of depression score was\n12.4, indicating moderate to severe depression (Pilowsky and Spalding,\n1972). The State form of the Spielberger Anxiety Questionnaire was also\nadministered to the patients, as well as the synonyms section of the Mill\nHill vocabulary test. Moreover, a structured interview was conducted\nwith each patient detailing their inability to concentrate, the extent to\nwhich their concentration was affected during different activities, and\nthe contributions of MW, mind blanking and external distraction. In a\nreading task, patients were instructed to read an excerpt from a book in\n\nNeuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 133 (2022) 104505\n\nsilence for 10 min, and to indicate to the experimenter if and when they\nlost concentration. The experimenter then asked whether their mind had\n‘wandered onto something else, with the answer ‘yes’ indicating MW and\n‘no’, indicating mind blanking. Finally, in a memory task, patients had to\nlisten to a passage from an audio book recording, and were then asked to\nfreely recall the content, as well as to answer 14 specific questions (cued\nrecall).\n\n‘This was the same in the case of the number of lapses in concentration\nexperimentally assessed during reading. However, partial correlations\nshowed that neither depression nor anxiety was significantly correlated\nwith concentration lapses, when the other was partialled out. The con-\ncentration lapses were also positively correlated with interview-based\nreading and television concentration problems, as well as negatively\ncorrelated with free and cued recall of details about the audio book\npassage. The percentage of MW-related lapses was significantly corre-\nlated only with depression endogeneity. On the other hand, depression\nseverity had its highest correlation with interview-based mind blanking,\n‘while state anxiety had its highest correlation with interview-based MW.\nMoreover, free recall was negatively correlated with depression severity\nand state anxiety. Regarding the distribution of MW versus blanking, the\ninterview revealed a significantly higher amount of MW, and the\nexperimental assessment during the reading task yielded 81 % of ‘yes’\nlapses (MW) versus 19 % of ‘no’ lapses (mind blanking).\n\n. Instead, thei\nfindings from the interview data and reading task point towards a major\nrole for MW in concentration deficits in depression. Watts and Sharrock\nacknowledge that the associations between MW/blanking and depres-\nsion versus anxiety cannot be unambiguously disentangled based on\ntheir data. Another obvious limitation is the absence of a healthy control\n\ngroup. Thus, it remains unclear whether the number of concentration\n\n3.2. Wats et al. (1988): associations between phenomenal and objective\naspects of concentration problems in depressed patients\n\nIn a follow-up study to Watts and Sharrock (1985); Watts et al.\n(1988) further investigated the distinction between “mind-wandering”\nand “blanking” lapses of concentration, again in a group of depression\npatients. In this later study, the authors hypothesise that these types of\nlapses in concentration have differential impacts on cognitive tasks.\nMore specifically, they supposed that MW would impair memory for\nprose, while mind blanking would hinder complex planning, as required\nin the ‘Tower of London’ task. Thirty-six patients diagnosed with uni-\npolar depression were recruited mostly from an acute in-patient unit.\nMean depression severity score, obtained by applying the\nLevine-Pilowsky depression questionnaire, was 12.7. Moreover, 24\ncontrol subjects matched for age, gender and education level were\nrecruited. Based on a self-report scale, lapses in concentration during\ndifferent activities were quantified in the patients for the following\ncategories: a) external distraction, b) MW, ) mind blanking (i.e. absence\nof thoughts), d) mind becomes “confused and jumbled”. Three different\nexperimental tasks were performed by the patients. In one, they silently\nread an excerpt from a text and indicated when they lost concentration\nand whether they were mind wandering or had experienced mind\nblanking, similar to the method described in Watts and Sharrock (1985).\nMoreover, memory for prose (an excerpt about a shopping centre) was\nprobed using ten questions in an ordinary condition (plain reading) and\n\n\n\nL.

Finally, patients were asked to\nperform the ‘Tower of London’ task, which requires one to move three\nbeads arranged on sticks of unequal length into a target position. The\ncontrol group only performed the ‘Tower of London’ task and did not\nparticipate in the text-based tasks.\n\nAs for major findings, the questionnaire data revealed that MW was a\nmore common concentration problem in the patient group than mind\nblanking or confusion (distraction data were excluded because of low\ninternal homogeneity). Correlations of the three types of concentration\nlapses with depression scores were not significant. The MW score was\npositively, and the mind blanking score negatively, correlated with the\nproportion of MW-related lapses during silent reading. For the “Tower of\nLondon” task, depressive subjects solved fewer problems during the 60's\ntest time and needed more time to arrive at a solution than controls.\nMW-related lapses during silent reading were not correlated with per-\nformance in the ‘Tower of London’ task, but were negatively correlated\n‘with memory for prose in the ordinary condition. On the contrary, mind\nblanking-related lapses were positively correlated with the planning\ntime taken in the ‘Tower of London’ task, but were not correlated with\nthe memory for prose.\n\nshortcoming is that the authors did not assess\nMW and blanking in control subjects, and thus could not compare their\noccurrence in patients versus controls. Moreover, the authors neglected\nto correlate experimentally measured MW and blanking frequencies\nduring silent reading with depression scores.\n\n3.3. Hoffmann et al. (2016): where the depressed mind wanders:\nself-generated thought patterns as assessed through experience sampling as\na state marker of depression\n\nIn this study self-generated thoughts (SGTs) during a simple\n\nattentional task were investigated in patients with depressive disorder\nand healthy controls. The authors recruited twenty-five patients (8\nmales) with a diagnosis of acute major depression (average BDI: 32.0,\nHAMD-21: 20.4), as well as twenty-six (10 males) age, education and\ngender-matched healthy subjects (average BDI: 2.5, HAMD-21: 0.77).\n‘The aims of the study were to monitor the amount, content and vari-\nability of SGTs. Based on cognitive models of depression and findings\nrelated to rumination and worry, the authors hypothesised that MDD\npatients would show a greater tendency to mind wander, i.e. to be less\n‘present’ during the task, and that their SGTs would be more negative, as\nwell as oriented toward the self and the past, compared to those of\nhealthy controls. Furthermore, MDD patients would think more often\nabout future events and show less variability and more rigid thought\npatterns compared to the control group (Hoffmann et al., 2016).\n\nTo investigate their hypotheses, Hoffmann et al. (2016), imple-\nmented a non-demanding choice reaction time task (CRT) which has\nbeen shown to allow for spontaneous SGTs. Frequent black and rare red\ndigits were presented and subjects had to respond to the red digits by\nindicating whether they were even or odd. At random time points,\nparticipants were asked what the content of their thoughts prior to the\nprobe was (number of thought probes were between 4 and 9). The au-\nthors assessed SGTs over seven different dimensions: 1) past-oriented, 2)\nfuture-oriented, 3) self-related, 4) other-related, 5) negatively valenced,\n6) positively valenced, and 7) how much off-task their thoughts were at\nthe time (i.e. MW), using a nine-point Likert scale. Variability of the\nanswers given was quantified by calculating fluctuations (squared suc-\ncessive differences) and extremity of the ratings (squared differences\nfrom the total sample mean). These data were then analysed mainly\nbased on linear mixed models.\n\n\nL. Chaieb et al.\n\nWith regard to variability, MDD patients showed no significant differ-\nences from controls for extremity and only a trend for less fluctuating\npast-related SGTs. Moreover, there were no differences in task perfor-\nmance of the CRT with regard to accuracy and reaction times.\n\nIn summary, the data reported by Hoffmann et al. (2016) indicate\nthat MDD patients compared to controls engage in more MW during task\nperformance. Most importantly, their SGTs exhibited patterns, which\npoint to a ruminative nature, i.e. their SGTs were less positive and more\nnegative, as well as more self- and past-related. Limitations of the study\nwere the low number of thought probes and that no measures of rumi-\nnation were acquired, which could corroborate the suggested link be-\ntween SGT patterns and rumination. A minor methodological\nshortcoming of the study is that the experience sampling procedure did\nnot comprise a “no-thought” option. Whenever subjects indicate that\ntheir thoughts are on-task, this makes it difficult to disentangle, whether\nsubjects are thinking about the task (i.e. MW) or whether they are\nactually focused on performing the task (i.e. absent MW).\n\n3.4. Hoffmann et al. (2018): evidence of depressogenic spontaneous\nthoughts and altered resting-state connectivity in adolescents with a\n‘maltreatment history\n\n‘The authors investigated spontaneous thoughts during an attentional\ntask in 29 adolescents (age: 12-16 years) with a maltreatment history\n(MT) and 39 healthy controls (Hoffmann ef al., 2018). Subjects in the\nMT group were recruited through a London Social Services Department\nand adoption agencies. Control subjects were matched for age, IQ,\nverbal fluency, pubertal status, level of education of parents, gender and\nethnicity. A choice reaction time task (CRT) with embedded thought\nprobes was used, similar to Hoffmann et al. (2016). Subjects were asked\nto rate how much 1) off-task, 2) other-related, 3) self-related, 4) nega-\ntively valenced, 5) positively valenced, 6) pastrelated, and 7)\nfuture-related their thoughts were on a nine-point Likert scale. Addi-\ntionally, they rated their current mood on two dimensions (positive,\nnegative). Moreover, all participants completed the Childhood Trauma\nQuestionnaire (CTQ; average values, MT: 31.6; controls: 27.9), the Child\nand Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI-4R; average depressive\nsymptoms, MT: 59.8; controls: 53.1; according to Gadow et al. (2013),\nimpairment cut-off for depressive disorders is 62) and the Wechsler\nAbbreviated Scales of Intelligence (WAST). Furthermore, functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were acquired during resting\nstate (490 s duration) using a 1.5 T scanner and functional connectivity,\nin terms of Pearson's correlations, was analyzed. The authors hypothe-\nsized an altered functional connectivity of the subgenual anterior cin-\ngulated cortex (sgACC) with other brain regions in the MT subjects, since\nthe sgACC has been implicated in behavioral withdrawal and negative\nself-reflective processes.\n\nThey\nhad fewer positive thoughts and larger deviations of ratings for posi-\ntively valenced thoughts from the norm (i.e. less positive rating values).\n\nOverall, depressive\nsymptoms (CASI-4R) were negatively correlated with ratings for posi-\ntively valenced thoughts, as well as with connectivity between and\nsgACC and cuneus. Moreover, group differences in depressive symptoms\nwere mediated by differences in sgACC-cuneus connectivity.\n\nTo sum up, the authors report reduced positive thoughts in subjects\nwith a maltreatment history, as well as reduced functional connectivity\nbetween the sgACC and regions of a fronto-parietal network involved in\ncognitive and attentional control. They interpret their findings as indi-\ncating that childhood abuse and neglect may lead to an internalization\n\nNeuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 133 (2022) 104505\n\nof negative self-referential schemas that bias information processing\naway from positive content. The authors speculate that a stronger\nconnection between sgACC and the fronto-parietal regions could facili-\ntate processes making rumination less likely, such as attentional shifts\nfrom internal default mode network processes to the outside environ-\nment. A limitation of the study is the relatively small differences be-\ntween the MT and control group regarding Childhood Trauma\nQuestionnaire and depressive symptoms (CASI-4R) ratings.\n\n4. MW assessed by resting state or everyday experience\nsampling\n\n4.1. Ottaviani et al. (2015): cognitive, behavioural, and autonomic\ncorrelates of MW and perseverative cognition in major depression\n\nIn this study the impact of different types of thoughts on mood and\ncardiac measures (heart rate and heart rate variability) was investigated\nusing an ecological experience sampling approach in depression patients\n(Ottaviani et al., 2015). Decline in heart rate variability is a trait-marker\nfor MDD (Brunoni et al., 2013; Udupa et al., 2007), and is associated\nwith an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (Thayer\netal, 2010). The authors differentiated between the following states: a)\nbeing on task, b) MW, c) perseverative thoughts (rumination or worry).\nOttaviani and colleagues hypothesized that perseverative thoughts have\na negative influence on mood and autonomic function, but not (non--\nperseverative) MW. According to this idea, MW turns into a risk factor\nfor health whenever it becomes rigid and inflexible.\n\nOttaviani et al. (2015) recruited a group of 18 MDD patients (12\nfemale; average BDI: 31.1) and compared them with a group of 18\ngender and education- matched healthy controls (11 female; average\nBDI 6.7). Age, however, was not properly matched between both groups\n(average age: MDD 38.4, controls 30.1 years). The design and imple-\nmentation of this current study was based on earlier findings regarding\nrepetitive and non-repetitive thoughts during an attentional task in\nhealthy subjects (Ottaviani et al., 2013), suggesting that perseverative\ncognition is associated with increased cognitive inflexibility, lower heart\nrate variability and decline in mood.\n\nPatients attended a clinical evaluation with a health care profes-\nsional who administered either the Structured Clinical Interview for\nDSM-IV (SCID) or the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview\n(MIND) to confirm a current MDD diagnosis. Eligible MDD patients and\ncontrols were then instructed on how to use a smart phone as an elec-\ntronic thought diary and were given an ambulatory heart rate device.\nOver the course of the next 24 h, all study participants had to respond to\nthought prompts approximately every 30 min. on the smart phone, to\ncomplete the diary. They were asked to report 1) contents of their cur-\nrent thought, including specifics (e.g. a problem, a past experience etc.);\n2) the duration of the thought; 3) if the thought was positive, negative or\nneutral; 4) whether the thought was repetitive; 5) temporal dimension\n(past, present, future); 6) whether it was interfering with their current\ntask; 7) how much they were trying to supress the thought; 8) annoying\nor disturbing events before; 9) factors that may affect heart rate (e.g.\ncaffeine, alcohol etc.); 10) current mood (tired, anxious, sad, happy,\nangry, bored) using a 5-point scale. Afterwards, for analysis purposes\nthoughts were re-coded as: being on task, MW, or perseverative thoughts\n(rumination or worry). In addition, raw heart rate was recorded as beat-\nto-beat intervals.\n\nAs major findings, the authors reported that MDD patients indeed\ncompared to controls.\n. Thus, the overall\n\ndecreased non-perseverative MW in the patient group.\n\namount of off-task thoughts did not differ between MDD patients and\ncontrols. Perseverative thoughts were always characterized by worse\nmood (i.e. less happy and more tired, anxious, sad, angry, bored)\ncompared to MW and being on task. Interestingly, mood during MW did\nnot differ from mood during on-task thoughts. Perseverative thoughts\n\n\n\nL. Chaieb et al.\n\nrequired more effort to be inhibited or supressed and interfered more\n‘with ongoing activities than MW. Moreover, they were associated with.\n. However,\nthere were no statistically significant differences to on-task thoughts.\nTo summarize, Ottaviani et al. (2015) reported that perseverative\nthoughts, but not off-task thoughts in general, are more common in MDD\npatients than in healthy controls. In both groups, perseverative\nthoughts, but not non-perseverative MW had a negative influence on\nmood. A methodological shortcoming of the study, similar Hoffmann\netal. (2016), is the absence of a no-thought category, and that thoughts\nabout the task at hand were interpreted as being focused on task per-\nformance, which is not necessarily the case.\n\n4.2. Rosenbaum et al. (2017): aberrant functional connectivity in\ndepression as an index of state and trait rumination\n\n‘This study investigated functional connectivity based on functional\nnear-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in depression patients and healthy\ncontrols. Near infrared spectroscopy is an optical imaging method which\nuses light in the near-infrared spectrum to measure changes in de-/\noxygenated haemoglobin concentration. 60 patients with a current\nmajor depression diagnosis and twenty-four healthy controls were\nrecruited into the study (Rosenbaum et al., 2017). Age between the two\ngroups was not properly matched (average age: MDD 40, controls 33\nyears). Diagnosis and assessment of symptom severity was based on the\nSCID, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Montgomer-\ny-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; average value patients: 21.1,\ncontrols: 1.4). Trait rumination was quantified using the Rumination\nResponse Scale (Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow, 1991). NIRS measure-\nments (52 channels) were undertaken during a 7-minutes resting period,\nin which participants were asked to sit still with eyes closed and simply\nlet their thoughts flow. Afterwards subjects documented their mental\nexperiences in addition to indicating the amount of time they spent with\ndifferent mental processes, on visual analogue scales. Four main cate-\ngories were analyzed (based on 10 items): state rumination, MW, fight\nagainst fatigue and focus on sensation. Functional connectivity was\nanalysed with network-based statistics comprising univariate testing\nand subsequent cluster-based permutation tests. The authors hypothe-\nsized that depression patients would report more trait and state rumi-\nnation and less MW than healthy controls, and that rumination would be\nanti-correlated with network connectivity strengths in parietal regions.\n\noreover,\nmedian-split analysis dividing patients into high versus low ruminators,\nagain, showed decreased functional connectivities in the depression-\nrelated network for high ruminators, with stronger effects for trait\nversus state rumination. On the contrary, a similar analysis revealed\nincreased functional connectivities in the depression-related network for\nhigh versus low mind-wanderers (see Rosenbaum et al., 2017, Supple-\nmentary material).\n\nThe authors suggest that their findings support the idea of a dis-\nrupted network organisation in major depression, which is closely\ncorrelated with state and trait rumination. Times spent in the states of\nMW versus rumination were found to be anti-correlated. Moreover, ef-\nfects of MW versus rumination on connectivity within the depression-\nrelated network appeared to be opposite, although this question has\n\nNeuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 133 (2022) 104505\n\nnot been investigated systematically. A limitation of the study is that\nthought processes were only assessed after the resting period, and not by\nusing a real-time experience sampling approach.\n\n4.3. Moukhtarian et al. (2020): wandering minds in\nattention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and borderline personality disorder\n\nIn this study, patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were investigated\n(Moukhtarian et al., 2020). Both disorders exhibit overlapping symp-\ntoms and are therefore difficult to disentangle in clinical practice. The\nauthors hypothesized that ADHD could possibly be distinguished from\nBPD based on the observation of excessive spontaneous MW. 28 ADHD\npatients, 19 BPD patients and 22 comorbid ADHD -+ BPD patients were\nrecruited from outpatient clinics in England, and 29 healthy controls\nwere recruited from the general public (all participants were female).\nAge and intelligence quotient were not exactly matched, but, according\nto the authors, did not have a significant effect in the analysis models.\nComorbid depression and anxiety was measured using the Brief Symp-\ntom Inventory (BSL: Derogatis, 1993). Self-reported spontaneous MW\nwas quantified using the Mind Excessively Wandering Scale (MEWS,\nMowlem et al., 2019). To experimentally assess MW, experience sam-\npling was carried out eight times daily with a smartphone application\n(MoodMapper), across five consecutive days. Frequency of occurrence,\nintensity and content of MW was assessed by seven questions, and\nexperience sampling data were analysed using multilevel models.\n\n‘The authors interpret their data as indicating that excessive MW is as\nmuch a part of BPD as ADHD. Thus, they reject their initial hypothesis\nthat both disorders can be disentangled by measuring the propensity to\nmind wander. However, the adjustments for anxiety and depression\nsuggest that MW in BDP probably reflects anxious and depressive ru-\nminations, whereas in ADHD, it reflects a core difficulty with sustaining\nattention. A limitation of this study is that anxiety and depression were\nquantified only with the brief symptom inventory, which is a rather\ngeneral indicator of psychopathology, and not with more specialised\nscreening tools.\n\n5. MW evaluated by self-report scales\n5.1. Greenberg et al. (2018): compassionate hearts protect against\n\nwandering minds: self-compassion moderates the effect of mind-wandering\non depression\n\nWhile MW is often linked to decreases in mood (Killingsworth and\nGilbert, 2010; Stawarczyk et al., 2013; Yamaoka and Yukawa, 2020),\nself-compassion has been shown to decrease depressive symptoms and\nincrease levels of resilience (Krieger et al., 2013; MacBeth and Gumley,\n2012; Van Dam et al, 2011). Self-compassion has been described as\nbeing open to and moved by one’s own suffering, experiencing feelings\nof caring and kindness toward oneself and taking an understanding,\nnonjudgmental attitude toward one’s inadequacies and failures” (Neff,\n2003). Despite the association between MW and self-compassion being\n\n\nL. Chaieb et al.\n\nplausible, there is sparse evidence to suggest that these factors interact\n\non any level to mediate depression and/ or depressive symptoms.\nGreenberg et al. (2018), aimed to explore this putative interaction,\n\nby recruiting patients undergoing treatment for depression, into a study\n\nto severe depressive symptoms, designated by a score of >11 (indicating\nat least a mild depression), on the 28-item Hamilton Scale (HAMD-28)\nwere recruited into the study. The patients were randomly assigned to\none of two groups: the first which will undergo MBCT, as well as\ncontinuing to adhere to a treatment plan, or the second- a group termed\nthe ‘treatment-as-usual’ (TAU) group, whereby patients would continue\nregular treatment, and who would later be offered MBCT after the study\nwas completed. Prior to the start of the study, participants underwent\nclinical evaluation using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric\nInterview (MINT) and HAMD-28, for eligibility as previously mentioned.\nIn addition, subjects were asked to complete the Self-Compassion Scale\n(SCS; Neff, 2003), which is a 26-item self-report scale. The SCS\ncomprised of six subscales specifying self-kindness, self-judgement,\ncommon humanity, isolation, mindfulness and over-identification. MW\nwas assessed using the Mind-Wandering Questionnaire (MWQ; Mrazek\net al, 2013a, b) and depression scores were recorded using the Beck\nDepression Inventory-II (BDI-IL; Beck et al., 1996), which was adminis-\ntered 0-2 weeks prior to the start of the study and then every 2-3 weeks\nduring the program. HAMD-28, SCS and MWQ were assessed before and\nafter the MBCT program. This comprised of eight weekly 2-h therapy\nsessions lead by trained MBCT teachers, and which combined elements\nof cognitive therapy, mindfulness training and experiential meditation\n\nHER\n82%\n[Et]\ngs\nSB\n2:8\nSEE\nEE]\n-\nHE\nEE\nBR\nS58\n2 F2\n82a\nSEB\ne933\n£88\nBEE\nBFE\n: 28\nFE2\ntig\nBig\nSy\naf s\n15\nPER\n898\nge\negg\n7E°\nRe)\na=\nnr\n\nIn summary, the findings by Greenberg et al. (2018) suggest that\nthere is indeed a complex interplay between feelings of self-compassion,\nMW and depression, and that training of self-compassion may help to\nprotect from the detrimental effects of MW in individuals exhibiting\ndepressive symptoms. Limitations of the study are the large number of\ndrop-outs (12 from 40 subjects withdrew prior to conclusion) resulting\nin small group sizes, and the lack of an active intervention for the control\ngroup.\n\n5.2. Soffer-Dudek and Somer (2018): trapped in a daydream: daily\nelevations in maladaptive daydreaming are associated with daily\npsychopathological symptoms\n\nDaydreaming is a kind of intense MW with fantastical dream-like\n\nNeuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 133 (2022) 104505\n\nqualities. Daydreaming disorder, more commonly referred to as mal-\nadaptive daydreaming, characterises a mental condition in which in-\ndividuals frequently engage in episodes of excessive and absorbing\ndaydreaming. This often leads to functional impairment, goal-neglect\nand in particular, heightened levels of negative emotion (Somer,\n2002). Maladaptive daydreaming, however, despite having a significant\nimpact on the functioning of a subject's daily life, is a unique construct\nthat has yet to be included in standard mental health diagnostic manuals\n(Somer et al, 2017).\n\nIn a longitudinal daily diary-based study, Soffer Dudek and Somer\n(2018) aimed to examine the preceding, co-occurring and subsequent\nsymptoms that accompany maladaptive daydreaming. These included,\nfor instance, changes in mood, dissociation, obsessive-compulsive\nsymptoms, and anxiety, so that the etiology of this complex disorder\nmay be better understood. The authors formulated a three-pronged\nhypothesis: (i) that individuals reporting an increase in maladaptive\ndaydreaming would also report an increase in other psychopathological\nsymptoms associated with this condition, such as dissociation (Somer,\n2002); (ii) that days where episodes of maladaptive daydreaming were\nmost frequent, would be characterised by a higher likelihood of in-\ndividuals reporting associated symptoms the following day; (iii) that\nmaladaptive daydreaming would be closely related to increased reports\nof both positive and negative affect, due to the rewarding-addictive\naspect of this condition on the one hand (which reinforces the behav-\nfour and explains its chronic development), and the later feelings of\ndisappointment and guilt, on the other (Soffer-Dudek and Somer, 2018).\nA group of seventy-seven individuals (82 % female), who were\nself-identified maladaptive daydreamers, were asked to complete a\nbattery of daily questionnaires which comprised of the Maladaptive\nDaydreaming Scale (MDS), the Clinician Administered Dissociative\nStates Scale (CADSS), the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory- Revised\n(OCI-R), the Beck's Cognitive Triad (BCT) for depression, a shortened\nversion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Mini- Social\nPhobia Inventory (Mini-SPIN) and the Positive and Negative Affect\nSchedule (PANAS). The diary-based data collection period lasted for 14\ndays, where participants recorded the daily levels of depression, general\nanxiety, social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms,\ndissociation, as well as positive and negative emotions using these\nscales. MW in the form of day dreaming was indirectly assessed using the\nDS.\n\nSoffer-Dudek and Somer (2018) observed that participants spent on\n\ng\n\nOverall, this study shows that maladaptive daydreaming increases\nnegative emotions and depression. However, this finding is somewhat\ncircular, since the authors investigated daydreaming in a cohort with\nmostly above-threshold maladaptive traits. Thus, a correlation with\n\n\nL. Chaieb et al.\n\nnegative symptoms is to be expected. Nevertheless, this study addressed\nhow a unique kind of excessive and absorbing MW is closely related to\ndepression.\n\n5.3. El Haj et al. (2019): off-track thoughts: intentional and\nunintentional MW in Alzheimer’s disease\n\nEl Haj and colleagues investigated MW and other cognitive charac-\nteristics in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and healthy controls\n(El Haj et al., 2019). Since AD is characterized by high rates of depres-\nsion, the authors hypothesized that AD patients may exhibit increased\nlevels of MW. 30 participants with a clinical diagnosis of probable mild\nAD and 33 controls matched for age, gender and educational level were\nrecruited. MW was assessed using the 8-item scale developed by Seli\netal. (20174, b, c), which differentiates between intentional and unin-\n\n8\n5\n3\ng\n3\nB\ng :\n|\n\nintentional and unintentional were significantly correlated\ndepression scores in AD patients (r = 0.50 and r = 0.51, respectively), as\nwell as in controls (r = 0.48 and r = 0.41, respectively). There was no\ncorrelation between MW with working memory scores. Moreover, a\nregression analysis yielded no significant contribution of MW to episodic\nmemory scores. A major limitation of this study is that only a self-report\nscale was used to measure MW, and that the contents of MW were not\nfurther explored.\n\n5.4. Takahashi et al. (2019): changes in depression and anxiety through\n‘mindfulness group therapy in Japan: the role of mindfulness and\nself-compassion as possible mediators\n\nTakahashi et al. (2019) investigated the effect of an 8-week mind-\nfulness program in 16 subjects with depression and/or anxiety symp-\ntoms. Participants were recruited using a website of the clinic at which\nthe study was based, and were evaluated based on the\nMini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The participants\nhad various diagnoses: in two participants a major depression, in one a\ndysthymia and in two others moderate suicidal tendencies. Moreover,\npanic disorder, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder were\ndiagnosed in four other subjects. The mindfulness program was\ncomprised of eight sessions of 2 h each, addressing\nmindfulness-meditation practice and related issues. Participants were\nasked to engage in a meditation practice each day for 45-60 min and to\nbe mindful of daily experiences. The following self-report scales were\nused: BDL-II (average score: 14.3 + 8.3), trait anxiety scale (State-Trait\nAnxiety Inventory: STAD, Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire\n(FFMQ), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Mind Wandering\nQuestionnaire (MWQ), Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), and the Behavioral\nInhibition/Activation Scales (BIS/BAS). These scales were completed at\nthe beginning and end of the mindfulness program, as well as 8 weeks\nlater which served as a follow-up.\n\nNeuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 133 (2022) 104505\n\nMWQ, BIS/BAS).\n\nimitations of the study are the small sample size, the wide-\nranging diagnoses and symptom levels, the sole reliance on self-report\nmeasures, and most importantly, the lack of a control condition,\nwhich logically excludes any causal attribution of the obtained changes\nto the intervention.\n\n5.5. Figueiredo et al. (2020): mind-wandering, depression, anxiety and\nADHD: disentangling the relationship\n\nIn a recent study, Figueiredo et al. (2020) examined the contributing\nrole of anxiety and depression to rates of MW in adolescents diagnosed\nwith attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and clinical con-\ntrols. Other studies have shown a high co-occurrence between the ADHD\nsymptoms of inattention and hyperactivity with MW (for reviews, see\nBozhilova et al, 2018; Lanier et al, 2019) and maladaptive day-\ndreaming (Somer et al., 2017). However, Figueiredo et al. (2020) sus-\npected that rather than MW being associated with ADHD, it is more\nlikely correlated with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, which\nfrequently co-occur with ADHD. In order to investigate their hypothesis,\nFigueiredo et al. (2020), administered a language adapted version of the\nMind Excessively Wandering Scale (MEWS; Mowlem et al., 2019) to\nmeasure levels of MW. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the\nScreen for Child Anxiety Related Emotion Disorders (SCARED) ques-\ntionnaire (Birmaher et al, 1999) and depressive symptoms were\nrecorded using the Child Depression Inventory (CDI, Kovacs, 1992).\nSeventy-eight participants were recruited into the study through a\nreferral by a health care professional and according to their diagnoses,\n‘were sorted into one of two groups. One group consisted of patients with\nlearning disabilities, depressive and/or anxiety symptoms, but without\nADHD - which was termed the clinical control group (N = 40). The\nsecond group of patients primarily consisted of subjects with an ADHD\ndiagnosis, both with and without comorbidities (N = 38).\n\nFirst, the authors performed a correlational analysis of MEWS scores,\nanxiety, depression, inattention scores (indicating ADHD), and de-\nmographic factors across all subjects.\n\nscores. Second, the authors performed a multiple linear regression\nanalysis showing that anxiety and inattention scores are the best pre-\ndictors of MW. Depression scores only slightly improved the prediction,\nmost likely due to their strong correlation with anxiety scores, and were\n\nalone not predictive for MW. Moreover, the authors found no differences\n\nTo summarize, this study shows that anxiety, depression and inat-\ntention symptoms are related to increased levels of MW. Moreover, these\nfindings suggest that MW is more closely related to anxiety than to\ndepression symptoms. However, it remains unclear why a strong cor-\nrelation of MW with inattention symptoms, but no association with\nclinically diagnosed ADHD was found, and the authors chose not to\nelaborate further on this conundrum.\n\n5.6. El Haj and Nandrino (2021): intentional and unintentional\n'mind-wandering in Korsakoff syndrome\n\nKorsakoff syndrome is characterised by a decline in episodic mem-\nory, general cognitive functioning and executive capabilities. Its main\n\n\nL. Chaieb et al.\n\ncauses are thiamine deficiency, malnutrition and prolonged alcoholism\n(Arts et al, 2017). In this study, the authors recruited 31 patients\ndiagnosed with Korsakoff syndrome and 33 healthy controls matched for\ngender, age and educational level (EI Haj and Nandrino, 2021). Similar\nto a previous study by EI Haj et al. (2019), MW was quantified using the\nscale developed by Seli et al. (20172, b, ¢), which differentiates between\nintentional and unintentional MW. Again, the following three cognitive\nvariables were evaluated: general cognitive functioning (Montreal\nCognitive Assessment, MOCA), working memory (forward and back-\nward digit span), and response conflict processing (Stroop task). Scores\nfor all three cognitive measures were significantly reduced in Korsakoff\npatients compared to controls. Moreover, depression was quantified\nusing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, similar to EI Haj et al.\n(2019). Depression scores were significantly higher in patients (average:\n6.90) compared to controls (average: 3.64) (according to Olsson et al.,\n2005, cut-off for MDD is 8).\n\ndepression in the control group. Possible reasons for this discrepancy\nwere not discussed further by the authors. Moreover, there were no\nsignificant correlations of MW scores with any of the cognitive mea-\nsures. Similar to the earlier study by EI Haj etal. (2019), the sole reliance\non a self-report scale to measure MW without further exploration its\ncontents, is a weakness of this study.\n\n6. Discussion\n\nIn this status report, we have described currently available studies on\nMW in clinical depression and disorders accompanied by depressive\nsymptoms. Interestingly, the topic of MW in clinical depression has been\naddressed by the older investigations (1985-2018), while MW in dis-\norders accompanied by depressive symptoms has been targeted in the\nmore recent studies (2018-2021). Overall, the methodological ap-\nproaches underlying these studies are very heterogeneous. Eleven of the\n13 studies that we have selected have used self-rating scales to measure\nMW, but only seven implemented experience sampling, and only four of\nthose used an attentional task. In three investigations additional func-\ntional measures were acquired.\n\nHere, our main aim has been to clearly and thoroughly describe the\nfew available studies, and thereby to provide researchers in the field\nwith a comprehensive overview of the status quo. Due to the heteroge-\nneity of the methods used and specific research questions, it is difficult\nto synthesize across these studies. In the following subsections, we will\ndiscuss several points for which, from our view, at least a partial syn-\nthesis has been feasible. The impossibility to extract more common in-\nsights based on these studies constitutes part of the problem we intended\nto point to. Importantly, we will highlight several conceptual, method-\nological and interpretational difficulties below. Although further\nresearch efforts are needed to solve all of these issues, to this aim, we\nhave listed some suggestions for future approaches in the summary. We\nhope that these suggestions, as well as awareness of the difficulties\nhighlighted, may contribute to enabling faster and steadier progress in\nthe field.\n\n6.1. Looking at the available studies, is there evidence to indicate that\ndepression is characterized by a larger overall amount of MW (including\nrumination)?\n\nMost of the investigations regarding clinical disorders accompanied\nby depressive symptoms point to this direction (Soffer-Dudek and\nSomer, 2018; El Haj et al., 2019; Figueiredo et al., 2020; Moukhtarian\net al,, 2020; El Haj and Nandrino, 2021). However, for the studies tar-\ngeting clinical depression, the picture is more divergent. The classic\n\nNeuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 133 (2022) 104505\n\nworks by Watts and Sharrock (1985) and Watts et al. (1988) did not\naddress this issue. Based on experience sampling during an attentional\ntask, Hoffmann et al. (2016) reported that depression patients do indeed\nhave more MW than controls, and that their thought patterns are more\ninclined towards a ruminative nature. Based on self-report scales,\nGreenberg et al. (2018) described that the interrelation between MW\npropensity and depression scores holds true only for patients with low\nself-compassion, but not for those exhibiting high self-compassion. On\nthe other hand, based on intraday experience sampling, Ottaviani et al.\n(2015) found significantly more perseverative thoughts (rumination\nplus worry), but a trend for less non-perseverative thoughts in patients\ncompared to controls. In this study, the amount of overall MW\n(including perseverative thoughts) was numerically even larger in the\ncontrol group. Similarly, based on experience sampling during resting\nstate, Rosenbaum et al. (2017) reported more rumination, but less MW\n(excluding rumination) for patients compared to control subjects. Again,\nthe amount of overall MW (including rumination) was numerically\nlarger in the controls. Thus, the question whether the amount of overall\nMW (including rumination) is related to depression remains an open\none. A possible reason for the divergent outcomes of the\nexperience-sampling based studies is that Hoffmann et al. (2016)\nmeasured MW during an attentional task, while Ottaviani et al. (2015)\nand Rosenbaum et al. (2017) applied the method in daily life and resting\nstate, respectively. Speculatively speaking, depressive patients may find\nit more difficult to withdraw attention from task-unrelated (persevera-\ntive) thoughts and attend to task performance than healthy controls.\n‘This idea is generally in line with findings by Smallwood et al. (2007)\nindicating that links between dysphoria (i.e. subclinical depressive\nsymptoms) and off-task thoughts tighten with task effort.\n\n6.2. Does rumination in depression emerge rather as an isolated\n‘phenomenon or is there a gradual transition from non-ruminative MW to\nrumination?\n\n‘The data reported by Hoffmann et al. (2016) point towards the latter\nidea. With regard to average characteristics, they found MW to be more\nnegative, past-oriented, self-related and less positive in MDD patients\ncompared to controls. Importantly, in the case of isolated ruminative\nthoughts larger fluctuations and extremity of these characteristics would\nbe expected in patients than controls. However, no significant differ-\nences were observed regarding fluctuations and extremity of the ratings,\nand even a trend for less fluctuating past-oriented MW in the patients\n‘was found. With the limitation of a quite low number of thought probes,\nthese data tentatively suggest that the patterns of MW overall shift to-\nwards a ruminative nature in depression.\n\nPlease note, that we have regarded rumination as a subtype of MW\n‘within the remit of this review, deriving from a very broad definition of\nMW (i.e. “production of thoughts or images which are unrelated to our\nexternal surroundings and the task at hand”, see Introduction). Several\nother equally valid categorizations of MW have been proposed, which\n‘were suggested to contribute to a family-resemblance view (Seli et al.,\n2018). Depending on the specific definition of MW, rumination may\nalternatively be seen as overlapping with or distinct from MW. For\ninstance, MW has been categorized as a spontaneous thought process\naccording to an influential framework (Christoff et al., 2016; Fox et al.,\n2018). This view is based on the notion that both deliberate and auto-\nmatic constraints on the contents of commonplace MW are relatively\nlow. In contrast, automatic constraints appear to be high in case of\nrumination resulting in an excessive stability in thought content.\nConsequently, rumination has to be considered as a phenomenon\ndistinct from MW based on this categorization. Importantly, we do not\nintend to pick sides regarding the conceptual framing of MW and\nrumination, which from our view does not affect the conclusions of this\nstatus report. From a pragmatic perspective, it is important that in-\nvestigators clearly state how MW and rumination have been assessed\nand what the reported measures comprise of (for instance, overall MW\n\n\nL. Chaieb et al.\nincluding rumination or commonplace MW excluding rumination).\n\n6.3. What is the emotional and physiological impact of rumination\ncompared to commonplace MW?\n\nThe studies by Ottaviani et al. (2015) and Rosenbaum et al. (2017)\nshed some light on this question. Ottaviani et al. (2015) reported that\nperseverative thoughts (rumination plus worry) were characterized by\nworse mood (less happy; more tired, anxious, sad, angry, bored) than\nMW. They required more effort to be inhibited or suppressed, interfered\nmore with ongoing activities and were associated with lower heart rate\nvariability. Moreover, based on NIRS measurements, Rosenbaum et al.\n(2017) reported opposite effects of rumination versus MW on functional\nconnectivity within a depression-related network, with decreased con-\nnectivities for high versus low ruminators, but increased connectivities\nfor high versus low MW. As to be expected, these data indicate multiple\nnegative consequences of rumination versus commonplace MW. How-\never, further investigations differentially assessing both rumination and\nMW are needed to reveal a more detailed picture and to corroborate\nthese initial findings.\n\nA related, more general issue is the temporal and causal relation\nbetween MW and negative mood: does negative mood follow MW or vice\nversa? Evidence for temporal dependencies in both directions has been\nreported. Based on daily-life experience sampling in a large population,\nKillingsworth and Gilbert (2010) observed that decreases in mood fol-\nlowed increased MW. Poerio et al. (2013) reported also based on\ndaily-life experience sampling in a smaller population, that MW only\npredicted feeling worse if its content was negative. Moreover, Ruby etal.\n(2013a, b) found that not only negative thoughts were associated with\nsubsequent negative mood, but also past- and other-related thoughts,\neven when thought content was positive. On the other hand, based on\nexperimental induction of negative moods increased MW propensities\n(Smallwood et al., 2009) have been observed. Moreover, after negative\nmood induction increases of past-oriented MW were detected and de-\ncreases of present-oriented MW were correlated with depression scores\n(Smallwood and O'Connor, 2011). Hence, there is evidence for temporal\ndependencies between MW and negative mood in both directions. This\nbi-directionality may constitute a vicious circle, which may contribute\nto the development of depressive disorder. Regarding rumination, it has\nbeen suggested that a ruminative processing style interacts with\ndysphoric mood (Smallwood et al., 2003). In the absence of dysphoria,\nrumination was found to be associated with high levels of task focus.\nHowever, while in the presence of dysphoria, it was associated with a\npre-occupation with one’s own task performance. In short, the causal\ninteraction and temporal relation between MW/rumination and nega-\ntive mood/depression is still under exploration.\n\n6.4. Methodological considerations\n\n‘The studies described in this review used a wide variety of different\napproaches to measure MW. The methodologies ranged from self-rating\nscales to experience sampling during daily life and in laboratory settings\nwith or without attentional tasks. Other investigations found only\nmodest correspondence between these different methodologies. The\nMW questionnaire (Mrazek et al, 2013a, b), for instance, yielded\nmoderate intra-subject correlations in the range between 0.23 and 0.42\n‘with experience sampling during daily life (Ostojic-Aitkens et al., 2019),\nduring reading (Mrazek et al., 2013a, b) and during the SART (Kawagoe\net al, 2020; Krakau et al., 2020). A recent study compared both expe-\nrience sampling during daily life and during attentional /cognitive lab-\noratory tasks (Linz et al, 2021). Moderate to strong intra-subject\ncorrelations in the range between 0.25 and 0.53 were observed for\ndifferent aspects of thought content (emotional valence, self-relatedness,\ntemporal orientation). However, for MW propensity a complete absence\nof a correlation was reported (r = —0.02) and other studies found only\nweak associations (e.g. Kane et al., 2017). Comparing off-task thoughts\n\n1\n\nNeuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 133 (2022) 104505\n\nin laboratory and daily life contexts, Ho et al. (2020) found broad sim-\nilarities of thought patterns, but also apparent differences. For instance,\noff-task laboratory thoughts were more social and occurred more\nspontaneously. This shows that MW assessments using different meth-\nodologies do not necessarily have to converge towards the same\nconclusion. Importantly, differences in MW between patients and con-\ntrol subjects may depend considerably on the situation or setting. For\ninstance, a laboratory setting may induce more stress, and consequently\nmore MW, in depression patients than in healthy subjects. Moreover,\npatients may be more inclined to provide the responses they interpret to\nbe desired by the experimenter than controls (Weinstein, 2018).\nFurthermore, levels and contents of MW may be differentially modu-\nlated by attentional tasks in patients versus control participants.\n‘Therefore, much more work is needed to understand these potential\nbiases and moderators of clinical MW data.\n\nClosely related to these considerations are the issues of task\ncomplexity and task context, such as place and situation (Smallwood\net al., 2021). For instance, while patterns of thought content have been\nfound to vary depending on task and context, unpleasant intrusive\nthoughts were correlated with depression scores across tasks and con-\ntexts (e.g. Konu et al., 2021). Regarding MW propensity, often increased\nMW has been reported during performance of easier compared to more\ndifficult tasks (Forster and Lavie, 2009; McKiernan et al., 2006; Turnbull\netal, 2019). However, opposite effects have also been observed, such as\nreduced MW being reported during the reading of easy, versus difficult\ntexts (e.g. Feng et al., 2013). Regarding task context, it has been found,\nfor instance, that mind wandering increased during the course of a\npre-recorded lecture in video-format, but did not during a live perfor-\nmance of the same lecture (Wammes and Smilek, 2017). Another study\nreported that when listening to an audiobook in a controlled laboratory\ncompared to a natural setting, distraction rates were higher than MW\nrates outside the lab, but not inside (Varao-Sousa et al., 2018). In short,\nthere is still an ongoing discussion as to which tasks and task contexts\nare most suitable to understand the relation between MW and depres-\nsion. Ideally, studies may choose to implement more than a single task,\ntask condition or task context, and/or complementary methodologies\n(questionnaire, daily-life experience sampling, task-based experience\nsampling).\n\n6.5. Meta-awareness and intentionality\n\nImportant and yet underinvestigated aspects of MW are whether it is\nintentional or unintentional (Giambra, 1995), and whether it is\naccompanied by meta-awareness or not (Schooler, 2002). Both aspects\nare interrelated (Seli et al., 2017): at least at the onset, intentional MW\nis supposed to more often be paralleled with meta-awareness than un-\nintentional MW (Smallwood, 2013). Since the validity of MW reports\ndepends on meta-awareness (Zedelius et al., 2015), it is important to\nmonitor meta-awareness in order to exclude a potential bias in MW\npropensities. Hereby, the sampled meta-awareness during MW is\nthought to correlate with the level of meta-awareness after appearance\nof the MW prompt. However, none of the studies described here\nmeasured meta-awareness. The studies by Greenberg et al. (2018) and\nTakahashi et al. (2019) indirectly addressed this issue by investigating\nthe impact of mindfulness-based training in depression patients. The\ncentral tenet of mindfulness is to focus one’s full attention on what is\nexperienced in the present moment. Since the present experience in-\ncludes the contents of MW, meta-awareness of MW is essential for\nmindfulness practice (Dunne et al., 2019). The findings by Greenberg\netal. (2018) and Takahashi et al. (2019) suggest that mindfulness-based\ntraining is able to alleviate depressive symptoms. However, a concom-\ntant reduction of MW scores was only observed by Greenberg et al.\n(2018). Such a decrease of MW due to mindfulness training is in line\nwith findings in healthy subjects (e.g. Mrazek et al., 2012, 2013a; Rahl\net al., 2017). Since meta-awareness is most likely a key mediator of the\nimpact of mindfulness on MW and rumination, it would be important to\n\n\nL. Chaieb et al.\n\n‘measure this aspect in future studies.\n\n‘The content of MW episodes has been shown to differ depending on\n‘whether MW is intentional or unintentional. Intentional MW was found\nto be rated as more future-oriented and as less vague than unintentional\nMW (Seli et al, 2017b). Since depression patients are often over-\nwhelmed by past-oriented ruminations (Hamlat et al., 2015), one may\nnaively expect depressive symptoms to be specifically associated with\nunintentional MW. However, findings up to now do not support this\nhypothesis. In healthy subjects, correlations of intentional, but not un-\nintentional MW with negative mood (Robison et al., 2020), and of both,\nintentional and unintentional MW with BDI scores (Nayda and Takar-\nangi, 2021) have been reported. The studies by El Haj et al. (2019) and\nEl Haj and Nandrino (2021), measured intentional versus unintentional\nMW based on self-report questionnaires in Alzheimer’s and Korsakoff\npatients. In line with Nayda and Takarangi (2021), both studies found\nsimilar correlations of intentional and unintentional MW with depres-\nsion scores. However, data on intentional versus unintentional MW in\ndepression patients are needed, before any firm conclusions can be\ndrawn.\n\n7. Summary\n\nTo summarize, the clinical studies described in this review represent\na first step in the investigation of MW in depression. Given the domi-\nnance of cognitive approaches in psychological research and psycho-\ntherapeutic treatment of depression it is surprising how little research\nhas been done on mind wandering in relation to this disorder. The\nstudies yield tentative insights into major issues, for instance, whether\nthe propensity to MW overall is increased in depression or not, and\nwhether rumination emerges as an isolated phenomenon or from a\ngeneral shift of MW patterns towards a ruminative nature. Much more\nwork is required to provide robust answers to these and other open\nquestions. In particular, further studies are necessary, which: i) compare\npatients with a primary diagnosis of major depression with healthy and\nappropriately matched controls, ii) implement measures of both MW\nand rumination, iii) are based on experience sampling (in combination\nwith other key approaches), iv) compare experience sampling during\ndaily life, resting state and attentional tasks, v) explore possible biases in\nthe assessment of MW, vi) acquire data not only related to the propensity\nand contents of MW, but also regarding meta-awareness and\nintentionality.\n\nFunding statement\n\n‘This work was not supported by any funding source.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\n\n‘The authors report no declarations of interest.\nAppendix A\n\nAbbreviations\nAD: Alzheimer’s disease\n\nADHD: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\nBCT: Beck's Cognitive Triad\n\nBDI: Beck Depression Inventory\n\nBIS/BAS: behavioral inhibition/activation scales\nBPD: borderline personality disorder\n\nBSI: Brief Symptom Inventory\n\nCADSS: Administered Dissociative States Scale\nCASI-4R: Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory\nCBT: cognitive behaviour therapy\n\nCDI: Childhood Depression Inventory\n\nCRT: choice reaction time task\n\nCTQ: Childhood Trauma Questionnaire\n\n12\n\nNeuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 133 (2022) 104505\n\nDMN: default mode network\n\nFFMQ: Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire\n\nfMRI: functional magnetic resonance imaging\nNIRS: functional near-infrared spectroscopy\n\nHAMD: Hamilton Depression Scale\n\nMAAS: Mindful Attention Awareness Scale\n\nMADRS: Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale\nMBCT: Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy\n\nMDD: major depressive disorder\n\nMDS: Maladaptive Daydreaming Scale\n\nMEWS: mind excessively wandering scale\n\nMINI: Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview\nMOCA: Montreal Cognitive Assessment\n\nMT: maltreatment history\n\nMTL: medial temporal lobe\n\nMW: mind wandering\n\nMWQ: Mind-Wandering Questionnaire\n\nMini-SPIN: Mini- Social Phobia Inventory\n\nOCD: obsessive compulsive disorder\n\nOCI-R: Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory- Revised\nPANAS: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule\nPHQ-9: Patient Health Questionnaire\n\nSCARED: Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotion Disorders\nSCID: Structured Clinical Interview (DSM-IV)\n\nSCS: self-compassion scale\n\n5gACC: subgenual anterior cingulated cortex\n\nSGTs: self-generated thoughts\n\nSTAI State-Trait Anxiety Inventory\n\nTAU: treatment-as-usual group\n\nWAS: Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence\n\nReferences\n\nAndrews, P.W., Thomson, J.A., 2009.
