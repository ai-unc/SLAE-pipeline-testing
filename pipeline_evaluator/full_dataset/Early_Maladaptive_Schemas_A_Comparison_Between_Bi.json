A vast amount\nof research point to essential differences between the two\nmood disorders, now termed bipolar disorder (BD) and\n‘major depressive disorder (MDD), including different ages\nof ‘onset, depressive symptomatology and medication\nresponses (Goodwin & Jameson, 2007). However, evidence\npointing to genetic co-heritability between the two disor-\nders (Kendler ef al., 2013) and one-third of MDD patients\nconverting into BD patients (Dudek ef al., 2013) indicate\nnebulous boundaries and an area in need of further\nelucidation.\n\n“Correspondence to: Kristine Kahr Nilsson, Center for Developmental\nand Applied Psychological Science (CeDAPS), the Department of\nCommunication and Psychology, Aalborg University, Denmark.\nE-mail: kkn@hum.aau.dk\n\nCopyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\ncauses and potential treatment implications.

Abnormalities\nin self-evaluation are, however, not confined to mood\nepisodes but also manifest during remitted illness phases\nof MDD and BD as evinced by lower self-esteem (Nilsson\net al,, 2010b) and higher self-compartmentalization (Alatiq,\nCrane, Williams, & Goodwin, 2010; Taylor, Morley, & Bar-\nton, 2007). Yet, little is known about the specific themes\nand patterns of self-conception in mood disorders during\nremission. The schema theory developed by Young, Klosko\nand Weishaar (2003), which contains an operationalized\nmodel of self-conceptual themes associated with psychopa-\nthology and dysfunction, provides a heuristic framework\nfor examining differences between MDD and BD in this\ndomain. The key concept within this theory is the early\nmaladaptive schema (EMS) defined as a broad, pervasive\ntheme or pattern comprised of memories, emotions, cognitions\nand bodily sensations regarding oneself and one's relationship with\nothers developed during childhood or adolescence elaborated\nthroughout one’s lifetime and dysfunctional to a significant degree\n(Young et al., 2003, p. 7). In cognitive models of psychopa-\nthology, schemas are considered the deepest level of\n\n\n388\n\nK. K. Nilsson et al.\n\ncognition, which consists of templates for information pro-\ncessing that guide thinking and behaviours (Wright, 2006).\nEMSs refer to schemas with early developmental origins\nwhich are highly self-perpetuating and maladaptive hence\ncausing considerable distress and dysfunction.\n\nIn earlier cognitive theories of mood disorders, negative\nself-schemas were conceptualized as latent cognitive struc-\ntures which needed to be primed by mood or triggered by\nparticular life events in order to be activated (Ingram,\nMiranda, & Segal, 1998; Kovacs & Beck, 1978). In the\nschema theory, on the other hand, EMSs are conceptualized\nas pervasive, ego-syntonic and highly accessible (Rafaeli,\nBernstein, & Young, 2011; Young ef al., 2003) and therefore\ndo not require stress-activation or priming in order to be\naccessed and measured. Due to these characteristics,\nEMSs appear relevant to consider as persistent patterns\ninfluencing the remitted illness phases of BD and MDD.\n\nThus far, research into EMSs in mood disorders is\nlimited. The few studies on the topic indicate that EMSs\noverall are more severe in mood disorder patients\ncompared with controls (Ak et al,, 2012; Halvorsen, Wang,\nEisemann, & Waterloo, 2010; Hawke & Provencher, 2012;\nNilsson ef al., 2010a). In the only study comparing BD\nand MDD in terms of EMSs, Hawke and Provencher\n(2012) found that, compared with MDD patients, BD\npatients had significantly higher scores on two EMSs:\nentitlement and approval seeking. This study points EMS\ndifferences between the two mood disorders. However,\nsince remission was not an inclusion criterion, the findings\n\ndo not extrapolate to remitted illness phases of the two\nmood disorders. Since mood symptoms can influence\nmeasurement, it is important to account for the effects of\nmood such as by using a remission design in which remission\nis an inclusion criterion. Thus, to elucidate this topic, the\npresent study employed a remission design that compared\nBD and MDD in terms of EMSs during remission.\n\nMETHODS\nSample\n\nThe sample consisted of two mood disorder cohorts which\nhave been used for other research purposes in previously\npublished studies (Halvorsen ef al., 2009; Halvorsen ef al.,\n2010; Nilsson, 2012; Nilsson ef al., 2010a). The inclusion\ncriteria were a diagnosis of either MDD or BD and current\nremission defined as the absence of major affective episodes\nestablished by clinical interviews. The procedures and mea-\nsures are described in earlier publications (Halvorsen et al.,\n2009; Halvorsen ef al., 2010; Nilsson, 2012; Nilsson ef al.,\n2010a). The participants with MDD were furthermore\nrequired to have at least two past depressive episodes\nin order to match the minimum number of affective\nepisodes required for a diagnosis of BD according to\nthe diagnostic criteria of ICD-10 (WHO, 1993).\n\nThe data were collected in two sites in Scandinavia: The\nUniversity Clinic at the University of Tromss, Norway,\n\nTable 1.

The merged sample consisted of 30\nparticipants with MDD and 49 participants with BD.\n\nMeasure\n\nThe short version of the Young Schema Questionnaire\n(YSQ-S2; Young, 1998) was used to measure 15 different\nEMSs outlined in Table 1. The YSQ-S2 is a self-report\nquestionnaire which requests the respondents to rate 75\nstatements on a Likert Scale ranging from 1= ‘completely\nuntrue of me’ to 6= \"describes me perfectly’. The psycho-\nmetric properties of the YSQ-S2 have been supported in\nprior research in terms of internal consistency, factor struc-\nture and convergent validity (e.g, Calvete, Estévez, Lopez\nde Arroyabe, & Ruiz, 2005; Hoffart et al., 2005; Welburn\net al., 2002). The schema domains, which describe catego-\nries of EMSs defined by their developmental origins\n(Young et al., 2003), were not analysed as higher order\ndimensions due to inconsistent support of their factorial\nvalidity (Calvete ef al., 2005; Hoffart et al., 2005; Levente\net al., 2012).\n\nData Analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using the Statistical\nPackage for the Social Sciences—Version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc.,\nChicago, USA). To examine between-group differences,\nt-tests were used for continuous variables and chi-square\nanalyses for categorical variables. Estimates of the\nsubscales’ internal consistencies were assessed through\nCronbach's alpha coefficients.\n\nRESULTS\n\nDescriptive and inferential statistics are presented in\nTable 2.

Nilsson et al.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe present study compared EMSs between BD and MDD\nduring remission. The results revealed that the BD group\nscored higher than the MDD group on most of the EMS\nscales, and for seven EMSs, the differences were statistically\nsignificant: abandonment, failure to achieve, insufficient\nself-control, subjugation, unrelenting standards, enmesh-\nment and entitlement. These findings extends previous\nfindings by Hawke and Provencher (2012) by suggesting\nthat EMSs also tend to be more severe in BD compared with\nMDD during remission.\n\nThe findings may be interpreted through a schema\ntheory lens. According to Young et al. (2003), temperamental\ndispositions interact with need-thwarting or traumatic early\nlife experiences in the formation of EMSs. Studies suggest\nthat BD, compared with MDD, is associated with more\nchildhood traumas (Hyun, Friedman, & Dunner, 2000) and\ntemperamental dysregulation (Matsumoto et al., 2005;\nNowakowska ef al, 2005; Savitz, van der Merwe, &\nRamesar, 2008). Thus, a higher prevalence of the pro-\nposed origins of EMSs in BD may explain the greater\nEMS severity in this disorder compared with MDD.\nMoreover, since EMSs purportedly continue their forma-\ntions in adulthood (Young ef al., 2003), the illness course\nof mood disorder may be assumed to play a role in their\nformation. Compared with MDD, BD is characterized\nby more frequent depressive episodes (Forty et al., 2008),\nmore comorbid anxiety disorders and personality disor-\nders (Moreno et al., 2012) and an earlier illness onset\n(Tondo, Lepri, Cruz, & Baldessarini, 2010; Weissman\net al., 1996). A more pervasive illness course in BD may\nbe conceived as having detrimental effects that contribute\nto the higher EMS severity in this group compared with\nMDD.\n\nThe findings may be considered in terms of their clinical\nimplications. Schema therapy (ST; Young et al., 2003), a\npsychotherapeutic treatment which specifically targets\nEMSs, has been found to have comparable efficacy with\ncognitive behaviour therapy in the treatment of MDD\n(Carter et al., 2013). Considering the higher EMS severity\nin BD compared with MDD, as indicated by the present\nstudy, it is pertinent to contemplate whether ST would\nhave additional treatment effects if applied to BD. Hawke,\nProvenche, and Parikhb (2013) have proposed a modified\nversion of ST for BD which emphasizes mood stabilization\nand prevention of affective relapses and recurrences. Thus,\nthe effects of ST tailored the symptomatology of BD seem\nrelevant to investigate in future treatments studies.\n\nA number of methodological drawbacks need to be con-\nsidered when interpreting the findings. First, as described\nelsewhere (Halvorsen e al., 2009; Halvorsen et al., 2010;\nNilsson, 2012; Nilsson ef al., 2010a), the assessment proce-\ndures used at two data-collection sites differed with regard\nto specific symptom measures and initial recruitment\n\nCopyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\nstrategies. The present findings should therefore be consid-\nered provisional and in need of further replication. Second,\ndue to the cross-sectional design, the present study did not\nprovide any insights into causal mechanisms underlying\nEMSs in the two mood disorders. The development of\nEMSs in mood disorders therefore remains to be eluci-\ndated by longitudinal research.\n\nIn conclusion, by suggesting that EMSs overall are more\nsevere in BD compared with MDD during remission, the\nfindings elaborate the understanding of differences be-\ntween the two mood disorders. Moreover, the findings\nhighlight potential vulnerabilities in BD, which merit\nfurther investigation in terms of their underlying causes\nand potential treatment implications.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nThe authors do not have any commercial association\nwhich might pose a conflict of interest in connection with\nthe manuscript.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThis study was partially made possible through funding\ngranted to the first author from Aarhus University, Denmark.\nAnother part of this study was supported by the National\nProgram of Integrated Clinical Specialists and PhD training\nfor Psychologist in Norway and the Psychiatric Research\nCentre of Northern Norway.
