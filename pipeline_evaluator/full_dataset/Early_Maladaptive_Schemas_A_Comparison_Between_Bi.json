A vast amountof research point to essential differences between the twomood disorders, now termed bipolar disorder (BD) andmajor depressive disorder (MDD), including different agesof onset, depressive symptomatology and medicationresponses (Goodwin & Jameson, 2007). However, evidencepointing to genetic co-heritability between the two disor-ders (Kendler et al., 2013) and one-third of MDD patientsconverting into BD patients (Dudek et al., 2013) indicatenebulous boundaries and an area in need of furtherelucidation.A hallmark of mood disorders is abnormal self-evaluationas manifested by in \ufb02ated and de \ufb02ated perceptions of selfduring mania and depression, respectively. Abnormalitiesin self-evaluation are, however, not con \ufb01ned to moodepisodes but also manifest during remitted illness phasesof MDD and BD as evinced by lower self-esteem (Nilssonet al., 2010b) and higher self-compartmentalization (Alatiq,Crane, Williams, & Goodwin, 2010; Taylor, Morley, & Bar-ton, 2007). Yet, little is known about the speci \ufb01ct h e m e sand patterns of self-conception in mood disorders duringremission. The schema theory developed by Young, Kloskoand Weishaar (2003), which contains an operationalizedmodel of self-conceptual themes associated with psychopa-thology and dysfunction, provides a heuristic frameworkfor examining differences between MDD and BD in thisdomain. The key concept within this theory is the earlymaladaptive schema (EMS) de \ufb01ned as a broad, pervasivetheme or pattern comprised of memories, emotions, cognitionsand bodily sensations regarding oneself and one \u2019s relationship withothers developed during childhood or adolescence elaboratedthroughout one \u2019s lifetime and dysfunctional to a signi \ufb01cant degree(Young et al., 2003, p. 7). In cognitive models of psychopa-thology, schemas are considered the deepest level of*Correspondence to: Kristine Kahr Nilsson, Center for Developmentaland Applied Psychological Science (CeDAPS), the Department ofCommunication and Psychology, Aalborg University, Denmark.E-mail: kkn@hum.aau.dkClinical Psychology and PsychotherapyClin.

In theschema theory, on the other hand, EMSs are conceptualizedas pervasive, ego-syntonic and highly accessible (Rafaeli,Bernstein, & Young, 2011; Young et al., 2003) and thereforedo not require stress-activation or priming in order to beaccessed and measured. Due to these characteristics,EMSs appear relevant to consider as persistent patternsin\ufb02uencing the remitted illness phases of BD and MDD.Thus far, research into EMSs in mood disorders islimited. The few studies on the topic indicate that EMSsoverall are more severe in mood disorder patientscompared with controls (Ak et al., 2012; Halvorsen, Wang,Eisemann, & Waterloo, 2010; Hawke & Provencher, 2012;Nilsson et al., 2010a). In the only study comparing BDand MDD in terms of EMSs, Hawke and Provencher(2012) found that, compared with MDD patients, BDpatients had signi \ufb01cantly higher scores on two EMSs:entitlement and approval seeking. This study points EMSdifferences between the two mood disorders. However,since remission was not an inclusion criterion, the \ufb01ndingsdo not extrapolate to remitted illness phases of the twomood disorders. Since mood symptoms can in \ufb02uencemeasurement, it is important to account for the effects ofmood such as by using a remission design in which remissionis an inclusion criterion. Thus, to elucidate this topic, thepresent study employed a remission design that comparedBD and MDD in terms of EMSs during remission.METHODSSampleThe sample consisted of two mood disorder cohorts whichhave been used for other research purposes in previouslypublished studies (Halvorsen et al., 2009; Halvorsen et al.,2010; Nilsson, 2012; Nilsson et al., 2010a). The inclusioncriteria were a diagnosis of either MDD or BD and currentremission de \ufb01ned as the absence of major affective episodesestablished by clinical interviews. The procedures and mea-sures are described in earlier publications (Halvorsen et al.,2009; Halvorsen et al., 2010; Nilsson, 2012; Nilsson et al.,2010a). The participants with MDD were furthermorerequired to have at least two past depressive episodesin order to match the minimum number of affectiveepisodes required for a diagnosis of BD according tothe diagnostic criteria of ICD-10 (WHO, 1993).The data were collected in two sites in Scandinavia: TheUniversity Clinic at the University of Troms\u00f8, Norway,Table 1.

The merged sample consisted of 30participants with MDD and 49 participants with BD.MeasureThe short version of the Young Schema Questionnaire(YSQ-S2; Young, 1998) was used to measure 15 differentEMSs outlined in Table 1. The YSQ-S2 is a self-reportquestionnaire which requests the respondents to rate 75statements on a Likert Scale ranging from 1 = \u2018completelyuntrue of me \u2019to 6 = \u2018describes me perfectly \u2019. The psycho-metric properties of the YSQ-S2 have been supported inprior research in terms of internal consistency, factor struc-ture and convergent validity (e.g., Calvete, Est\u00e9vez, L\u00f3pezde Arroyabe, & Ruiz, 2005; Hoffart et al., 2005; Welburnet al., 2002). The schema domains, which describe catego-ries of EMSs de \ufb01ned by their developmental origins(Young et al., 2003), were not analysed as higher orderdimensions due to inconsistent support of their factorialvalidity (Calvete et al., 2005; Hoffart et al., 2005; Leventeet al., 2012).Data AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed using the StatisticalPackage for the Social Sciences \u2014Version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc.,Chicago, USA). To examine between-group differences,t-tests were used for continuous variables and chi-squareanalyses for categorical variables. Estimates of thesubscales \u2019internal consistencies were assessed throughCronbach \u2019s alpha coef \ufb01cients.RESULTSDescriptive and inferential statistics are presented inTable 2. The percentage of women was signi \ufb01cantly higherin the MDD group compared with the BD group. However,the only EMS in which a sex difference emerged was entitle-ment with men scoring signi \ufb01cantly higher than women(t=2 . 8 7 , p= 0.005). The use of psychopharmacologicaltreatments was signi \ufb01cantly more prevalent in the BDgroup compared with the MDD group. Within the MDDgroup, there were no signi \ufb01cant differences in EMS scoresbetween participants who received psychopharmacologicaltreatments and participants who did not. Similar compari-sons could not be made within the BD group since onlyone participant was not on medication. There was no signif-icant age difference between the BD group and the MDDgroup. The Cronbach \u2019s alpha coef \ufb01cients indicated thatmost of the EMS subscales had adequate internal consisten-cies (Table 3). However, vulnerability to harm and illnessand enmeshment had coef \ufb01cients slightly below 0.70 andshould therefore be interpreted with caution. The t-tests(Table 3) revealed that the BD group scored signi \ufb01cantlyhigher than the MDD group on seven EMSs: abandonment,failure to achieve, and insuf \ufb01cient self-control, subjugation,unrelenting standards, enmeshment and entitlement. Thedifferences on entitlement remained signi \ufb01cant when con-trolling for the identi \ufb01ed sex difference ( t=4 . 4 5 , p=0 . 0 0 0 ) .An additional three EMSs were elevated in BD comparedwith MDD at a near-signi \ufb01cant level: mistrust, social isola-tion and dependence (Table 3).Table 2.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseDISCUSSIONThe present study compared EMSs between BD and MDDduring remission. The results revealed that the BD groupscored higher than the MDD group on most of the EMSscales, and for seven EMSs, the differences were statisticallysigni\ufb01cant: abandonment, failure to achieve, insuf \ufb01cientself-control, subjugation, unrelenting standards, enmesh-ment and entitlement. These \ufb01ndings extends previous\ufb01ndings by Hawke and Provencher (2012) by suggestingthat EMSs also tend to be more severe in BD compared withMDD during remission.The\ufb01ndings may be interpreted through a schematheory lens. According to Young et al. (2003), temperamentaldispositions interact with need-thwarting or traumatic earlylife experiences in the formation of EMSs. Studies suggestthat BD, compared with MDD, is associated with morechildhood traumas (Hyun, Friedman, & Dunner, 2000) andtemperamental dysregulation (Matsumoto et al ., 2005;Nowakowska et al., 2005; Savitz, van der Merwe, &Ramesar, 2008). Thus, a higher prevalence of the pro-posed origins of EMSs in BD may explain the greaterEMS severity in this disorder compared with MDD.Moreover, since EMSs purportedly continue their forma-tions in adulthood (Young et al., 2003), the illness courseof mood disorder may be assumed to play a role in theirformation. Compared with MDD, BD is characterizedby more frequent depres sive episodes (Forty et al., 2008),more comorbid anxiety disorders and personality disor-ders (Moreno et al., 2012) and an earlier illness onset(Tondo, Lepri, Cruz, & Baldessarini, 2010; Weissmanet al., 1996). A more pervasive illness course in BD maybe conceived as having detrimental effects that contributeto the higher EMS severity in this group compared withMDD.The\ufb01ndings may be considered in terms of their clinicalimplications. Schema therapy (ST; Young et al., 2003), apsychotherapeutic treatment which speci \ufb01cally targetsEMSs, has been found to have comparable ef \ufb01cacy withcognitive behaviour therapy in the treatment of MDD(Carter et al., 2013). Considering the higher EMS severityin BD compared with MDD, as indicated by the presentstudy, it is pertinent to contemplate whether ST wouldhave additional treatment effects if applied to BD. Hawke,Provenche, and Parikhb (2013) have proposed a modi \ufb01edversion of ST for BD which emphasizes mood stabilizationand prevention of affective relapses and recurrences. Thus,the effects of ST tailored the symptomatology of BD seemrelevant to investigate in future treatments studies.A number of methodological drawbacks need to be con-sidered when interpreting the \ufb01ndings. First, as describedelsewhere (Halvorsen et al., 2009; Halvorsen et al., 2010;Nilsson, 2012; Nilsson et al., 2010a), the assessment proce-dures used at two data-collection sites differed with regardto speci \ufb01c symptom measures and initial recruitmentstrategies. The present \ufb01ndings should therefore be consid-ered provisional and in need of further replication. Second,due to the cross-sectional design, the present study did notprovide any insights into causal mechanisms underlyingEMSs in the two mood disorders. The development ofEMSs in mood disorders therefore remains to be eluci-dated by longitudinal research.In conclusion, by suggesting that EMSs overall are moresevere in BD compared with MDD during remission, the\ufb01ndings elaborate the understanding of differences be-tween the two mood disorders. Moreover, the \ufb01ndingshighlight potential vulnerabilities in BD, which meritfurther investigation in terms of their underlying causesand potential treatment implications.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors do not have any commercial associationwhich might pose a con \ufb02ict of interest in connection withthe manuscript.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTThis study was partially made possible through fundinggranted to the \ufb01rst author from Aarhus University, Denmark.A n o t h e rp a r to ft h i ss t u d yw a ss u p p o r t e db yt h eN a t i o n a lProgram of Integrated Clinical Specialists and PhD trainingfor Psychologist in Norway and the Psychiatric ResearchCentre of Northern Norway.
