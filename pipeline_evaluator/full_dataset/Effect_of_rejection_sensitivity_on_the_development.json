However, the complex relationships among these factors have not been clarified. In this study, we\u00a0aimed to examine the mechanism by which these four characteristics influence the development of ADA.Methods:  We conducted a structured interview about ADA with 332 outpatients, who completed several self-report measures, to assess rejection sensitivity, rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms.Results:  A structural equation model showed goodness-of-fit with the data. These findings suggest that rejection sensitivity may demonstrate a direct effect on the occurrence of ADA. Furthermore, rejection sensitivity might affect depressive symptoms through rumination and social anxiety symptoms and consequently contribute to the development of ADA.Conclusion:  These results provide preliminary evidence that rejection sensitivity contributes to the development of ADA.KEYWORDSanxious-depressive attack, rejection sensitivity, rumination, social anxiety symptoms, depressive symptomsTYPE Original ResearchPUBLISHED  30 November 2022DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1016879OPEN ACCESSEDITED BYJiabao Lin,  Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, FranceREVIEWED BYGiovanni Mansueto,  University of Florence,  ItalyDara Kiu Yi Leung,  The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong SAR, China*CORRESPONDENCEShota Nodanorashouta@outlook.jpSPECIALTY SECTIONThis article was submitted to Psychopathology,  a section of the journal  Frontiers in PsychologyRECEIVED 11 August 2022ACCEPTED 01 November 2022PUBLISHED 30 November 2022CITATIONNoda S, Masaki M, Kishimoto T and Kaiya H (2022) Effect of rejection sensitivity on the development of anxious-depressive attack in Japanese outpatients: The mediating roles of rumination, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms.Front.

Table\u00a01  presents the diagnostic criteria of ADA ( Kaiya et\u00a0al., 2020 , revised). The prevalence of ADA among new patients visiting clinics for mood and anxiety disorders was estimated to be\u00a016.88% (Matsumoto et\u00a0al., 2020 ). ADA is a trans-diagnostic symptom complex, and many affected patients demonstrate comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, such as major depressive episodes, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder ( Kaiya, 2016 ; Noda et\u00a0 al., 2021 ). Patients with severe ADA symptoms tend to exhibit severe anxiety and depressive symptoms ( Kaiya, 2017 ; Noda et\u00a0 al., 2021 ). In many affected patients, ADA causes moderate to severe disturbances to activities of daily living ( Noda et\u00a0al., 2021 ).Results of a previous study indicated that rejection sensitivity plays a role in the development of ADA in patients with SAD in the following three ways: (1) rejection sensitivity triggers ADA directly; (2) rejection sensitivity intensifies depressive symptoms, which leads to ADA; and (3) rejection sensitivity intensifies social anxiety symptoms, which worsens depressive symptoms, which in turn leads to ADA ( Kaiya et\u00a0al., 2020 ). That study showed that rejection sensitivity is of central importance in the occurrence of ADA.Rejection sensitivity refers to a disposition toward anxious anticipation, ready perception, and overreaction to rejection (Downey and Feldman, 1996 ). Rejection sensitivity is a criterion specifying atypical features in bipolar and related disorders and depressive disorders as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ). Rejection sensitivity is also one of the core characteristics of SAD ( Liebowitz, 1987 ; Harb et\u00a0al., 2002 ), and leads to clinically troublesome pathological states or conditions, such as suicidal ideation ( Brown et\u00a0 al., 2019 ), aggression and victimization ( Gao et\u00a0al., 2021 ), social\u2013emotional maladjustment (Godleski et\u00a0al., 2019 ), and low self-esteem and loneliness ( Zhou et\u00a0 al., 2020 ). Rejection sensitivity is associated with anxiety, depressive symptoms, loneliness, borderline personality disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder ( Gao et\u00a0al., 2017 ) and is thought to be\u00a0caused by family conflict and maternal harshness in both childhood and adulthood ( Godleski et\u00a0al., 2019 ).Rejection sensitivity increases rumination ( Pearson et\u00a0 al., 2011 ), which is characterized by obsessional thinking involving excessive, repetitive thoughts of themes that interfere with other forms of mental activity ( American Psychological Association, n.d.). Nolen-Hoeksema et\u00a0al. (2008)  demonstrated that rumination predicts the onset of depression, exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking, impairs problem-solving skills, interferes with instrumental behavior, and erodes social support. Rumination may also be\u00a0 an important sign of severe clinical symptoms, including depression, dysphoria, suicidal ideation, cognitive complaints, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and aggression, in patients with a history of childhood adversities ( Mansueto et\u00a0al., 2021 ). Furthermore, rumination is associated with several psychological symptoms, including eating disorders ( Palmieri et\u00a0al., 2021 ) and emotion regulation difficulties ( Mansueto et\u00a0al., 2022 ). According to Pearson et\u00a0al. (2011) , rumination correlates with a specific maladaptive interpersonal style consisting of submissive (overly accommodating, nonassertive, and self-sacrificing) behaviors characteristic of SAD. Individuals with SAD or major depressive disorder reported higher levels of rumination than healthy controls, with no difference in the levels of rumination between the two disorders. Moreover, the comorbidity of these two disorders is prominently associated with rumination (Arditte Hall et\u00a0al., 2019 ). The intensity of social anxiety correlates with rumination over time in patients undergoing cognitive\u2013behavioral therapy for SAD ( Brozovich et\u00a0al., 2015 ).SAD is closely related to depression. A national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions revealed that the lifetime prevalence of any mood disorder among patients with SAD was 56.3% ( Grant et\u00a0al., 2005 ). In Japan, SAD is a strong predictor of the first onset of depression ( Tsuchiya et\u00a0al., 2009 ). Compared with SAD alone, the combination of SAD and depression exhibits a more malignant course characterized by an increased risk of suicide attempts and disease chronicity ( Stein, 2006 ). Individuals TABLE\u00a01 Diagnostic criteria for anxious-depressive attack.A. Anxious-depressive attack occurs suddenly and recurrently regardless of one\u2019s situation in various mental disorders.B. The following symptoms occur in descending order of frequency, but symptom no. 4 is not always present:1. Abrupt surge of intense discomfort, consisting of mixed emotions of an anxious and depressive nature, with or without the urge to weep. The discomfort peaks within several seconds or less than a minute after onset.2. Intrusive rumination, including mostly negative memories, consisting of mainly recent or past adverse events (flashbacks) or, in rare cases, worry, which continues for a range of time from several minutes to several hours.3. Prominent agitation, unrest, or loneliness that occurs during rumination and is occasionally very violent and inappropriate in comparison to ruminative subjects.4. Various coping behaviors to manage intense discomfort occasionally appear.C. Physical symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath and palpitations) are extremely mild.D. The disturbance is not attributable to the direct psychological effects of any stress, physiological effects of a substance, or a neurological or other medical condition.E. The disturbance is not better explained by another neuropsychiatric disorder (e.g., panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, nonepileptic seizure, frontal epilepsy, intermittent explosive disorder, anxious distress specified for depression, sudden emotional excitement of schizophrenia, or Ataque de nervios ).Adapted from Kaiya et\u00a0al. (2020) , with permission from The Japanese Society of Anxiety and Related Disorders (JSARD).Noda et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1016879Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.orgwith depression comorbid with anxiety disorders, especially SAD, often exhibit atypical features. Koyuncu et\u00a0al. (2015)  reported that 77.1% of depression comorbid with SAD was atypical.Based on the information above, rejection sensitivity, rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms, especially with atypical features, have mutual relationships and may contribute to the pathogenesis of ADA. Thus, to reanalyze the pathogenesis of ADA using structural equation modeling (SEM), in the current study, we\u00a0added rumination as a causative element in patients with SAD and in other patients who visited anxiety-depression clinics. We\u00a0hypothesized that rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between rejection sensitivity and ADA. To examine the relationship among these variables, we\u00a0 constructed a hypothetical model (Figure\u00a01 ) and examined the validity of the model.Materials and methodsParticipantsParticipants were outpatients seeking treatment at a clinic for mood and anxiety disorders in Nagoya/Aichi Prefecture, Japan, aged \u226518 years. Exclusion criteria included high suicide risk, severe physical illness, and significant cognitive impairment. After we\u00a0obtained written informed consent, 421 outpatients participated in the survey. Of these, 332 completed all the scales and participated in the interview. To examine the effect of rejection sensitivity on the development of ADA, we\u00a0analyzed the data of these 332 participants.Diagnosis and measuresMental illness was diagnosed in accordance with the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ). In addition, ADA was diagnosed through a structured interview with the participants using the diagnostic criteria for ADA ( Kaiya, 2017 ). ADA was regarded as present only when the diagnoses of one of the two psychiatrists (Tomokazu Kishimoto and Hisanobu Kaiya) and a psychologist (Mina Masaki) were in agreement. We\u00a0 used the following self-administered measures to assess patients\u2019 symptoms:Japanese version of the interpersonal sensitivity measureThe interpersonal sensitivity measure (IPSM) was developed by Boyce and Parker (1989)  to assess the tendency to be\u00a0sensitive to rejection by others. Each item is scored from 1 (very unlike you) to 4 (very like you). Suyama et\u00a0al. (2014)  developed the Japanese version of the IPSM, which consists of five subscales, including \u201cfear of breakup of a relationship, \u201d \u201cunassertive interpersonal behavior due to fear of hurting others, \u201d \u201cfear of criticism by others, \u201d \u201cdiscrepancy between social self-image and true self-image, \u201d and \u201cobsequence to others. \u201d The scale has 27 items, and the total score ranges from 27 to 108, with higher scores indicating greater sensitivity to rejection by others. The Japanese version of the IPSM has good internal consistency and convergent validity ( Suyama et\u00a0 al., 2014 ) and exhibited good internal consistency in this study (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.92).Japanese version of the ruminative response scaleThe ruminative response scale (RRS) was developed by Treynor et\u00a0 al. (2003)  to assess rumination about brooding, reflection, and depressive symptoms. The scale consists of 22 items, and each item is scored from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always). The total score ranges from 22 to 88, with higher scores indicating greater rumination. The Japanese version of the RRS has good internal consistency, test\u2013retest reliability, and convergent validity ( Hasegawa, 2013 ) and exhibited good internal consistency in this study (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.94).Japanese version of the Liebowitz social anxiety scaleThe Liebowitz social anxiety scale (LSAS) was developed by Liebowitz (1987)  to assess social anxiety symptoms reflected by anxiety and avoidance of social situations. The scale consists of 24 items each for anxiety and avoidance behavior. The sum of these items is the score for social anxiety symptoms. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (none on the anxiety scale and never on the avoidance behavior scale) to 3 (severe on the anxiety scale and usually on the avoidance behavior scale). The total score ranges from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating greater social anxiety symptoms. The Japanese version of the LSAS has good internal consistency, test\u2013retest reliability, factorial validity, and convergent validity ( Asakura et\u00a0al., 2002 ; Okajima et\u00a0al., 2007 ) and exhibited good internal consistency in this study (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.98).Japanese version of the quick inventory of depressive symptomatologyThe quick inventory of depressive symptomatology (QIDS) was developed by Rush et\u00a0 al. (2003)  to assess depressive symptoms according to nine symptom domains in major depressive disorder, including sleep and appetite/weight change. Items are scored from 0 to 3. The total score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms. The Japanese version of the QIDS has good internal consistency and convergent validity ( Fujisawa et\u00a0al., 2010 ) and exhibited good internal consistency in this study (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.84).Statistical analysesFirst, chi-square and t-tests were used to compare patients with and without ADA. Second, using weighted least-squares mean-and variance-adjusted estimators, SEM was performed to determine how rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms mediate the association between rejection sensitivity and ADA.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their enrollment in the study.ResultsDemographics of patientsTable\u00a0 2  lists psychiatrists\u2019 diagnoses and the clinical characteristics of the participants. Of the 332 patients, 141 were men, and 191 were women (mean age, 34.35 \u00b1 12.92 years). Depressive disorders were diagnosed in 103 patients (31.02%) and anxiety disorders in 97 (29.22%). The presence of ADA was confirmed in 59 patients (12 men and 47 women; mean age, 27.73 \u00b1 7.15 years) and the absence of ADA in 273 patients (129 men and 144 women; mean age, 35.78 \u00b1 13.45 years). Thus, the prevalence of ADA was 17.77%. Furthermore, the patient group with ADA consisted of more females and younger patients than the group of patients without ADA (p < 0.01). Patients with ADA demonstrated high rates of comorbidity, including major depressive disorder (33.90%), major depressive disorder with atypical features (28.81%), SAD (8.47%), panic disorder (6.78%), and panic disorder with agoraphobia (5.08%). The rate of comorbid major depressive disorder with atypical features was significantly higher in patients with ADA compared with the rate in patients without ADA ( p < 0.01).SEMThe results of the hypothesized model showed goodness-of-fit with the data ( \u03c72 = 0.10, df = 1, p = 0.76; comparative fit index = 1.000; Tucker\u2013Lewis Index = 1.000; root mean square error of approximation = 0.000, 90% confidence interval = 0.000\u20130.099; and standardized root mean square residual = 0.004). The standardized parameter estimates for rejection sensitivity were significant with regard to rumination ( \u03b2 = 0.60, p < 0.001), social anxiety symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.42, p < 0.001), depressive symptoms ( \u03b2 = 0.11, p < 0.05), and ADA (\u03b2 = 0.22, p < 0.05). The estimates for rumination were significant with regard to social anxiety symptoms ( \u03b2 = 0.28, p < 0.001) and depressive symptoms ( \u03b2 = 0.50, p < 0.001). In contrast, the estimate for rumination with regard to ADA was not significant ( \u03b2 = 0.11, p = 0.40).

The model is shown in Figure\u00a01 .DiscussionThe present study aimed to determine the association between rejection sensitivity and rumination, social anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and ADA in Japanese outpatients who visited a mood and anxiety disorder clinic. We\u00a0 hypothesized that rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms demonstrate significant mediating effects on the relationship between rejection sensitivity and ADA, and we\u00a0used SEM to test this hypothesis. The results of SEM showed that the hypothesized model\u2019s goodness-of-fit indices demonstrated high values. Our SEM model matched substantially, which can be\u00a0explained by the two reasons. Firstly, our previous research ( Kaiya et\u00a0al., 2020 ) has established a model similar to the present model, except for the item of ruminative thinking. Secondly, as mentioned in the introduction, a close relationship between the variables in our SEM model has been clinically demonstrated. This suggested that (1) rejection sensitivity is directly associated with ADA, (2) depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between rejection sensitivity and ADA, and (3) social anxiety symptoms mediate the relationship between rejection sensitivity and depressive symptoms; all these findings are consistent TABLE\u00a02 Clinical characteristics of participants.Demographics All patients ( N = 332) Patients with ADA (n = 59)Patients without ADA (n = 273)Chi-square value/ t-valueNumber of men 141 (100%) 12 (8.51%) 129 (91.49%) 14.38**Mean age ( SD) 34.35 (\u00b112.92) 27.73 (\u00b17.15) 35.78 (\u00b113.45) 6.51**Primary diagnosis, nAutism spectrum disorder 3 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 3 (100%) 0.65Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 14 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 14 (100%) 3.16Delusional disorder 1 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 1 (100%) 0.22Schizophrenia\u20203 (100%) 1 (33.33%) 2 (66.67%) 0.50Bipolar disorder\u20206 (100%) 1 (16.67%) 5 (83.33%) 0.01Major depressive disorder\u202080 (100%) 20 (25.00%) 60 (75.00%) 3.77Major depressive disorder with atypical features\u202019 (100%) 17 (89.47%) 2 (10.53%) 70.91**Major depressive disorder with a seasonal pattern2 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 2 (100%) 0.44Persistent depressive disorder 2 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 2 (100%) 0.44Specific phobia\u20208 (100%) 1 (12.50%) 7 (87.50%) 0.16Social anxiety disorder\u202037 (100%) 5 (13.51%) 32 (86.49%) 0.52Panic disorder\u202029 (100%) 4 (13.79%) 25 (86.21%) 0.34Agoraphobia\u20201 (100%) 1 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 4.64Panic disorder with agoraphobia\u202018 (100%) 3 (16.67%) 15 (83.33%) 0.02Generalized anxiety disorder 4 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 4 (100%) 0.88Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder\u202018 (100%) 2 (11.11%) 16 (88.89%) 0.58Post-traumatic stress disorder 3 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 3 (100%) 0.65Acute stress disorder 1 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 1 (100%) 0.22Adjustment disorder 17 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 17 (100%) 3.87Insomnia disorder\u202015 (100%) 1 (6.67%) 14 (93.33%) 1.33Narcolepsy 1 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 1 (100%) 0.22Unspecified personality disorder 1 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 1 (100%) 0.22Depressive state\u202014 (100%) 2 (14.29%) 12 (85.71%) 0.12Other (unspecified or other symptoms)\u202035 (100%) 1 (2.86%) 34 (97.14%) 5.96*Descriptive statisticsInterpersonal sensitivity measure 77.52 (\u00b114.08) 86.27 (\u00b110.73) 75.63 (\u00b114.02) \u22126.41**Ruminative responses scale 53.52 (\u00b115.65) 63.46 (\u00b111.96) 51.38 (\u00b115.54) \u22126.64**Quick inventory of depressive symptomatology11.97 (\u00b15.80) 16.08 (\u00b14.58) 11.08 (\u00b15.65) \u22126.37**Liebowitz social anxiety scale 48.73 (\u00b135.23) 68.49 (\u00b134.32) 44.46 (\u00b134.00) \u22124.91**ADA, anxious-depressive attack; SD, standard deviation; \u2020Includes patients with ADA; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01.Noda et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1016879Frontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.orgwith those in a previous study ( Kaiya et\u00a0 al., 2020 ). In addition, rumination was shown to mediate the relationship between rejection sensitivity and social anxiety or depressive symptoms. The relationship between rejection sensitivity and rumination was significant, but that between rumination and ADA was not. Therefore, we\u00a0consider that rumination is not directly associated with ADA but is associated with depressive symptoms that trigger ADA. These findings suggest that depressive symptoms may mediate the effect of rejection sensitivity on the development of ADA and that rumination and social anxiety symptoms may mediate the effect of rejection sensitivity on depressive symptoms that trigger ADA.In the present study, the prevalence rates of ADA in all subjects and in patients with atypical depression were 17.77 and 89.54%, respectively, which were compatible with those of our previous reports ( Kaiya, 2017 ; Matsumoto et\u00a0 al., 2020 ). The finding that ADA was most common in atypical depression is reasonable because rejection sensitivity, which is considered one of the basic psychopathological manifestations of ADA, as shown in this study, was reported as a symptom of high diagnostic significance in atypical depression ( Thase, 2009 ).The severity of ADA symptoms is positively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, and ADA symptoms disrupt the lives of many affected patients ( Noda et\u00a0al., 2021 ). Therefore, in patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms, ADA should be\u00a0identified as early as possible. In this study, rejection sensitivity and depressive symptoms were directly related to ADA, which suggests that patients with high levels of rejection sensitivity and depressive symptoms are at a high risk for developing ADA.Furthermore, this model suggests that rejection sensitivity is an important predictor of ADA. Therefore, interventions targeting rejection sensitivity should be\u00a0implemented in the management and prevention of ADA. Mindfulness training may be\u00a0 an option for treating ADA. Trait mindfulness is negatively associated with rejection sensitivity ( Sheng et\u00a0 al., 2022 ). In particular, the nonjudgment factor of trait mindfulness negatively predicts rejection sensitivity ( Peters et\u00a0al., 2016 ). Keng and Tan (2018)  demonstrated that brief mindfulness training is effective in improving negative affect and feelings of rejection after social rejection. Furthermore, mindfulness training is effective in improving rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms ( Deyo et\u00a0al., 2009 ; Goldin and Gross, 2010 ). These findings suggest that mindfulness training may be\u00a0an effective intervention for ADA.This study has several limitations. First, a longitudinal design should be\u00a0 used to assess the associations among the variables addressed in this study to validate a causal relationship. In the model that we\u00a0constructed, the direction of causality was assumed based on the results of previous studies, and its validity was examined. However, a cross-sectional design was used in this study; thus, the causal relationships among these variables could not be\u00a0established. Second, this study was conducted in a specialized clinic for anxiety and depression. Because most patients visiting this clinic present with anxiety and depressive disorders, the possibility exists that the results may have been biased. Future studies should be\u00a0conducted in hospitals and clinics that specialize in a wide range of mental illnesses. Third, patients who visited the clinic for the first time were included in this study, and the eligibility criteria included patients treated with and without pharmacotherapy. The model should be\u00a0assessed separately for patients treated with pharmacotherapy and patients who were not treated with pharmacotherapy. Finally, the development of ADA should be\u00a0 further tested. Adverse childhood experiences and childhood emotional abuse/maltreatment are associated with rejection sensitivity, rumination, and clinical symptoms ( Chesin et\u00a0al., 2015 ; Pierce et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Mansueto et\u00a0al., 2021 ). A model showing the effects of rejection sensitivity on ADA could be\u00a0established in the future.ConclusionThis study provides preliminary evidence suggesting that rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms mediate the effect of rejection sensitivity on the development of ADA. This evidence is an impetus for future research to understand the psychopathogenesis of ADA and its treatment.Data availability statementDetailed data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.Ethics statementThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Medical Corporation Warakukai Ethics Review Board.
