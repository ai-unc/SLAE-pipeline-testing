Four characteristics—rejection\nsensitivity, rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms—\nare thought to be associated with the development of ADA. However, the\ncomplex relationships among these factors have not been clarified. In this\nstudy, we aimed to examine the mechanism by which these four characteristics\ninfluence the development of ADA.\n\nMethods: We conducted a structured interview about ADA with 332\noutpatients, who completed several self-report measures, to assess rejection\nsensitivity, rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms.\n\nResults: A structural equation model showed goodness-of-fit with the data.\nThese findings suggest that rejection sensitivity may demonstrate a direct\neffect on the occurrence of ADA. Furthermore, rejection sensitivity might\naffect depressive symptoms through rumination and social anxiety symptoms\nand consequently contribute to the development of ADA.\n\nConclusion: These results provide preliminary evidence that rejection\nsensitivity contributes to the development of ADA.\n\nKEYWORDS\n\nanxious-depressive attack, rejection sensitivity, rumination, social anxiety\nsymptoms, depressive symptoms\n\n01 frontiersin.org\n\n\nNoda etal.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAnxious-depressive attack (ADA) is a complex of four\nsymptoms: (1) abrupt outbursts of anxious and/or depressive\nfeelings; (2) intrusive rumination about painful memories or\nfuture worries with or without flashbacks; (3) prominent agitation,\nunrest, or loneliness; and, in some cases, (4) a wide range of\ncoping behaviors to manage emotional distress (Kaiya, 2017).\nTable 1 presents the diagnostic criteria of ADA (Kaiya et al., 2020,\nrevised). The prevalence of ADA among new patients visiting\nclinics for mood and anxiety disorders was estimated to be 16.88%\n(Matsumoto et al, 2020). ADA is a trans-diagnostic symptom\ncomplex, and many affected patients demonstrate comorbid mood\nand anxiety disorders, such as major depressive episodes,\nagoraphobia, social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety\ndisorder, and panic disorder (Kaiya, 2016; Noda et al, 2021).\nPatients with severe ADA symptoms tend to exhibit severe anxiety\nand depressive symptoms (Kaiya, 2017; Noda et al, 2021). In\nmany affected patients, ADA causes moderate to severe\ndisturbances to activities of daily living (Noda et al., 2021).\nResults of a previous study indicated that rejection sensitivity\nplays a role in the development of ADA in patients with SAD in\nthe following three ways: (1) rejection sensitivity triggers ADA\ndirectly; (2) rejection sensitivity intensifies depressive symptoms,\nwhich leads to ADA; and (3) rejection sensitivity intensifies social\nanxiety symptoms, which worsens depressive symptoms, which in\nturn leads to ADA (Kaiya et al., 2020). That study showed that\n\nsens the\n\nrejection ity is of central importance in\noccurrence of ADA.\n\nRejection sensitivity refers to a disposition toward anxious\nanticipation, ready perception, and overreaction to rejection\n(Downey and Feldman, 1996). Rejection sensitivity is a criterion\nspecifying atypical features in bipolar and related disorders and\ndepressive disorders as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2013). Rejection sensitivity is also one of the core\ncharacteristics of SAD (Liebowitz, 1987; Harb et al, 2002), and\nleads to clinically troublesome pathological states or conditions,\nsuch as suicidal ideation (Brown et al, 2019), aggression and\nvictimization (Gao et al, 2021), social-emotional maladjustment\n(Godleski et al., 2019), and low self-esteem and loneliness (Zhou\net al, 2020). Rejection sensitivity is associated with anxiety,\ndepressive symptoms, loneliness, borderline personality disorder,\nand body dysmorphic disorder (Gao et al, 2017) and is thought\nto be caused by family conflict and maternal harshness in both\nchildhood and adulthood (Godleski et al., 2019).\n\nRejection sensitivity increases rumination (Pearson et al.\n2011), which is characterized by obsessional thinking involving\nexcessive, repetitive thoughts of themes that interfere with other\nforms of mental activity (American Psychological Association,\nn.d.). Nolen-Hoeksema et al. (2008) demonstrated that rumination\npredicts the onset of depression, exacerbates depression, enhances\nnegative thinking, impairs problem-solving skills, interferes with\ninstrumental behavior, and erodes social support. Rumination\n\nFrontiers in Psychology\n\n02\n\n10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1016879\n\nTABLE 1 Diagnostic criteria for anxious-depressive attack.\n\nA. Anxious-depressive attack occurs suddenly and recurrently regardless of\nones situation in various mental disorders,\n\nB. The following symptoms occur in descending order of frequency, but\nsymptom no. 4 is not always present:\n\n1. Abrupt surge of intense discomfort, consisting of mixed emotions of an\n‘anxious and depressive nature, with or without the urge to weep. The\ndiscomfort peaks within several seconds or less than a minute after onset.\n\n2. Intrusive rumination, including mostly negative memories, consisting of\n‘mainly recent or past adverse events (flashbacks) or, in rare cases, worry, which\ncontinues for a range of time from several minutes to several hours.\n\n3. Prominent agitation, unrest, or loneliness that occurs during rumination and\nis occasionally very violent and inappropriate in comparison to ruminative\nsubjects.\n\n4. Various coping behaviors to manage intense discomfort occasionally appear.\nC. Physical symptoms (e.g, shortness of breath and palpitations) are extremely\nmild\n\nD. The disturbance is not attributable to the direct psychological effects of any\nstress, physiological effects of a substance, or a neurological or other medical\ncondition.\n\nE. The disturbance is not better explained by another neuropsychiatric disorder\n(e.g. panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, nonepileptic seizure,\nfrontal epilepsy, intermittent explosive disorder, anxious distress specified for\ndepression, sudden emotional excitement of schizophrenia, or Ataque de\n\nnervios).\n\n‘Adapted from Kaiya ct al. (2020), with permission from The Japanese Society of Anxiety\nand Related Disorders (JSARD).\n\nmay also be an important sign of severe clinical symptoms,\nincluding depression, dysphoria, suicidal ideation, cognitive\ncomplaints, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and aggression, in\npatients with a history of childhood adversities (Mansueto et al.,\n2021). Furthermore, rumination is associated with several\npsychological symptoms, including eating disorders (Palmieri\netal, 2021) and emotion regulation difficulties (Mansueto et al.,\n2022). According to Pearson et al. (2011), rumination correlates\nwith a specific maladaptive interpersonal style consisting of\nsubmissive (overly accommodating, nonassertive, and self-\nsacrificing) behaviors characteristic of SAD. Individuals with SAD\nor major depressive disorder reported higher levels of rumination\nthan healthy controls, with no difference in the levels of\nrumination between the two disorders. Moreover, the comorbidity\nof these two disorders is prominently associated with rumination\n(Arditte Hall et al, 2019). The intensity of social anxiety correlates\nwith rumination over time in patients undergoing cognitive—\nbehavioral therapy for SAD (Brozovich et al., 2015).\n\nSAD is closely related to depression. A national epidemiologic\nsurvey on alcohol and related conditions revealed that the lifetime\nprevalence of any mood disorder among patients with SAD was\n56.3% (Grant ct al,, 2005). In Japan, SAD is a strong predictor of\nthe first onset of depression (Tsuchiya et al., 2009). Compared\nwith SAD alone, the combination of SAD and depression exhibits\na more malignant course characterized by an increased risk of\nsuicide attempts and disease chronicity (Stein, 2006). Individuals\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\nNoda etal.\n\nwith depression comorbid with anxiety disorders, especially SAD,\n\noften exhibit atypical features. Koyuncu et al. (2015) reported that\n\n77.1% of depression comorbid with SAD was atypical.\nBased on the information above, rejection sensiti\n\nrumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms,\nespecially with atypical features, have mutual relationships and may\ncontribute to the pathogenesis of ADA. Thus, to reanalyze the\npathogenesis of ADA using structural equation modeling (SEM),\nin the current study, we added rumination as a causative element\nin patients with SAD and in other patients who visited anxiety-\ndepression clinics. We hypothesized that rumination, social anxiety\nsymptoms, and depressive symptoms mediate the relationship\nbetween rejection sensitivity and ADA. To examine the relationship\namong these variables, we constructed a hypothetical model\n(Figure 1) and examined the validity of the model.\n\nMaterials and methods\nParticipants\n\nParticipants were outpatients seeking treatment at a clinic for\nmood and anxiety disorders in Nagoya/ Aichi Prefecture, Japan, aged\n>18years. Exclusion criteria included high suicide risk, severe\nphysical illness, and significant cognitive impairment. After\nwe obtained written informed consent, 421 outpatients participated\nin the survey. Of these, 332 completed all the scales and participated\nin the interview. To examine the effect of rejection sensitivity on the\ndevelopment of ADA, we analyzed the data of these 332 participants.\n\nDiagnosis and measures\n\nMental illness was diagnosed in accordance with the DSM-5\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2013). In addition, ADA was\ndiagnosed through a structured interview with the participants using\nthe diagnostic criteria for ADA (Kaiya, 2017). ADA was regarded as\npresent only when the diagnoses of one of the two psychiatrists\n(Tomokazu Kishimoto and Hisanobu Kaiya) and a psychologist\n(Mina Masaki) were in agreement. We used the following self-\nadministered measures to assess patients’ symptoms:\n\nJapanese version of the interpersonal\nsensitivity measure\n\n‘The interpersonal sensitivity measure (IPSM) was developed by\nBoyce and Parker (1989) to assess the tendency to be sensitive to\nrejection by others. Each item is scored from 1 (very unlike you) to 4\n(very like you). Suyama et al. (2014) developed the Japanese version\nof the IPSM, which consists of five subscales, including “fear of\nbreakup of a relationship; “unassertive interpersonal behavior due to\nfear of hurting others; “fear of criticism by others; “discrepancy\nbetween social self-image and true self-image,’ and “obsequence to\nothers” The scale has 27 items, and the total score ranges from 27 to\n108, with higher scores indicating greater sensitivity to rejection by\n\nFrontiers in Psychology\n\n03\n\n10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1016879\n\nothers. The Japanese version of the IPSM has good internal\nconsistency and convergent validity (Suyama et al, 2014) and\nexhibited good internal consistency in this study (Cronbachs\na=092).\n\nJapanese version of the ruminative response\nscale\n\nThe ruminative response scale (RRS) was developed by\nTreynor et al. (2003) to assess rumination about brooding,\nreflection, and depressive symptoms. The scale consists of 22\nitems, and each item is scored from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost\nalways). The total score ranges from 22 to 88, with higher scores\nindicating greater rumination. The Japanese version of the RRS\nhas good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and\nconvergent validity (Hasegawa, 2013) and exhibited good internal\nconsistency in this study (Cronbach's a=0.94).\n\nJapanese version of the Liebowitz social\nanxiety scale\n\n‘The Liebowitz social anxiety scale (LSAS) was developed by\nLiebowitz (1987) to assess social anxiety symptoms reflected by\nanxiety and avoidance of social situations. The scale consists of 24\nitems each for anxiety and avoidance behavior. The sum of these\nitems is the score for social anxiety symptoms. Each item is rated\non a 4-point scale from 0 (none on the anxiety scale and never on\nthe avoidance behavior scale) to 3 (severe on the anxiety scale and\nusually on the avoidance behavior scale). The total score ranges\nfrom 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating greater social anxiety\nsymptoms. The Japanese version of the LSAS has good internal\nconsistency, test-retest reliability, factorial validity, and convergent\nvalidity (Asakura et al, 2002; Okajima et al, 2007) and exhibited\ngood internal consistency in this study (Cronbach's a=0.98).\n\nJapanese version of the quick inventory of\ndepressive symptomatology\n\nThe quick inventory of depressive symptomatology (QIDS)\nwas developed by Rush et al. (2003) to assess depressive\nsymptoms according to nine symptom domains in major\ndepressive disorder, including sleep and appetite/weight change.\nItems are scored from 0 to 3. The total score ranges from 0 to 27,\nwith higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms. The\nJapanese version of the QIDS has good internal consistency and\nconvergent validity (Fujisawa et al, 2010) and exhibited good\ninternal consistency in this study (Cronbach's a= 0.84).\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nFirst, chi-square and t-tests were used to compare patients\nwith and without ADA. Second, using weighted least-squares\nmean-and variance-adjusted estimators, SEM was performed to\ndetermine how rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and\ndepressive symptoms mediate the association between rejection\nsensitivity and ADA.

The model is shown in Figure 1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe present study aimed to determine the association between\nrejection sensitivity and rumination, social anxiety symptoms,\ndepressive symptoms, and ADA in Japanese outpatients who visited\na mood and anxiety disorder clinic. We hypothesized that\nrumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms\ndemonstrate significant mediating effects on the relationship\n\nFrontiers in Psychology\n\nbetween rejection sensitivity and ADA, and we used SEM to test this\nhypothesis. The results of SEM showed that the hypothesized model's\n‘goodness-of-fit indices demonstrated high values. Our SEM model\n‘matched substantially, which can be explained by the two reasons.\nFirstly, our previous research (Kaiya et al, 2020) has established a\n‘model similar to the present model, except for the item of ruminative\nthinking, Secondly; as mentioned in the introduction, a close\nrelationship between the variables in our SEM model has been\nclinically demonstrated. This suggested that (1) rejection sensitivity\nis directly associated with ADA, (2) depressive symptoms mediate\nthe relationship between rejection sensitivity and ADA, and (3)\nsocial anxiety symptoms mediate the relationship between rejection\nsensitivity and depressive symptoms; all these findings are consistent\n\n05 frontiersin.org\n\n\nNoda etal.\n\nwith those in a previous study (Kaiya et al, 2020). In addition,\nrumination was shown to mediate the relationship between rejection\nsensitivity and social anxiety or depressive symptoms. The\nrelationship between rejection sensitivity and rumination was\nsignificant, but that between rumination and ADA was not.\n‘Therefore, we consider that rumination is not directly associated\nwith ADA but is associated with depressive symptoms that trigger\nADA. These findings suggest that depressive symptoms may mediate\nthe effect of rejection sensitivity on the development of ADA and\nthat rumination and social anxiety symptoms may mediate the effect\nof rejection sensitivity on depressive symptoms that trigger ADA.\n\nIn the present study, the prevalence rates of ADA in all\nsubjects and in patients with atypical depression were 17.77 and\n89.54%, respectively, which were compatible with those of our\nprevious reports (Kaiya, 2017; Matsumoto et al, 2020). The\nfinding that ADA was most common in atypical depression is\nreasonable because rejection sensitivity, which is considered one\nof the basic psychopathological manifestations of ADA, as shown\nin this study, was reported as a symptom of high diagnostic\nsignificance in atypical depression (Thase, 2009).\n\nThe severity of ADA symptoms is positively associated with\nanxiety and depressive symptoms, and ADA symptoms disrupt\nthe lives of many affected patients (Noda et al, 2021). Therefore,\nin patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms, ADA should\nbe identified as early as possible. In this study, rejection sensitivity\nand depressive symptoms were directly related to ADA, which\nsuggests that patients with high levels of rejection sensitivity and\ndepressive symptoms are at a high risk for developing ADA.\n\nFurthermore, this model suggests that rejection sensitivity is an\nimportant predictor of ADA. Therefore, interventions targeting\nrejection sensitivity should be implemented in the management and\nprevention of ADA. Mindfulness training may be an option for\ntreating ADA. Trait mindfulness is negatively associated with\nrejection sensitivity (Sheng et al, 2022). In particular, the\nnonjudgment factor of trait mindfulness negatively predicts rejection\nsensitivity (Peters et al, 2016). Keng and Tan (2018) demonstrated\nthat brief mindfulness training is effective in improving negative\naffect and feelings of rejection after social rejection. Furthermore,\n‘mindfulness training is effective in improving rumination, social\nanxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms (Deyo et al, 2009;\nGoldin and Gross, 2010). These findings suggest that mindfulness\ntraining may be an effective intervention for ADA.\n\n‘This study has several limitations. First, a longitudinal design\nshould be used to assess the associations among the variables\naddressed in this study to validate a causal relationship. In the model\nthat we constructed, the direction of causality was assumed based on\nthe results of previous studies, and its validity was examined. However,\na cross-sectional design was used in this study; thus, the causal\nrelationships among these variables could not be established. Second,\nthis study was conducted in a specialized clinic for anxiety and\ndepression. Because most patients visiting this clinic present with\nanxiety and depressive disorders, the possibility exists that the results\n‘may have been biased. Future studies should be conducted in hospitals\nand clinics that specialize in a wide range of mental illnesses. Third,\n\nFrontiers in Psychology\n\n06\n\n10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1016879\n\npatients who visited the clinic for the first time were included in this\nstudy, and the eligibility criteria included patients treated with and\n‘without pharmacotherapy. The model should be assessed separately\nfor patients treated with pharmacotherapy and patients who were not\ntreated with pharmacotherapy. Finally, the development of ADA\nshould be further tested. Adverse childhood experiences and\nchildhood emotional abuse/maltreatment are associated with rejection\nsensitivity, rumination, and clinical symptoms (Chesin et al, 2015;\nPierce etal, 2018; Mansueto et al., 2021). A model showing the effects\nof rejection sensitivity on ADA could be established in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study provides preliminary evidence suggesting that\nrumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms\nmediate the effect of rejection sensitivity on the development of\nADA. This evidence is an impetus for future research to\nunderstand the psychopathogenesis of ADA and its treatment.\n\nData availability statement\n\nDetailed data are available from the corresponding author\nupon reasonable request.\n\nEthics statement\n\n‘The studies involving human participants were reviewed and\napproved by Medical Corporation Warakukai Ethics Review\nBoard.
