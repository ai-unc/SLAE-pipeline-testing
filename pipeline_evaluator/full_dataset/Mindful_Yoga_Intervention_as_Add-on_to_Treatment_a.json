Method: Randomized controlled trial (RCT; n=171) comparing TAU +MYI with TAU-only.Assessments were at baseline, postintervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Primary outcomemeasures were clinician-rated and self-reported symptoms of depression, together with a diagnostic interviewto establish MDD diagnosis that was restricted to the baseline and 12-month follow-up assessments. Qualityof life in various domains was assessed as secondary outcome measure. As potential mediators for treatmentef\ufb01cacy, we included self-report measures of rumination, self-criticism, self-compassion, intolerance ofuncertainty, perceived body awareness and dispositional mindfulness, together with behavioral measures ofattentional bias (AB) and depression-related self-associations. Results: Adding MYI to TAU did not lead togreater reduction of depression symptoms, lower rate of MDD diagnosis or increase in quality of life invarious domains of functioning at post and follow-up assessments. There were no indirect effects through anyof the potential mediators, with the exception of self-compassion. Conclusion: Adding MYI to TAUappeared not more ef \ufb01cacious than TAU-only in reducing depression symptoms in young women.What is the public health signi \ufb01cance of this article?Overall, this study suggests that adding a mindful yoga intervention to treatment as usual for youngwomen with depression does not lead to increased bene \ufb01ts in terms of stronger reduction in symptoms ofdepression, lower rate of major depressive disorder diagnosis, or better quality of life within variousdomains of functioning.Keywords: depression, women, mindfulness, yoga, mediatorsSupplemental materials: https://doi.org/10.1037/ccp0000777.suppThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.Content may be shared at no cost, but any requests to reuse this content in part or whole must go through the American Psychological Association.Nina K.

It is estimated that womenare two times more likely to develop major depressive disorder(MDD) than men during their lives ( Bromet et al., 2011 ), and youngwomen (aged 18 \u201334) are especially at high risk of developingMDD ( De Graaf et al., 2012 ). Although a small majority of patientseventually receives treatment during their lifetime (57%; Rubioet al., 2011 ), these patients often do not respond (fully) to treatment.For example, research has shown that only about 50% respond topsychotherapy and medication treatment ( Casacalenda et al., 2002 ).Further, a substantial number (about 40%) continues to experienceresidual symptoms ( Conradi et al., 2011 ) and relapse rates are high1\u20132 years posttreatment (26% \u201343%; Steinert et al., 2014 ). Fromthese data, it becomes clear that there is a need to further optimizetreatment as usual for MDD.One way to enhance the ef \ufb01cacy of treatment is to offer acombination of interventions. For instance, there is evidence thata combination of medication and psychotherapy was more effectivethan medication alone ( Karyotaki et al., 2016 ). Similarly, adjunctiveinterventions such as relaxation, creative expression therapy, exer-cise, and mindfulness-based interventions show potential in opti-mizing standard treatment for acute depression or relapse prevention(Spijker et al., 2012 ). One intervention that offers a combination ofmindfulness and exercise is mindful yoga, a mind-body practiceconsisting of physical postures, breathing and meditation practices,and the cultivation of a nonjudgmental (mindful) awareness of bodysensations and thoughts ( Anderson & Sovik, 2000 ). Research with ageneral population sample in the United States has shown that yogais popular with young women, with some \ufb01ndings indicating greaterpopularity among non-Hispanic White, college educated women(Cramer et al., 2016a ), and other \ufb01ndings indicating popularityamong young women across ethnic, demographic, and socioeco-nomic status ( Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2020 ). These \ufb01ndings sug-gest that yoga may be an attractive form of adjunctive treatment foryoung women suffering from depression.Evidence for Mindful Yoga as aTreatment for DepressionBoth mindfulness and exercise are involved in yoga interventionsand both have been found to be effective treatments for symptoms ofdepression in young adults ( Bailey et al., 2018 ;Chi et al., 2018 ).Yoga interventions (including postures, breathing practices, andmeditation) have also been shown to reduce symptoms of depressionin young people ( Falsa \ufb01, 2016 ;Woolery et al., 2004 ). However,since these studies relied on participants with elevated levels ofsymptoms of depression instead of an actual diagnosis of MDD, it isdif\ufb01cult to know whether the bene \ufb01cial\ufb01ndings will generalize toyoung adults with MDD.Regarding the evidence for yoga interventions in adult populationswith MDD, a recent review that included 18 randomized controlledtrials (RCTs) with a total of 1,532 participants found mixed resultsregarding the intervention \u2019se f\ufb01cacy ( Vollbehr et al., 2018 ). Thisreview pointed to several potential reasons for the mixed \ufb01ndings,including methodological limitations such as small sample sizes (onlytwo studies included over a hundred participants, whereas sevenstudies had samples in the range of 50 \u2013100 participants and ninestudies included less than 50 participants). Further limitations ofprevious research include short follow-up periods (only sevenRCTs out of 18 used a follow-up, of which only three were 6 monthsor longer), and the absence of a manualized intervention (eight of the18 studies did not use a treatment manual). Another potential reasonfor the diverse \ufb01ndings may be the variability of control groups thatwere used. Speci \ufb01cally, yoga interventions showed a signi \ufb01cant effecton depression when compared to psychoeducation control groups, butnot when yoga was compared to treatment as usual (TAU). This mightbe because TAU offers a better active control to the extent that itconsists of interventions that have been found to be effective inreducing depression.However, the exact nature of TAU in these yoga trials is oftenunclear, which is more generally a problem for behavioral interven-tion research ( Freedland et al., 2011 ). Studies investigating yogainterventions in MDD patients who currently received some form ofstandard treatment are scarce \u2014we found only six such trials ( Broota& Dhir, 1990 ;Falsa\ufb01,2 0 1 6 ;Ravindran et al., 2021 ;Sarubin et al.,2014;Subbanna et al., 2021 ;Tolahunase et al., 2018 ). In\ufb01ve of thesetrials, TAU was limited to the use of medication ( Broota & Dhir,1990;Ravindran et al., 2021 ;Sarubin et al., 2014 ;Subbanna et al.,2021;Tolahunase et al., 2018 ). In one trial, only some of theparticipants received some form of TAU (medication or psychother-apy), and it was unclear whether these percentages differed betweenthe yoga and control group ( Falsa\ufb01,2 0 1 6 ). Clearly, then, the availabletrials offer limited potential in drawing conclusions about the bene \ufb01tsof adding a form of yoga to existing evidence-based treatment.In addition to studies that examined the bene \ufb01ts of adding yoga toTAU, other research has examined a standalone yoga interventionversus TAU control.

Email: n.vollbehr@lentis.nl926 VOLLBEHR ET AL.(Helgado \u00b4ttir et al., 2016 ). In this trial, about one-third of the controlgroup received antidepressant medication and about three-fourthsreceived a form of psychological treatment as standard treatment.Another design to examine yoga \u2019s effect on depression was used in atrial for women with prenatal depression ( Field et al., 2012 ). Thisstudy provided standard prenatal care to all participants and ran-domized half of these women into a yoga intervention. However,no speci \ufb01c form of treatment for depressive symptoms was offeredto the control group in Field et al. (2012) . The \ufb01ndings fromHelgado \u00b4ttir et al. (2016) andField et al. (2012) are dif \ufb01cult tointerpret because if only few (or no) participants received evidence-based TAU for MDD, these studies might be more likely to \ufb01ndpositive results for a yoga intervention ( Davidson & Kaszniak,2015 ). To arrive at more solid conclusions with regard to the clinicalrelevance of yoga-based treatment as standalone or add-on inter-vention, it would be critical to include a standard evidence-basedtreatment as control condition in the design ( Freedland et al., 2011 ).The present study was therefore designed as a RCT to test if theeffectiveness of a standard evidence-based intervention (TAU)would bene \ufb01t from adding a mindful yoga intervention (MYI) toTAU as an add-on intervention.Mechanisms of Mindful YogaOptimizing MDD interventions can be advanced through gainingknowledge about their mechanisms of action ( Kazdin, 2007 ). It isalso important to determine the conditions in which an interventionworks better, for instance, in distinct subgroups ( Kraemer et al.,2002 ). As there is a dearth of RCTs that study mediators andmoderators of yoga interventions ( Vollbehr et al., 2018 ), this studywas designed to address these questions.Theory suggests that mindful yoga could reduce depressivesymptoms by targeting mechanisms that are involved in the main-tenance of depression, including rumination ( Nolen-Hoeksema,2000 ), negative self-evaluation ( Auerbach et al., 2014 ), intoleranceof uncertainty ( Mahoney & McEvoy, 2012 ), interoceptive aware-ness ( Pollatos et al., 2009 ), and dispositional mindfulness ( Gilbert &Gruber, 2014 ). Speci \ufb01cally, mindful yoga includes shifting from anabstract thinking style to a concrete focus on body sensations andmight thereby reduce rumination ( Watkins, 2008 ). Mindful yogainstructions also involve a nonjudgmental attitude toward dif \ufb01cultsensations and self-critical thoughts during the yoga postures, whichcould help to reduce negative self-evaluation. Further, mindful yogamay reduce intolerance of uncertainty, as the training involvespractices to develop nonjudgmental awareness of challenging emo-tions and cognitions. Mindful yoga may also increase interoceptiveawareness as the intervention includes practices to develop aware-ness of bodily sensations. Last, given that we developed the currentmindful yoga intervention with a focus on developing a mindfulawareness of present moment experience, the training may alsoincrease dispositional mindfulness.Indeed, initial research has found evidence that yoga interventionsmay alter these \ufb01ve mechanisms, as yoga participants report lessrumination ( Kinser et al., 2014 ;Schuver & Lewis, 2016 ), more self-compassion ( Carmody & Baer, 2008 ), more body awareness ( Crameret al., 2016b ), and more mindfulness ( Carmody & Baer, 2008 ).Although there are no studies on mindful yoga interventions spe-ci\ufb01cally, recent research has shown evidence of intolerance ofuncertainty mediating the relation between mindfulness and reducedanxiety ( Papenfuss et al., 2021 ,2022 ). Regarding potential mod-erators, we did not \ufb01nd any studies investigating moderation in theef\ufb01cacy of yoga for MDD. However, in mindfulness research, levelof symptoms of depression and number of previous episodes havebeen found to moderate treatment effects ( Arch & Ayers, 2013 ).As positive affect has been found to be important in the recoveryfrom depression ( Geschwind et al., 2011 ), it is also important tostudy the effects of MDD interventions on well-being. Additionally,previous studies have found that even when symptoms of depressiondecrease, patients oftentimes continue to experience impairments invarious domains of functioning and quality of life ( Slofstra et al.,2019 ). It is therefore important to also take these types of variablesinto consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of interven-tions. Although there are initial indications that yoga might lead toenhanced well-being in healthy adults ( Hendriks et al., 2017 ), wefound only four clinical studies that measured aspects of well-being,impairment in various domains of functioning, or quality of life intheir outcome assessment. One RCT found no signi \ufb01cant differencein improvement in social relations in women with prenatal depres-sion after a 12-week yoga intervention, compared to a control groupof social support ( Field et al., 2013 ). Another study found nosigni\ufb01cant group difference between a 10-week yoga interventionin patients with persistent major depression compared to a controlgroup receiving health education regarding general health percep-tion and social and role functioning ( Uebelacker et al., 2017 ). Athird study found no signi \ufb01cant difference in quality of life after an8-week yoga intervention in patients with unipolar and bipolardepression compared to a control group of psychoeducation(Ravindran et al., 2021 ). Finally, one study found no group differ-ence between participants with MDD receiving an 8-week yoga orpsychoeducation intervention in mental health-related quality of lifeat 1-year follow-up ( Kinser et al., 2014 ). From these previousstudies, it remains rather unclear whether a yoga intervention canlead to an increase of various aspects of well-being or quality of life.Our study was therefore designed to also address these questions.The Present StudyStudy Aim and HypothesesThe overall objective of this study was to examine the potentialbene\ufb01ts of adding a MYI to TAU for young women with MDD. Ourhypotheses were that compared to TAU-only, MYI +TAU wouldlead to: (H1) greater reductions in depression symptoms, assessedwith clinician-administered and self-report measures, and (H2)greater increases in quality of life within various domains offunctioning, de \ufb01ned as (H2.1) daily functioning, (H2.2a) qualityof life, (H2.2b) quality of general health, and (H2.3) well-being. Inaddition, we tested if the anticipated bene \ufb01cial effects of MYI onsymptoms of depression are partially mediated by (H3.1) reducednegative perseverative cognition, (H3.2) reduced negative self-evaluation, (H3.3) decreased intolerance of uncertainty, (H3.4)increases in perceived body awareness/interoceptive awareness,and (H3.5) increased mindfulness. We also assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding MYI to TAU; these results will be publishedelsewhere.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.Content may be shared at no cost, but any requests to reuse this content in part or whole must go through the American Psychological Association.YOGA FOR YOUNG WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION 927Exploratory analyses were conducted to examine whether theeffects of MYI are moderated by demographic variables (e.g., socio-economic status), clinical factors (e.g., comorbidity), and variablesfrom the process evaluation (e.g., treatment adherence).MethodStudy Design and ParticipantsWe conducted a RCT with two conditions (TAU-only and MYI +TAU). This study protocol received ethical approval from the MedicalEthical Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen(Registration Number NL.59324.042.16/2016/533) and was con-ducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration ofHelsinki (Version 2013) and the Medical Research involving HumanSubjects Act (in Dutch: Wet medisch-wetenschappelijk onderzoekmet mensen). A more detailed description of the design, procedureand assessments is published elsewhere ( Vollbehr et al., 2020 ).This article has been prepared us ing the journal article reportingstandards-guidelines ( Appelbaum et al., 2018 ) and the ConsolidatedStandards of Reporting Trials guidelines ( Schulz et al., 2010 )f o rreporting a RCT. The study was preregistered at Clinical Trials(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ ) with number NCT03388177.We recruited 171 young women in ongoing treatment at severalpsychiatry outpatient clinics in the northern Netherlands. Inclusioncriteria were a primary diagnosis of MDD, age \u226518 and \u226434 years,and the ability to \ufb02uently read, write, and speak the Dutch language.Exclusion criteria were a current diagnosis of bipolar disorder orsubstance dependance, current psychotic symptoms, active suicid-ality, the unwillingness or inability to attend nine weekly sessions ofyoga, and a current regular yoga practice (average of \u226530 min perweek over the past 6 months).ProcedureRecruitment was from January 2017 to October 2018. Patients \u2019therapists prescreened potential participants on the inclusion andexclusion criteria and handed out an information package when apotential participant \ufb01t the study pro \ufb01le. After informed consent, theresearch assistant administered the structured interview for Diag-nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition(SCID-I; First et al., 2002 ) to verify the MDD diagnosis, and theinclusion and exclusion criteria, before inviting her to participate inthe trial. Serious adverse events were monitored by the yoga trainerduring the training (i.e., assessing whether participants experiencedinjuries or illness after or between sessions) and by the researchassistant during the study assessments (i.e., assessing whether anyimportant life events had happened during the study period).Further, at all assessment points participants completed question-naires that assessed whether they had experienced hospital admis-sions and, if so, for which conditions.Randomization and MaskingA methodologist from the Psychology Department of the Uni-versity of Groningen (CJA) was responsible for the randomizationof the participants, using a computerized random number generationprocess. The methodologist informed the contact person (i.e., aclinical psychology graduate student) of the assignment for eachpatient. The contact person then informed the participant regardingtreatment allocation.The research assistant assessed symptoms of depression at allassessments and was blinded to treatment allocation. For 11 parti-cipants, the blinding was broken (most common reasons were thatparticipants emailed about yoga training [ n=4], ran into theresearch assistant when doing the yoga training [ n=2], or spokeabout yoga during an interview [ n=2]). In these cases, theremaining assessments were done by another rater who was nototherwise involved in the study. We assessed the \ufb01delity of theblinding procedure and found that the research assistant guessedtreatment allocation correctly in less than 50% of cases at allassessments (T1: 45.9%, T2: 49.4%, T3: 40.0%), providing evi-dence for the adequacy of the rater blinding.Mindful Yoga InterventionMYI was delivered as a manualized 9-week group training with1.5-hr weekly sessions, designed to enhance awareness of bodilysensations, emotions and thoughts, and to change processes thatcontribute to depression. The intervention consisted of yogapostures, breathing practices, and meditation practices of tradi-tional hatha yoga ( Anderson & Sovik, 2000 ), combined withinstructions designed to increase mindful awareness. As no infor-mation about the best length of a yoga intervention is yet available(Sherman, 2012 ), we based the length and frequency of theintervention on similar mindfulness-based stress reduction andmindfulness-based cognitive therapy training protocols, whichare comparable interventions that have been found effective inreducing depression in adults ( Chiesa & Serretti, 2010 )a n dsymptoms of depression in young people, especially when thelength of the intervention is at least 8 weeks ( C h ie ta l . ,2 0 1 8 ). Ourintervention also matched the length and frequency of yoga inter-ventions for (mental) health conditions used in previous studies(Sherman, 2012 ). In addition, a pilot study with the currentintervention showed its feasibility for a patient population, asmost participants practiced daily (six out of eight participantspracticed daily for 15 \u201345 min; Vollbehr et al., 2021 ). The feasi-bility study \ufb01ndings also indicated that the intervention may berelated to the potential mediating mechanisms of repetitive nega-tive thinking, perceived body awareness, fear of emotion, andacting with awareness ( Vollbehr et al., 2021 ,2022 ).Between sessions, participants completed an online module thatincluded psychoeducation about depression, self-monitoring assign-ments, and videos for home practice (recommended time: 30 \u201345min a day). We encouraged participants to do home practice, as ameta-analysis of mindfulness intervention studies indicated that theamount of home practice showed a small but signi \ufb01cant associationwith intervention outcomes ( Parsons et al., 2017 ).Parsons et al.(2017) found that most participants practiced 30 min per day for6 days a week, which is in line with the \ufb01ndings from our feasibilitystudy. We therefore created home practice exercises of 30 \u201345 min.MYI was delivered by a psychologist (NKV) who is also a trainedyoga teacher (a Yoga Alliance Registered Yoga Teacher 500 withover 15 years of yoga experience and over 4 years of teachingexperience). More detailed information about the intervention hasbeen published elsewhere ( Vollbehr et al., 2020 ,2021 ). As the yogateacher was also involved as a researcher, she was not involved inrecruitment, screening, treatment allocation, or assessments.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.Content may be shared at no cost, but any requests to reuse this content in part or whole must go through the American Psychological Association.928 VOLLBEHR ET AL.Treatment as UsualTAU was delivered as individualized standard of care ( Freedlandet al., 2011 ) and was administered according to the Dutch TreatmentGuideline ( Spijker et al., 2012 ). A more detailed description of thisguideline and the treatment involved in the study can be found inSupplemental Materials . At the end of the study, the treatmentsreceived by participants were assessed from their medical \ufb01les,including additional diagnoses, interventions, medication, and num-ber of sessions. Information about additional diagnoses and TAUcan be found in Supplemental Materials . Brie \ufb02y, about half (54.1%)of the participants had another diagnosis in addition to MDD. Theother diagnosis was most often an anxiety disorder ( n=34) or apersonality disorder ( n=31). Mean treatment duration was 1 year(SD=1.17, range 0 \u201310). The majority of participants (51.8%)received more than one form of TAU, most often cognitive behav-ioral therapy ( n=114), other psychological treatments ( n=53),medication consultation ( n=46), or psychiatric nursing treatment(n=36). We did not restrict therapists from making changes duringthe study regarding (a) diagnosis, (b) medication, (c) interventions,or (d) \ufb01nishing the treatment. However, we did ask therapists to notadd an extra intervention to participants who were randomized inTAU-only to compensate for not receiving the yoga training.OutcomesAssessments took place (a) after informed consent and beforerandomization (T0), (b) after the last MYI session or the samenumber of weeks for the TAU condition (T1, about 10 \u201315 weeksafter T0), (c) 6 months after T1 (T2) and (d) 12 months afterT1 (T3). All questionnaires were in Dutch and were validated inthe Dutch language, except for the three items from the Multidi-mensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, for whichwe used our own translation, as no Dutch translation of this scalewas yet available. To assess interrater reliability of the clinician-administered interviews, we had an independent rater (not otherwiseinvolved in the study) assess 10% of these interviews at all assess-ment points.Descriptive MeasuresThe following demographic factors were assessed: age, level ofeducation (12 categories according to the Dutch educational sys-tem), relationship status (yes/no), employment status (yes/no),children (yes/no), and living situation (eight categories). Additionalfactors that could in \ufb02uence outcomes were also assessed, includingmotivation to participate in the study (scale range 1 \u20139,not motivatedtovery motivated ), rating of current TAU (scale range 1 \u201310,verylow quality tovery high quality ), expectation of success of the MYIin reducing depression symptoms (scale range 1 \u20139,not successful tovery successful ), and current yoga, meditation, and exercise practice(scale range 0 \u20135,nottoevery day ). Demographics were onlyassessed at baseline, whereas the other variables were assessed atall four assessment points.MDD HistoryInformation regarding previous episodes, start of current episode,and age at \ufb01rst episode were assessed using the SCID-I interview(First et al., 2002 ).Outcome MeasuresSeverity of depression was assessed with a clinician-administeredscale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; Hamilton,1960 ). The internal consistency was low at baseline and acceptableto good at the subsequent three assessment points ( \u03b1=.63 [T0]; .78[T1]; .84 [T2]; .85 [T3]). The interrater reliability was excellent at allassessment points (interclass correlation coef \ufb01cient =0.94 [T0];0.95 [T1]; 0.94 [T2]; 0.97 [T3]). We also used a self-report ques-tionnaire, the Depression scale of the Depression Anxiety StressScales\u2013short form (DASS-sf; Henry & Crawford, 2005 ;Lovibond &Lovibond, 1995 ). The internal consistency was good at all fourtime points ( \u03b1=.88 [T0]; .93 [T1]; .94 [T2]; .93 [T3]). Beforerandomization and at the last assessments point the presence/absenceof a diagnosis of MDD was assessed, using the SCID-I interview(First et al., 2002 ). The interrater reliability was good and excellent(Fleiss \u03ba=0.64 [before randomization]; 1.00 [T3]).Impairment across several situations was assessed with the Workand Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; Mundt et al., 2002 ). Theinternal consistency was low at baseline and good at the subsequentthree assessment points ( \u03b1=.62 [T0]; .85 [T1]; .89 [T2]; .91 [T3]).Psychological well-being was assessed with the Purpose and Per-sonal Growth scales of the Ryff Scales of Psychological Well-Being\u2013short form ( Ryff & Keyes, 1995 ). The internal consistencyfor both scales was acceptable to good at all four assessments(Purpose: \u03b1=.78 [T0]; .81 [T1]; .83 [T2]; .85 [T3]; Personalgrowth: \u03b1=.73 [T0]; .81 [T1]; .80 [T2]; .82 [T3]). Quality of lifewas assessed with two items from the World Health OrganizationQualitiy of Life Questionnaire \u2013BREF ( Harper & Power, 1998 ):(a) overall quality of life and (b) satisfaction with general health.MediatorsWe used self-report questionnaires for \ufb01ve potential mediators;rumination was assessed with the Perseverative Thinking Question-naire ( Ehring et al., 2011 ), which showed good internal consistency(\u03b1=.92 [T0]; .95 [T1]; .96 [T2]; .97 [T3]). Self-criticism andself-compassion were assessed with the Self-Compassion Scale(SCS; Neff, 2003 ), which showed good internal consistency ( \u03b1=.88 [T0]; .93 [T1]; .94 [T2]; .94 [T3]). Recent evidence has shownthat the SCS can best be used to measure two separate factors ofself-criticism and self-compassion instead of one bipolar construct(Lo\u00b4pez et al., 2015 ). We therefore analyzed these data usingthese two factors. Intolerance of uncertainty was assessed withthe Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale \u2013short form ( Carleton et al.,2007 ), which showed good internal consistency ( \u03b1=.84 [T0]; .89[T1]; .89 [T2]; .91 [T3]). Perceived body awareness was assessedwith the Awareness scale of the Scale of Body Connection ( Price &Thompson, 2007 ), which showed good internal consistency ( \u03b1=.82[T0]; .86 [T1]; .87 [T2]; .87 [T3]). To assess the trust-aspect ofbody awareness, we used three additional items of the Multidimen-sional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Scale ( Mehling et al.,2012 ), which demonstrated good internal consistency ( \u03b1=.86 [T0];.85 [T1]; .89 [T2]; .85 [T3]). Mindfulness was measured by theFive Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire ( Baer et al., 2006 ;Bohlmeijeret al., 2011 ), which showed acceptable to good internal consistency(\u03b1=.76 [T0]; .85 [T1]; .98 [T2]; .88 [T3]).Two additional mediators consisted of reaction time tasks. Theexogenous cueing task (ECT), based on Koster et al.

TheECT was programed with the E-prime 2.0 software package. Weused a Dutch version of the ECT that has been used in depressionresearch ( Elgersma et al., 2018 ,2019), with words that score high onsubjective familiarity in the Dutch language ( Hermans & Dehouwer,1994). Cues consisted of 10 depression-related, 10 positive, and 10neutral words that were selected based on representing depression-related, positive, and neutral categories (see Supplemental Materials ,for a complete description of the procedure of the ECT). Wecalculated the internal consistency of the ECT by calculating thesplit half reliability for the \ufb01rst and second half of the ECT for eachtype of trial as well as for the AB scores (calculation of the AB scorescan be found in \u201cData preparation, ECT analyses \u201d), as recommendedbyElgersma et al. (2019) . The Spearman \u2013Brown correlations werehigh for all types of trials, ranging from 0.75 (neutral valid) to 0.80(positive invalid) at T0, and from .74 (depressive valid/invalid andpositive valid) to 0.82 (neutral valid) at T1, indicating a good internalconsistency. The Spearman \u2013Brown correlations were low for theAB scores, ranging from 0.004 to 0.067 at T0 ( n=167), and from0.053 to 0.089 at T1 ( n=155).Depressive self-identity was assessed with the Implicit Associa-tion Test (IAT; Greenwald et al., 1998 ). A self-depressed IAT wasused to assess the strength of implicit self-depressed associations,based on Glashouwer et al. (2012) . Target categories consisted ofwords indicating self or other and attribute categories consisted ofdepression- or elated-related words. Each category consisted of \ufb01vestimuli (see Supplemental Materials , for a complete description ofthe IAT procedure). The IAT score was calculated using the D1algorithm from Greenwald et al. (2003) . Larger IAT scores indicateda relatively stronger self-depression (vs. self-elation) association.Internal consistency was assessed by creating two IAT scores (blocksc and f and blocks d and g). Split-half reliabilities of the IATs weregood, with Spearman \u2013Brown corrected correlations between testhalves of 0.77 at T0 ( n=169) and 0.77 at T1 ( n=155), whichis comparable to previous research ( Glashouwer & de Jong, 2010 ).Evaluation of the Yoga Intervention andTreatment Adherence/FidelityAfter the intervention, participants were asked to rate (a) to whatextent the MYI was successful in reducing their depression (range1\u20139,not successful tovery successful ), (b) the overall quality of thetraining, (d) the online module, and (e) the instructor (for these fouritems: range 1 \u201310,very low quality tovery high quality ). Partici-pants also rated the extent to which MYI had positive effects forthem with a 4-point scale of not,a little ,somewhat, anda lot.Treatment accuracy, consistency of the intervention, and quality ofthe teacher were assessed by having two independent raters observe arandom 10% of the group sessions. Raters were senior yoga teacherswith at least 5 years of yoga practice and 2 years of teachingexperience. They rated whether (a) the practices and postures weretaught as described in the manual and (b) a mindful cue was given ateach posture (e.g., a moment of silence, \u201cnotice, \u201d\u201cobserve \u201d). Therates also assessed the therapist \u2019s intervention skills (e.g., ability tomodel and embody the spirit of mindful yoga; being focused on thepresent moment, showing a nonjudgmental/accepting attitude towardparticipants), and use of mindful cues (e.g., extent to which thetherapist used mindful cues to elicit awareness of the present moment,acceptance of current experience and self-compassion) on a 5-pointscale ranging from 1 ( low)t o5( high). The teacher \u2019s competence (e.g.,overall quality of the intervention in this session delivered by theteacher), and quality of the yoga exercises during the session wererated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 ( not)t o5( excellent ). Thesequestions were adapted from a questionnaire designed to rate mind-fulness interventions ( Chawla et al., 2010 ).The mean of the two raters for treatment adherence was 97.7% forpostures and 95.6% for mindful cues given with the postures. Meanteacher \u2019s attitude was 4.50 and mean quality of the mindful cues was4.14. Competence of the teacher was rated with a mean of 4.04indicating good overall quality and the yoga exercises were ratedwith a mean of 3.84, also indicating good overall quality.Statistical AnalysesWe aimed for a sample of n=64 per condition to provide power of80% ( \u03b1=.05) to detect medium effect size differences for the primaryoutcome measures of symptoms of depression (Cohen \u2019sd=0.5;Cohen, 1988 ). We therefore recruited 171 participants (MYI +TAU:n=88, TAU: n=83), using a conservative attrition rate of 25%(comparable studies show rates of 15% \u201320%; Butler et al., 2008 ;Sarubin et al., 2014 ). At 12-month follow-up, we had n=77 (MYI +TAU) and n=70 (TAU) per group for our primary outcomemeasures. Power analysis using G *Power (Version 3.1.9.4; Faulet al., 2007 ) indicated that the current sample size provided astatistical power of 33% to detect small effect size differences,97% to detect medium effect size differences, and 100% to detectlarge effect size differences between conditions.All analyses were performed based on intention-to-treat. Missingdata on the outcome measures were handled using Multiple Impu-tation through Chained Equations (MICE; van Buuren, 2018a ).MICE uses linear regression to estimate missing values on variables,using the other variables as predictors, and logistic regression toestimate missing values on these variables. We had a maximum of11% (MYI +TAU) and 17% (TAU) missing for our primaryoutcome measures. The missing completely at random test wasnot signi \ufb01cant, indicating that our data were missing completely atrandom. We therefore decided to generate m=5 imputed data setsusing the Multiple Imputation Macro in SPSS 26.0 ( Van Buuren,2018b ). In order to reduce the number of variables in the data set, wecreated different data sets for the analyses of the primary outcomemeasures (12 variables), secondary outcome measures (23 vari-ables), mediators (34 variables), and moderators (111 variables).Due to missing data handling limitations in SPSS 26.0, the results ofthe analyses on the imputed data sets were manually converted intoone set of results, using an Excel datasheet. To ensure the accuracyof this conversion and the subsequent calculations, these werechecked by our methodologist (CJA).We also conducted per protocol analyses. For these analyses, weused three factors to determine which participants were selected forthe per protocol analyses. First, participants of both conditions wereincluded if they were still receiving TAU at T1. Second, participantsin the TAU-only condition were selected if they did not practiceyoga at T1. Third, participants in the MYI +TAU condition wereselected if they attended \u22655 of 9 MYI sessions ( Kuyken et al., 2010 ;Teasdale et al., 2000 ).We used IBM SPSS Statistics 26 for all analyses. Repeatedmeasures ANOVAs were used for the primary and secondaryhypotheses, with the values of the primary and secondary outcomeThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.Content may be shared at no cost, but any requests to reuse this content in part or whole must go through the American Psychological Association.930 VOLLBEHR ET AL.measures as dependent variables, condition as the between-subjectsfactor, and time (all four assessment points) as the within-subjectsfactor. Between-group effect sizes were calculated using \u03b72(Kelley, 1935 ). For the HDRS, we also assessed the minimalclinically important difference (MCID). Based on previous research(Hengartner & Ploederl, 2022 ), we set the MCID as a differenceof three points.Next, the mediation hypotheses were tested with 10,000 samplesbootstrapping regression model using the PROCESS macro forSPSS ( Hayes, 2012 ). We tested the indirect effects of condition(MYI +TAU vs. TAU) on all three primary outcome measures(baseline to follow-up) through the potential mediating variables(baseline to postintervention, nine variables in total) according to themethods suggested by Preacher and Hayes (2008) . We conducted atotal of 27 mediation analyses. Potential moderators were tested withregression analyses. We used regression analyses with a total of 132analyses, with change in the primary outcome measures from baselineto 12-month follow-up as dependent variable (except for the SCIDoutcome measure where we used diagnostic status at 12-months),and the interaction term of condition and the (standardized) potentialmoderating variable as moderator. We tested all potential modera-tors, including baseline depression information from the SCID(three variables; e.g., number of previous episodes), demographicvariables (six variables; e.g., age), rating of treatment, motivation,and expectations (three variables), clinical variables (six variables;e.g., additional diagnosis), primary and secondary outcome mea-sures at baseline (six variables), potential mediators at baseline (ninevariables), and TAU variables at baseline (11 variables; e.g., type oftreatment). Mediation and moderation analyses were per protocol.Data PreparationThe data of one participant (in MYI +TAU) were excluded fromall analyses because of having already completed treatment at thestart of the study (she had entered the study due to an error). Forseveral outcome measures, the assumption of normality was vio-lated. Yet, since the variance was equally distributed in both groups,we retained the planned analyses ( Ernst & Albers, 2017 ). As theLevene \u2019s test of variance was signi \ufb01cant for the SCID and DASSdepression outcomes at T3, we calculated the ratio of the variances.These values were between one and two (1.34 and 1.42) andtherefore not problematic for the analyses. In several cases, thesphericity assumption was violated (main analyses: HDRS, WSAS,quality of life and health, purpose and growth; per protocol analyses:HDRS, DASS). In these cases, we reported the Huyn-Feldt cor-rected results ( Howell, 2002 ).Analyses of the Exogenous Cueing Task (ECT)For MYI +TAU, there were n=84 remaining at T0 and n=82 atT1. For TAU, there were n=82 at T0 and n=72 at T1. Incorrectresponses were removed. After visual inspection of the data, asrecommended by Koster et al. (2005) and in line with previousstudies ( Elgersma et al., 2018 ,2019 ), reaction times (RTs) <200 msand RTs >1,000 ms were excluded as outliers, indicating anticipa-tory responding and distractions. A total of 97.68% (T0) and97.44% (T1) of data were used in the analyses. Median RTswere generated per individual, per type of trial (positive invalid,positive valid, depression invalid, depression valid, neutral invalid,neutral valid). We followed previous studies in using the median RT(rather than the mean) as it is a simple and robust way of dealing withpotential outliers (e.g., Elgersma et al., 2018 ,2019 ).We calculated a general AB score for depression, as recommendedbyMogg et al. (2008) and used in previous studies ( Elgersma et al.,2019), using the following formula:(See below)The general AB was scored such that larger values indicaterelatively greater AB for the depression stimuli.As recommended in similar studies ( Elgersma et al., 2019 ), scoresdeviating more than 3 SDs from the group mean were consideredoutliers. At T0, we found two outliers (one in each condition). AtT1 there were no outliers. We conducted analyses with and withoutthese outliers.Analyses of the Implicit Association TaskMean error rate was 6.10% for T0 ( SD=4.39 range 0% \u201333.8%),and 6.43 for T1 ( SD=4.70, range 0% \u201332.5%). There were noparticipants with more than 10% of trials below 300 ms, and noparticipants were found to have an unusual D-score ( >5SDfrommean), therefore no additional participants were excluded from theanalyses (e.g., Glashouwer & de Jong, 2010 ). At T0, there were n=86 remaining in MYI +TAU, and n=82 at T1. For TAU, thesewere n=82 at T0 and n=72 at T1.ResultsRecruitment, Attrition and Baseline CharacteristicsFigure 1 shows the participant \ufb02ow. A total of 171 participantswere randomized, of whom 88 received the MYI +TAU. Allparticipants completed baseline assessments of symptoms of depres-sion and 169 completed the demographic characteristics question-naires. At 12-month follow-up, in MYI +TAU n=77 (89%)completed the assessments and in TAU n=70 (84%). Table 1 showsan overview of the baseline demographic and clinical characteristicsof the participants for each condition (see Supplemental Materials ,for additional baseline characteristics). Mean level of clinician-rateddepression using the HDRS was 18.57 ( SD=5.94, range 7 \u201333),indicating moderate depression ( Zimmerman et al., 2013 ). Meanlevel of self-reported depression using the DASS was 21.11 ( SD=9.29, range 2 \u201342), indicating severe depression ( Lovibond &Lovibond, 1995 ). No serious adverse events related to the yogatraining were reported during the course of the study. Severalparticipants experienced serious adverse events unrelated to thestudy: hospitalization for already existing or acute physical injury orcondition (e.g., appendicitis or concussion from an accident; n=3[T1], n=5 [T2], n=6 [T3]); hospitalization for already existing oracute psychiatric condition ( n=1 [T2]).This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.Content may be shared at no cost, but any requests to reuse this content in part or whole must go through the American Psychological Association.AB score =\u00f0mean RT invalid depressive cue \u2212mean RT valid depressive cue \u00de\u2212\u00f0mean RT invalid neutral cue \u2212mean RT valid neutral cue \u00de:YOGA FOR YOUNG WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION 931This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.Content may be shared at no cost, but any requests to reuse this content in part or whole must go through the American Psychological Association.Figure 1Participant Recruitment and Flow Through the StudyRecruitment of patients via screening at outpatient centers ( n= 353)Invited to sign informed consent and for baseline screening interview ( n= 243)Excluded: Inclusion criteria not met or exclusion criteria applicable ( n= 16), scheduling issues for group sessions ( n= 8), not interested ( n= 2), nobaseline assessment ( n= 1)Randomized ( n= 171)Excluded: Did not want to be contacted (n= 103 )Completed baseline screening interview, check inclusion and exclusion criteria ( n= 198)Excluded: Inclusion criteria not met or exclusion criteria applicable ( n= 20), not interested ( n= 13),scheduling issues for group sessions (n= 12) Post-intervention:Lost to follow-up ( n= 6, 7a, 11b)Reasons: scheduling issues ( n= 1a/4b), no response ( n= 3), discontinued participation ( n= 3), technical problems ( n= 1b)TAU ( n= 83) TAU + MYI ( n= 88)Started intervention ( n= 86)Analyzed (intention to treat ) (n= 70, 69a)Analyzed (intention to treat ) (n= 78, 83a)Post-intervention:Lost to follow-up (n = 0, 1, 4b)Reasons: scheduling issues ( n= 1/3b), technical problems (n= 1b)Completed intervention (\u2265 5 sessions )(n= 69)Reasons: scheduling issues ( n= 1), did not want to do yoga (n= 1)Reasons: scheduling issues ( n= 7), insufficient motivation ( n= 6), injury ( n= 1), vacation ( n= 1), missed too many sessions for various reasons ( n=1), unknown ( n= 1)Initial contact to provide information (n= 250 )Excluded: Unable to contact(n= 7)Excluded ( n= 1)Reason: did not receive TAU 6-month follow-up:Lost to follow-up ( n= 3, 4a)Reasons: scheduling issues ( n= 1), no response ( n= 2/3a)6-month follow-up:Lost to follow-up ( n= 8, 11a)Reasons: no response ( n= 4/7a), discontinued participation (n= 4)12-month follow-up:Lost to follow-up ( n= 9, 4a)Reasons: no response ( n= 4/3a), technical problems ( n= 3), unknown ( n= 2/1a)12-month follow-up:Lost to follow-up (n = 13, 14a)Reasons: no response ( n= 7/10a), discontinued participation ( n= 4)Note.

A minority reported three or moreprevious episodes ( n=33). For the majority of participants, thecurrent episode started more than 2 years ago ( n=55), or betweenone and 2 years ago ( n=54). The mean age at the start of the \ufb01rstepisode was 18 years ( SD=5.24, range 6 \u201333).At T1, \ufb01ve participants (3%) had completed treatment. Meannumber of received sessions of the participants still in treatmentwas 9.67 ( SD=6.15, range 0 \u201338). Sixty-one additional participants(37%) had completed treatment at T2. Of the participants still intreatment, the mean number of sessions was 17.97 ( SD=12.69, range0\u201374). At T3, another 23 participants (22.3%) had completed theirtreatment. Of the participants still in treatment, mean number ofcontacts was 16.10 ( SD=9.85, range 0 \u201348). There were no groupdifferences on any of these variables ( ps>.315), except for the ratingof the current treatment, with participants in MYI +TAU being moresatis\ufb01ed about their treatment ( M=7.69, SD=0.86, range 6 \u20139)compared to participants in TAU ( M=7.09, SD=1.21, range 4 \u20139),F(1, 68) =5.81, p=0.019, with an effect size of Cohen \u2019sd=0.32.Intervention and Yoga PracticeOf the 88 participants who were randomized into MYI +TAU, 86started the intervention and 69 (79%) completed at least \ufb01ve sessions.Most common reasons for noncompletion were scheduling issues(n=8) and insuf \ufb01cient motivation ( n=6). Mean number of attendedsessions was six ( SD=2.38, range 0 \u20139). After the intervention, thequality of the MYI was rated with a mean score of 7.7 ( SD=1.42,range 4 \u201310), the online module with 6.5 ( SD=1.98, range 1 \u201310),and the teacher with 8.8 ( SD=1.17, range 5 \u201310). Most participantsindicated that they experienced some ( n=27, 34%), followed byquite some ( n=25, 31%) and a lot ( n=15, 19%) of positive effectsof the training. Thirteen participants (16%) indicated they did notexperience positive effects.Postintervention, MYI participants indicated that they practicedyoga once a week ( n=28), 2\u20133 times a week ( n=19), 1\u20132 times amonth ( n=15), and less than once a month ( n=8). Fifteenparticipants (17%) did not practice at all. Data regarding the use ofthe online module during the MYI were taken from track records ofthe online system. Mean number of completed online sessions was3.6 (SD=3.1, range 0 \u20139). Eighteen participants did not completeany session. Four completed all nine sessions.Six months after the intervention, 58% of the MYI participantsreported that they continued to practice yoga, at the frequency of lessthan once a month ( n=22), once a week ( n=12), once or twice amonth ( n=10), or 2 \u20133 times per week ( n=5). At the 12-monthassessment, 56% of participants re ported they were still practicingyoga, at the frequency of less than once a month ( n=18), once or twiceam o n t h( n=13), once a week ( n=13) or 2 \u20133 times per week ( n=3).In the control group, several participants started to practice yoga overthe course of the study ( n=9a tT 1 ; n=7a tT 2 ; n=9a tT 3 ) .CorrelationsWe correlated all variables assessing yoga practice, completednumber of sessions of the MYI and online module, expectations,positive effects, evaluation of the training, online module andthe teacher with change on the primary outcome measures fromT0 to T3.

From T0 to T3 theMYI +TAU group showed a mean reduction of 11.42 points, and theTAU group of 10.17 points. This is a mean difference of 1.25 points,which does not meet the preset level of MCID.Figure 4 shows the change in scores on the secondary outcomemeasures. Repeated measures ANOVAs were run for each measurewith time (T0, T1, T2, and T3) as a within factor and group (MYI +TAU vs. TAU-only) as a between factor. The results showed (a) noeffects for the MYI +TAU over TAU, in that there were nosigni\ufb01cant interaction effects between group and time for impairmentacross several situations, quality of life, satisfaction with health,purpose and growth ( ps>.12) but (b) main effects of time for allvariables ( ps<.001). Together, these results indicated that bothgroups showed increases in general functioning, but that MYI +TAUdid not demonstrate greater increases than TAU alone.MediatorsAs indirect effects can occur even in the absence of main effects(Hayes, 2013 ), we performed per protocol regression analyses foreach of the potential mediators on all three primary outcome mea-sures. We did not \ufb01nd indirect effects for any of the mediationanalyses (all con \ufb01dence intervals included zero, see SupplementalMaterials ), except for self-compassion on the self-reported symptomsof depression outcome measure (DASS). A bias-corrected bootstrap95% con \ufb01dence interval for the indirect effect (1.56) based on 10,000bootstrap samples did not include zero (.58 \u20135.02), indicating media-tion of self-compassion at 12-months follow-up. Of interest in regardsto whether the MYI had expected yoga-related effects, the analysesshowed a group difference in change from baseline to postinterven-tion in self-compassion, F(1, 135) =6.27, p=0.02 ( \u03b72=0.04) andperceived body awareness, F(1, 135) =9.89, p=0.0022 ( \u03b72=0.07),with for both variables participants in the MYI +TAU groupreporting a larger increase compared to participants in the TAU-only group, but not in the other mediators ( ps\u2265.20).ModeratorsWe conducted exploratory analyses to examine potential mod-erators of the intervention using per protocol analyses. We did not\ufb01nd substantial evidence for any of the potential moderators (i.e.,showing a signi \ufb01cant interaction effect on at least two out of threeprimary outcome measures).DiscussionSummary of the Main FindingsTo our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst RCT to investigate the ef \ufb01cacyof adding a MYI to TAU in young women with depression and tostudy potential mediators and moderators of the MYI effects.Regarding our primary hypothesis, compared to TAU-only, addingMYI to TAU did not result in a larger decrease of symptoms ofdepression at postintervention or follow-up or in fewer MDDdiagnosis at 12-month follow-up. The \ufb01ndings showed that therewas a 1.25-point difference between the conditions in decline on theHamilton depression measure at 12-months follow-up, which isroughly half the 3-point criterion for a minimal clinically relevantdifference ( Hengartner & Ploederl, 2022 ).The results also did not support our secondary hypothesis, as wedid not \ufb01nd that adding MYI to TAU led to larger increases of well-being and general functioning. The third hypothesis was mostlyunsupported as we did not \ufb01nd any of the candidate mediatingvariables to mediate the relation between condition and outcomes,except for self-compassion on self-reported symptoms of depres-sion. Further, the moderation analyses did not support a role for anyof the potential moderators.Comparing the Current Findings WithPrevious ResearchOur\ufb01ndings are in line with previous studies that have comparedyoga with TAU on depression outcomes in clinical samples. Con-sistent with the majority of these studies ( Vollbehr et al., 2018 ),we did not \ufb01nd a signi \ufb01cant difference between MYI +TAU andTAU-only in reducing depression. As most of the previous researchhad methodological shortcomings such as small sample sizes, shortfollow-up periods, and the absence of a manualized intervention, thevalidity of the previous results may have been suboptimal. One waythat the present study contributes to the literature is by addressingthese methodological issues with design elements such as using aclinical sample, a large sample size, having a blinded rater, admin-istering the intervention with a manual, and using a control condi-tion of evidence-based interventions. The improved design elementsmake the current results more reliable and increase con \ufb01dence intheir interpretation with regard to the clinical value of adding MYI toTAU. Further, our study is one of the few trials that has examinedthe effectiveness of a yoga intervention for MDD in a clinicalsetting, as most studies have used community samples ( Vollbehret al., 2018 ).This study examined the ef \ufb01cacy of MYI by adding it to TAU foryoung women with MDD. Regarding the addition of a yogaintervention to TAU, we found six other studies that comparedThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.Content may be shared at no cost, but any requests to reuse this content in part or whole must go through the American Psychological Association.Figure 3Bar Graph of Percentage of Participants Meeting MDD Diagnosisat 12-Month Follow-UpNote.M D D =major depressive disorder; TAU =treatment as usualgroup; MYI =mindful yoga intervention group Error bars represent onestandard error.YOGA FOR YOUNG WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION 935TAU-only with yoga plus TAU ( Broota & Dhir, 1990 ;Falsa \ufb01, 2016 ;Ravindran et al., 2021 ;Sarubin et al., 2014 ;Subbanna et al., 2021 ;Tolahunase et al., 2018 ). Two of these studies had similar \ufb01ndings toours with no group differences between the yoga group and thecontrol group ( Ravindran et al., 2021 ;Sarubin et al., 2014 ). Theother four studies found a signi \ufb01cant difference in decrease ofsymptoms of depression in favor of the yoga group ( Broota &Dhir, 1990 ;Falsa \ufb01, 2016 ;Subbanna et al., 2021 ;Tolahunase et al.,2018 ). A potential explanation for the discrepancy with our \ufb01ndingsmight relate to differences in the TAU that was offered to theparticipants. In our study, all participants received an individualizedstandard form of TAU that could include medication as well as otherforms of treatment, while in three out of four of the other studies theonly treatment allowed was psychiatric medication ( Broota & Dhir,1990 ;Subbanna et al., 2021 ;Tolahunase et al., 2018 ), and in onestudy, only part of the participants received actual treatment (56.6%medication and 22.4% psychotherapy; Falsa \ufb01, 2016 ). Intensity ofintervention is another potential reason for the positive \ufb01ndings inthe other studies. Compared to the 1.5 hr/session a week for 9 weeksin the present study, the studies with positive \ufb01ndings all had moreintensive interventions \u2014three 20 \u201330-min sessions in 3 days inBroota and Dhir (1990) , 2 hr/session, \ufb01ve sessions per week for12 weeks in Tolahunase et al. (2018) , or four-to-six 1-hr sessions perweek for 3 months in Subbanna et al. (2021) . Another indication ofthe less intensive nature of our intervention is that the participantsshowed relatively low amounts of home practice.Several other studies that compared a yoga intervention to variouscontrol conditions have found positive results as well ( Butler et al.,2008 ;Field et al., 2012 ,2013 ;Mitchell et al., 2012 ;Prathikanti et al.,2017 ;Schuver & Lewis, 2016 ;Uebelacker et al., 2015 ). However,most of these studies used a psychoeducation control group ( Butleret al., 2008 ;Field et al., 2012 ,2013 ;Mitchell et al., 2012 ;Prathikantiet al., 2017 ;Uebelacker et al., 2015 ), controlling only for nonspe-ci\ufb01c factors. In contrast, yoga interventions have generally not beenfound to be more effective in reducing depression when compared toactive control groups such as mindfulness training ( Falsa \ufb01, 2016 ),massage therapy ( Field et al., 2012 ), or walking ( Schuver & Lewis,2016 ). To summarize, our nonsigni \ufb01cant\ufb01ndings are in line withmost other yoga intervention studies that used a strong (active)comparison condition.It may be informative to also compare our \ufb01ndings with studiesthat investigated mindfulness-based interventions for patients withacute MDD using the addition of mindfulness interventions to TAU,compared to TAU alone. These studies have generally found asigni\ufb01cant decrease of symptoms of depression in the interventiongroup plus TAU compared to the TAU-only group ( Barnhofer et al.,2009 ;Kingston et al., 2007 ;Omidi et al., 2013 ;van Aalderen et al.,2012 ). However, as in most yoga intervention studies, the exactnature of TAU was either unclear ( Kingston et al., 2007 ;vanAalderen et al., 2012 ) or was restricted to the use of antidepressantmedication without psychological treatments ( Barnhofer et al.,2009 ;Omidi et al., 2013 ). Therefore, it is possible that in thesemindfulness studies the TAU control was weaker than the TAUreceived by all participants in the present study, which consisted of avariety of interventions recommended by the Dutch guidelines.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.Content may be shared at no cost, but any requests to reuse this content in part or whole must go through the American Psychological Association.Figure 4Bar Graphs of the Difference Scores on the General Functioning(Top), Quality of Life and Health (Middle) and Purpose andGrowth (Bottom) Secondary Outcome Measures From Baselineto Postintervention, 6-Month, and 12-Month Follow-UpNote. TAU =treatment as usual group; MYI =mindful yoga interventiongroup. Error bars represent one standard error; FU =Follow-up.936 VOLLBEHR ET AL.As most participants in the present study received more than onetype of recommended intervention, including psychological treat-ment such as cognitive behavioral therapy ( n=114) or otherpsychological interventions ( n=53), it might have been the casethat TAU in the present study was already rather complete and thatthe MYI has not been able to add much \u2014for example due to nothaving enough time or energy to dedicate to the MYI practices.Considering our \ufb01ndings for the general functioning and qualityof life outcomes, we found three studies investigating a yogaintervention that also assessed these positive outcomes in patientswith depression. None of these studies found differences betweenyoga and psychoeducation control on mental health quality of life(Kinser et al., 2014 ), social and role functioning, and general healthperception ( Uebelacker et al., 2017 ), or quality of life ( Ravindranet al., 2021 ). Our null- \ufb01ndings for the secondary outcome measuresare thus in line with these previous \ufb01ndings.Finally, regarding potential mechanisms of the yoga intervention,the results did not indicate mediating effects of any of the potentialvariables, except for self-compassion on self-reported symptoms ofdepression. Although we could not \ufb01nd any other yoga for depres-sion studies that assessed mediation, we did \ufb01nd three studies thatassessed yoga effects on potential mediating mechanisms. First,Falsa \ufb01(2016) found that a yoga intervention led to more mindful-ness compared to wait-list control, but not when compared to amindfulness intervention. Also, the yoga intervention did not lead tomore self-compassion, compared to wait-list or mindfulness control.Second, Prathikanti et al. (2017) used self-ef \ufb01cacy and self-worthscales and found that there was no signi \ufb01cant difference between theyoga and control group of psychoeducation on these scales. Last,Schuver and Lewis (2016) used a rumination scale and found asigni\ufb01cant group difference in favor of the yoga group postinter-vention, compared to walking control, but not at the 1-month follow-up. A potential reason for the discrepancy between our null- \ufb01ndingsfor rumination and the \ufb01ndings of Schuver and Lewis (2016) is thatthey used a walking intervention control whereas our study usedTAU, which likely contained elements that targeted rumination(such as cognitive behavioral therapy). The type of control groupmight also explain the difference between our study and the \ufb01ndingsofFalsa \ufb01(2016) for a change in mindfulness \u2014we used actualevidence-based interventions as control where in the Falsa \ufb01(2016)study a wait-list control was used and only part of the participantsreceived evidence-based treatment.Although there was only one statistically signi \ufb01cant mediationeffect, the results did indicate main effects in favor of the MYI leadingto increased self-compassion and perceived body awareness. Theseresults may indicate evidence for MYI as an active intervention.These \ufb01ndings show that while it appears that there is some evidencethat the MYI did what it was intended to do (increase of self-compassion and perceived body awareness), these effects did notact as mediators of MYI on depression, with the above notedexception of self-compassion on self-reported depression symptoms.Strengths and LimitationsThe present study has a number of methodological elements thatadd con \ufb01dence to the results. First, we preregistered our study anddesigned a rigorous trial, adhering to the Consolidated Standardsof Reporting Trials guidelines. Second, we were able to include arelatively large sample within mental health institutions that showedlow attrition even at 12-month follow-up (15%, whereas comparablestudies showed 29% attrition at 6 months; Uebelacker et al., 2017or 67% at 1 year; Kinser et al., 2014 ). Our ability to include andretain this sample helped to provide adequate power for detectingmedium to large effect size differences. Third, we used clinician-administered measures to assess symptoms of depression (whichshowed excellent interrater reliability), thereby augmenting the self-report measures. Fourth, our rater blinding was found to be valid,helping to prevent rater bias and increase con \ufb01dence in the validityof the clinician-administered measures of depression. This is notableas we found no other RCTs studying yoga interventions for depres-sion that adequately assessed rater blinding ( Vollbehr et al., 2018 ).Fifth, we used a relatively long follow-up period of 1 year, making itpossible to also draw longer term conclusions, and not only con-clusions right after \ufb01nishing treatment. Given that a critique ofprevious research is that due to a lack of longer term follow-upassessments, even when bene \ufb01ts of a yoga intervention are found, itis unclear whether they are lasting ( Vollbehr et al., 2018 ). With thislonger follow-up, we are able to give better information aboutwhether initial bene \ufb01ts are lasting. Sixth, we conducted a thoroughassessment of TAU through review of participants \u2019medical \ufb01les.This provided knowledge regarding what evidence-based interven-tions were used in TAU and helped to ensure that our control groupwas a strong comparison. This point is important because a weakTAU may lead to overestimations of the added value of the targettreatment ( Baskin et al., 2003 ). Seventh, we assessed treatmentadherence of the yoga teacher, who was found to closely follow themanual by independent raters and received good ratings on qualityand attitude by the participants. Finally, we assessed whether theyoga intervention was doing what it was designed to do by analyzinggroup differences on the potential mediators for the MYI completersand TAU group from baseline to postintervention. The resultsshowed that the MYI indeed led to more self-compassion andperceived body awareness. This is a strength of the study asmost other yoga intervention studies have not examined whetherthe intervention is active in the sense of in \ufb02uencing targetedmechanisms.In addition to the strengths listed above, several limitations arerelevant for interpreting the \ufb01ndings. First, participants in bothconditions received evidence- and guideline-based specializedcare, which might have hampered the additional effect of MYIfor reasons such as having less time and energy for devoting to theyoga home practices. Perhaps related, participants generally didnot complete the home practice. The MYI was designed to includean online module to facilitate the practice of exercises for at least30\u201345 min per day, but none of the participants practiced this often;the majority practiced once a week or less. Although this suboptimalcompletion of the intervention might have prevented strongerbene\ufb01ts, this interpretation may not be the best one as correlationbetween amount of practice and change in the primary outcomesmeasures was not signi \ufb01cant. Finally, this study was designed toenhance MDD treatment for young women, as they are especially atrisk for developing MDD. However, the sample also means that thegeneralizability of our \ufb01ndings is limited to young women sufferingfrom clinical depression, as we did not include men or older adultsin the sample. This limitation may be important as research hasshown that meditation interventions have different effects for menand women ( Rojiani et al., 2017 ), and that psychotherapeuticinterventions have shown larger effects sizes in adults comparedThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.Content may be shared at no cost, but any requests to reuse this content in part or whole must go through the American Psychological Association.YOGA FOR YOUNG WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION 937to adolescents ( Cuijpers et al., 2020 ). Also, as the participantsconsisted of young women in the northern part of the Netherlands,the sample had relatively little ethnic diversity, which may limit thegeneralizability of the results.Recommendations for Clinical Practice andFuture ResearchFindings that yoga is a popular practice among young women(Cramer et al., 2016a ;Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2020 ) were sup-ported in our study, as participants positively evaluated MYI as aform of treatment. This suggests that MYI may be bene \ufb01cial foroptimizing the attractiveness of treatment. Additional research mayprovide information regarding whether other groups such as theelderly or populations with chronic mood and anxiety disordersbene\ufb01t more strongly from MYI. Further, given that the mean groupdifference of 1.25 is nearly half of the MCID and in the expecteddirection, there may be subgroups of young women with MDD thatderive greater bene \ufb01t from MYI. Clinical practice would bene \ufb01tfrom research that determines such subgroups. Finally, it is possiblethat MYI may be more helpful when patients are recovered and havethe energy and psychological resources that allow for more com-mitted practice. From this perspective, future research may bene \ufb01tfrom examining the potential of MYI as a relapse preventiontreatment.ReferencesAnderson, S., & Sovik, R. (2000). Yoga. Mastering the basics .
