Method: Randomized controlled trial (RCT; n = 171) comparing TAU + MYI with TAU-only.\nAssessments were at baseline, postintervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Primary outcome\n‘measures were clinician-rated and self-reported symptoms of depression, together with a diagnostic interview\n0 establish MDD diagnosis that was restricted to the baseline and 12-month follow-up assessments. Quality\nof life in various domains was assessed as secondary outcome measure. As potential mediators for treatment\nefficacy, we included self-report measures of rumination, self-criticism, self-compassion, intolerance of\nuncertainty, perceived body awareness and dispositional mindfulness, together with behavioral measures of\nattentional bias (AB) and depression-related self-associations. Results: Adding MYI to TAU did not lead to\ngreater reduction of depression symptoms, lower rate of MDD diagnosis or increase in quality of life in\nvarious domains of functioning at post and follow-up assessments. There were no indirect effects through any\nof the potential mediators, with the exception of self-compassion.

It is estimated that women\nare two times more likely to develop major depressive disorder\n(MDD) than men during their lives (Bromet et al., 2011), and young\nwomen (aged 18-34) are especially at high risk of developing\nMDD (De Graaf et al., 2012). Although a small majority of patients\neventually receives treatment during their lifetime (57%; Rubio\netal, 2011), these patients often do not respond (fully) to treatment.\nFor example, research has shown that only about 50% respond to\npsychotherapy and medication treatment (Casacalenda et al., 2002).\nFurther, a substantial number (about 40%) continues to experience\nresidual symptoms (Conradi et al., 2011) and relapse rates are high\n1-2 years posttreatment (26%-43%; Steinert et al., 2014). From\nthese data, it becomes clear that there is a need to further optimize\ntreatment as usual for MDD.\n\nOne way to enhance the efficacy of treatment is to offer a\ncombination of interventions. For instance, there is evidence that\na combination of medication and psychotherapy was more effective\nthan medication alone (Karyotaki et al., 2016). Similarly, adjunctive\ninterventions such as relaxation, creative expression therapy, exer-\ncise, and mindfulness-based interventions show potential in opti-\n‘mizing standard treatment for acute depression or relapse prevention\n(Spijker et al., 2012). One intervention that offers a combination of\n‘mindfulness and exercise is mindful yoga, a mind-body practice\nconsisting of physical postures, breathing and meditation practices,\nand the cultivation of a nonjudgmental (mindful) awareness of body\nsensations and thoughts (Anderson & Sovik, 2000). Research with a\ngeneral population sample in the United States has shown that yoga\nis popular with young women, with some findings indicating greater\npopularity among non-Hispanic White, college educated women\n(Cramer et al, 2016a), and other findings indicating popularity\namong young women across ethnic, demographic, and socioeco-\nnomic status (Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2020). These findings sug-\ngest that yoga may be an attractive form of adjunctive treatment for\nyoung women suffering from depression.\n\nEvidence for Mindful Yoga as a\nTreatment for Depression\nBoth mindfulness and exercise are involved in yoga interventions\n\nand both have been found to be effective treatments for symptoms of\ndepression in young adults (Bailey et al., 2018; Chi et al., 2018).\n\nVOLLBEHR ET AL.\n\nYoga interventions (including postures, breathing practices, and\nmeditation) have also been shown to reduce symptoms of depression\nin young people (Falsafi, 2016; Woolery et al., 2004). However,\nsince these studies relied on participants with elevated levels of\nsymptoms of depression instead of an actual diagnosis of MDD, it is\ndifficult to know whether the beneficial findings will generalize to\nyoung adults with MDD.\n\nRegarding the evidence for yoga interventions in adult populations\nwith MDD, a recent review that included 18 randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs) with a total of 1,532 participants found mixed results\nregarding the intervention’s efficacy (Vollbehr et al, 2018). This\nreview pointed to several potential reasons for the mixed findings,\nincluding methodological limitations such as small sample sizes (only\ntwo studies included over a hundred participants, whereas seven\nstudies had samples in the range of 50-100 participants and nine\nstudies included less than 50 participants). Further limitations of\nprevious research include short follow-up periods (only seven\nRCTs out of 18 used a follow-up, of which only three were 6 months\nor longer), and the absence of a manualized intervention (eight of the\n18 studies did not use a treatment manual). Another potential reason\nfor the diverse findings may be the variability of control groups that\nwere used. Specifically, yoga interventions showed a significant effect\non depression when compared to psychoeducation control groups, but\nnot when yoga was compared to treatment as usual (TAU). This might\nbe because TAU offers a better active control to the extent that it\nconsists of interventions that have been found to be effective in\nreducing depression.\n\nHowever, the exact nature of TAU in these yoga trials is often\nunclear, which is more generally a problem for behavioral interven-\ntion research (Freedland et al, 2011). Studies investigating yoga\ninterventions in MDD patients who currently received some form of\nstandard treatment are scarce—we found only six such trials (Broota\n& Dhir, 1990; Falsafi, 2016; Ravindran et al., 2021; Sarubin et al.,\n2014; Subbanna et al., 2021; Tolahunase et al., 2018). In five of these\ntrials, TAU was limited to the use of medication (Broota & Dhir,\n1990; Ravindran et al., 2021; Sarubin et al., 2014; Subbanna et al.,\n2021; Tolahunase et al., 2018). In one trial, only some of the\nparticipants received some form of TAU (medication or psychother-\napy), and it was unclear whether these percentages differed between\nthe yoga and control group (Falsafi, 2016). Clearly, then, the available\ntrials offer limited potential in drawing conclusions about the benefits\nof adding a form of yoga to existing evidence-based treatment.\n\nIn addition to studies that examined the benefits of adding yoga to\nTAU, other research has examined a standalone yoga intervention\nversus TAU control. We found only one such study using this design\n\nediting. Agna A.

In this trial, about one-third of the control\ngroup received antidepressant medication and about three-fourths\nreceived a form of psychological treatment as standard treatment.\nAnother design to examine yoga’s effect on depression was used in a\ntrial for women with prenatal depression (Field et al., 2012). This\nstudy provided standard prenatal care to all participants and ran-\ndomized half of these women into a yoga intervention. However,\nno specific form of treatment for depressive symptoms was offered\nto the control group in Field et al. (2012). The findings from\nHelgaddttir et al. (2016) and Field et al. (2012) are difficult to\ninterpret because if only few (or no) participants received evidence-\nbased TAU for MDD, these studies might be more likely to find\npositive results for a yoga intervention (Davidson & Kaszniak,\n2015). To arrive at more solid conclusions with regard to the clinical\nrelevance of yoga-based treatment as standalone or add-on inter-\nvention, it would be critical to include a standard evidence-based\ntreatment as control condition in the design (Freedland et al., 2011).\nThe present study was therefore designed as a RCT to test if the\neffectiveness of a standard evidence-based intervention (TAU)\nwould benefit from adding a mindful yoga intervention (MYT) to\nTAU as an add-on intervention.\n\nMechanisms of Mindful Yoga\n\nOptimizing MDD interventions can be advanced through gaining\nknowledge about their mechanisms of action (Kazdin, 2007). It is\nalso important to determine the conditions in which an intervention\nworks better, for instance, in distinct subgroups (Kraemer et al.,\n2002). As there is a dearth of RCTs that study mediators and\n‘moderators of yoga interventions (Vollbehr et al., 2018), this study\nwas designed to address these questions.\n\nTheory suggests that mindful yoga could reduce depressive\nsymptoms by targeting mechanisms that are involved in the main-\ntenance of depression, including rumination (Nolen-Hoeksema,\n2000), negative self-evaluation (Auerbach et al., 2014), intolerance\nof uncertainty (Mahoney & McEvoy, 2012), interoceptive aware-\nness (Pollatos et al., 2009), and dispositional mindfulness (Gilbert &\nGruber, 2014). Specifically, mindful yoga includes shifting from an\nabstract thinking style to a concrete focus on body sensations and\n‘might thereby reduce rumination (Watkins, 2008). Mindful yoga\ninstructions also involve a nonjudgmental attitude toward difficult\nsensations and self-critical thoughts during the yoga postures, which\ncould help to reduce negative self-evaluation. Further, mindful yoga\nmay reduce intolerance of uncertainty, as the training involves\npractices to develop nonjudgmental awareness of challenging emo-\ntions and cognitions. Mindful yoga may also increase interoceptive\nawareness as the intervention includes practices to develop aware-\nness of bodily sensations. Last, given that we developed the current\n‘mindful yoga intervention with a focus on developing a mindful\nawareness of present moment experience, the training may also\nincrease dispositional mindfulness.\n\nIndeed, initial research has found evidence that yoga interventions\nmay alter these five mechanisms, as yoga participants report less\nrumination (Kinser et al., 2014; Schuver & Lewis, 2016), more self-\ncompassion (Carmody & Baer, 2008), more body awareness (Cramer\net al, 2016b), and more mindfulness (Carmody & Baer, 2008).\nAlthough there are no studies on mindful yoga interventions spe-\ncifically, recent research has shown evidence of intolerance of\n\n927\n\nuncertainty mediating the relation between mindfulness and reduced\nanxiety (Papenfuss et al, 2021, 2022). Regarding potential mod-\nerators, we did not find any studies investigating moderation in the\nefficacy of yoga for MDD. However, in mindfulness research, level\nof symptoms of depression and number of previous episodes have\nbeen found to moderate treatment effects (Arch & Ayers, 2013).\nAs positive affect has been found to be important in the recovery\nfrom depression (Geschwind et al., 2011), it is also important to\nstudy the effects of MDD interventions on well-being. Additionally,\nprevious studies have found that even when symptoms of depression\ndecrease, patients oftentimes continue to experience impairments in\nvarious domains of functioning and quality of life (Slofstra et al.,\n2019). It is therefore important to also take these types of variables\ninto consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of interven-\ntions. Although there are initial indications that yoga might lead to\nenhanced well-being in healthy adults (Hendriks et al., 2017), we\nfound only four clinical studies that measured aspects of well-being,\nimpairment in various domains of functioning, or quality of life in\ntheir outcome assessment. One RCT found no significant difference\nin improvement in social relations in women with prenatal depres-\nsion after a 12-week yoga intervention, compared to a control group\nof social support (Field et al, 2013). Another study found no\nsignificant group difference between a 10-week yoga intervention\nin patients with persistent major depression compared to a control\ngroup receiving health education regarding general health percep-\ntion and social and role functioning (Uebelacker et al., 2017). A\nthird study found no significant difference in quality of life after an\n8-week yoga intervention in patients with unipolar and bipolar\ndepression compared to a control group of psychoeducation\n(Ravindran et al., 2021). Finally, one study found no group differ-\nence between participants with MDD receiving an 8-week yoga or\npsychoeducation intervention in mental health-related quality of life\nat 1-year follow-up (Kinser et al, 2014). From these previous\nstudies, it remains rather unclear whether a yoga intervention can\nlead to an increase of various aspects of well-being or quality of life.\nOur study was therefore designed to also address these questions.\n\nThe Present Study\nStudy Aim and Hypotheses\n\nThe overall objective of this study was to examine the potential\nbenefits of adding a MYT to TAU for young women with MDD. Our\nhypotheses were that compared to TAU-only, MYI + TAU would\nlead to: (H1) greater reductions in depression symptoms, assessed\nwith clinician-administered and self-report measures, and (H2)\ngreater increases in quality of life within various domains of\nfunctioning, defined as (H2.1) daily functioning, (H2.2a) quality\nof life, (H2.2b) quality of general health, and (H2.3) well-being. In\naddition, we tested if the anticipated beneficial effects of MYT on\nsymptoms of depression are partially mediated by (H3.1) reduced\nnegative perseverative cognition, (H3.2) reduced negative self-\nevaluation, (H3.3) decreased intolerance of uncertainty, (H3.4)\nincreases in perceived body awareness/interoceptive awareness,\nand (H3.5) increased mindfulness. We also assessed the cost-\neffectiveness of adding MY1 to TAU; these results will be published\nelsewhere.\n\n\nhrough the Americ\n\nent may be\n\n928 VOLLBEHR ET AL.\n\nExploratory analyses were conducted to examine whether the\neffects of MYT are moderated by demographic variables (e.g., socio-\neconomic status), clinical factors (e.g., comorbidity), and variables\nfrom the process evaluation (e.g., treatment adherence).\n\nMethod\nStudy Design and Participants\n\n‘We conducted a RCT with two conditions (TAU-only and MYT +\nTAU). This study protocol received ethical approval from the Medical\nEthical Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen\n(Registration Number NL.59324.042.16/2016/533) and was con-\nducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of\nHelsinki (Version 2013) and the Medical Research involving Human\nSubjects Act (in Dutch: Wet medisch-wetenschappelijk onderzoek\n‘met mensen). A more detailed description of the design, procedure\nand assessments is published elsewhere (Vollbehr et al, 2020).\nThis article has been prepared using the journal article reporting\nstandards-guidelines (Appelbaum et al., 2018) and the Consolidated\nStandards of Reporting Trials guidelines (Schulz et al, 2010) for\nreporting a RCT. The study was preregistered at Clinical Trials\n(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) with number NCT03388177.\n\nWe recruited 171 young women in ongoing treatment at several\npsychiatry outpatient clinics in the northern Netherlands. Inclusion\ncriteria were a primary diagnosis of MDD, age >18 and <34 years,\nand the ability to fluently read, write, and speak the Dutch language.\nExclusion criteria were a current diagnosis of bipolar disorder or\nsubstance dependance, current psychotic symptoms, active suicid-\nality, the unwillingness or inability to attend nine weekly sessions of\nyoga, and a current regular yoga practice (average of >30 min per\nweek over the past 6 months).\n\nProcedure\n\nRecruitment was from January 2017 to October 2018. Patients’\ntherapists prescreened potential participants on the inclusion and\nexclusion criteria and handed out an information package when a\npotential participant fit the study profile. After informed consent, the\nresearch assistant administered the structured interview for Diag-\nnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition\n(SCID-L; First et al., 2002) to verify the MDD diagnosis, and the\ninclusion and exclusion criteria, before inviting her to participate in\nthe trial. Serious adverse events were monitored by the yoga trainer\nduring the training (i.e., assessing whether participants experienced\ninjuries or illness after or between sessions) and by the research\nassistant during the study assessments (i.c., assessing whether any\nimportant life events had happened during the study period).\nFurther, at all assessment points participants completed question-\nnaires that assessed whether they had experienced hospital admis-\nsions and, if so, for which conditions.\n\nRandomization and Masking\n\nA methodologist from the Psychology Department of the Uni-\nversity of Groningen (CJA) was responsible for the randomization\nof the participants, using a computerized random number generation\nprocess. The methodologist informed the contact person (i.e., a\nclinical psychology graduate student) of the assignment for each\n\npatient. The contact person then informed the participant regarding\ntreatment allocation.\n\nThe research assistant assessed symptoms of depression at all\nassessments and was blinded to treatment allocation. For 11 parti-\ncipants, the blinding was broken (most common reasons were that\nparticipants emailed about yoga training [7 = 4], ran into the\nresearch assistant when doing the yoga training [n = 2], or spoke\nabout yoga during an interview [n = 2]). In these cases, the\nremaining assessments were done by another rater who was not\notherwise involved in the study. We assessed the fidelity of the\nblinding procedure and found that the research assistant guessed\ntreatment allocation correctly in less than 50% of cases at all\nassessments (T1: 45.9%, T2: 49.4%, T3: 40.0%), providing evi-\ndence for the adequacy of the rater blinding.\n\nMindful Yoga Intervention\n\nMYT was delivered as a manualized 9-week group training with\n1.5-hr weekly sessions, designed to enhance awareness of bodily\nsensations, emotions and thoughts, and to change processes that\ncontribute to depression. The intervention consisted of yoga\npostures, breathing practices, and meditation practices of tradi-\ntional hatha yoga (Anderson & Sovik, 2000), combined with\ninstructions designed to increase mindful awareness. As no infor-\n‘mation about the best length of a yoga intervention is yet available\n(Sherman, 2012), we based the length and frequency of the\nintervention on similar mindfulness-based stress reduction and\nmindfulness-based cognitive therapy training protocols, which\nare comparable interventions that have been found effective in\nreducing depression in adults (Chiesa & Serretti, 2010) and\nsymptoms of depression in young people, especially when the\nlength of the intervention is at least 8 weeks (Chi et al., 2018). Our\nintervention also matched the length and frequency of yoga inter-\nventions for (mental) health conditions used in previous studies\n(Sherman, 2012). In addition, a pilot study with the current\nintervention showed its feasibility for a patient population, as\nmost participants practiced daily (six out of eight participants\npracticed daily for 15-45 min; Vollbehr et al., 2021). The feasi-\nbility study findings also indicated that the intervention may be\nrelated to the potential mediating mechanisms of repetitive nega-\ntive thinking, perceived body awareness, fear of emotion, and\nacting with awareness (Vollbehr et al., 2021, 2022).\n\nBetween sessions, participants completed an online module that\nincluded psychoeducation about depression, self-monitoring assign-\nments, and videos for home practice (recommended time: 30-45\nmin a day). We encouraged participants to do home practice, as a\n‘meta-analysis of mindfulness intervention studies indicated that the\namount of home practice showed a small but significant association\nwith intervention outcomes (Parsons et al., 2017). Parsons et al.\n(2017) found that most participants practiced 30 min per day for\n6 days a week, which is in line with the findings from our feasibility\nstudy. We therefore created home practice exercises of 30-45 min.\nMYT was delivered by a psychologist (NKV) who is also a trained\nyoga teacher (a Yoga Alliance Registered Yoga Teacher 500 with\nover 15 years of yoga experience and over 4 years of teaching\nexperience). More detailed information about the intervention has\nbeen published elsewhere (Vollbehr et al., 2020, 2021). As the yoga\nteacher was also involved as a researcher, she was not involved in\nrecruitment, screening, treatment allocation, or assessments.\n\n\ncopyrighted by the Americ\n\nhrough the Americ\n\n2\ng\ng\n\nYOGA FOR YOUNG WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION\n\nTreatment as Usual\n\nTAU was delivered as individualized standard of care (Freedland\netal, 2011) and was administered according to the Dutch Treatment\nGuideline (Spijker et al., 2012). A more detailed description of this\nguideline and the treatment involved in the study can be found in\nSupplemental Materials. At the end of the study, the treatments\nreceived by participants were assessed from their medical files,\nincluding additional diagnoses, interventions, medication, and num-\nber of sessions. Information about additional diagnoses and TAU\ncan be found in Supplemental Materials. Briefly, about half (54.1%)\nof the participants had another diagnosis in addition to MDD. The\nother diagnosis was most often an anxiety disorder (n = 34) or a\npersonality disorder (n = 31). Mean treatment duration was 1 year\n(SD = 1.17, range 0-10). The majority of participants (51.8%)\nreceived more than one form of TAU, most often cognitive behav-\nioral therapy (n = 114), other psychological treatments (n = 53),\n‘medication consultation (n = 46), or psychiatric nursing treatment\n(n= 36). We did not restrict therapists from making changes during\nthe study regarding (a) diagnosis, (b) medication, (c) interventions,\nor (d) finishing the treatment. However, we did ask therapists to not\nadd an extra intervention to participants who were randomized in\nTAU-only to compensate for not receiving the yoga training.\n\nOutcomes\n\nAssessments took place (a) after informed consent and before\nrandomization (TO), (b) after the last MYI session or the same\nnumber of weeks for the TAU condition (T1, about 10-15 weeks\nafter TO), (c) 6 months after T1 (T2) and (d) 12 months after\nT1 (T3). All questionnaires were in Dutch and were validated in\nthe Dutch language, except for the three items from the Multidi-\nmensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, for which\nwe used our own translation, as no Dutch translation of this scale\nwas yet available. To assess interrater reliability of the clinician-\nadministered interviews, we had an independent rater (not otherwise\ninvolved in the study) assess 10% of these interviews at all assess-\n‘ment points.\n\nDescriptive Measures\n\nThe following demographic factors were assessed: age, level of\neducation (12 categories according to the Dutch educational sys-\ntem), relationship status (yes/no), employment status (yes/no),\nchildren (yes/no), and living situation (eight categories). Additional\nfactors that could influence outcomes were also assessed, including\n‘motivation to participate in the study (scale range 1-9, not motivated\nto very motivated), rating of current TAU (scale range 1-10, very\nlow quality to very high quality), expectation of success of the MYT\nin reducing depression symptoms (scale range 1-9, not successful to\nvery successful), and current yoga, meditation, and exercise practice\n(scale range 0-5, not to every day). Demographics were only\nassessed at baseline, whereas the other variables were assessed at\nall four assessment points.\n\nMDD History\n\nInformation regarding previous episodes, start of current episode,\nand age at first episode were assessed using the SCID-I interview\n(First et al. 2002).\n\n929\n\nOutcome Measures\n\nSeverity of depression was assessed with a clinician-administered\nscale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; Hamilton,\n1960). The internal consistency was low at baseline and acceptable\nto good at the subsequent three assessment points (x = .63 [T0]; .78\n[T1];.84 [T2]; .85 [T3]). The interrater reliability was excellent at all\nassessment points (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.94 [TO];\n0.95 [T1]; 0.94 [T2]; 0.97 [T3]). We also used a self-report ques-\ntionnaire, the Depression scale of the Depression Anxiety Stress\nScales-short form (DASS-sf; Henry & Crawford, 2005; Lovibond &\nLovibond, 1995). The internal consistency was good at all four\ntime points (« = .88 [TO]; .93 [TL]; .94 [T2]; .93 [T3]). Before\nrandomization and at the last assessments point the presence/absence\nof a diagnosis of MDD was assessed, using the SCID-T interview\n(First et al., 2002). The interrater reliability was good and excellent\n(Fleiss x = 0.64 [before randomization]; 1.00 [T3]).\n\nImpairment across several situations was assessed with the Work\nand Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; Mundt et al., 2002). The\ninternal consistency was low at baseline and good at the subsequent\nthree assessment points (c = .62 [TO]; .85 [T1]; .89 [T2]; .91 [T3]).\nPsychological well-being was assessed with the Purpose and Per-\nsonal Growth scales of the Ryff Scales of Psychological Well-\nBeing-short form (Ryff & Keyes, 1995). The internal consistency\nfor both scales was acceptable to good at all four assessments\n(Purpose: @ = .78 [TO]; .81 [T1]; .83 [T2]; .85 [T3]; Personal\ngrowth: @ = 73 [TO]; .81 [T1]; .80 [T2]; .82 [T3]). Quality of life\nwas assessed with two items from the World Health Organization\nQualitiy of Life Questionnaire — BREF (Harper & Power, 1998):\n(a) overall quality of life and (b) satisfaction with general health.\n\nMediators\n\n‘We used self-report questionnaires for five potential mediators;\nrumination was assessed with the Perseverative Thinking Question-\nnaire (Ehring et al., 2011), which showed good internal consistency\n(a = .92 [TO]; .95 [T1]; .96 [T2]; .97 [T3]). Self-criticism and\nself-compassion were assessed with the Self-Compassion Scale\n(SCS; Neff, 2003), which showed good internal consistency (a =\n88 [TO]; .93 [T1]; .94 [T2]; .94 [T3]). Recent evidence has shown\nthat the SCS can best be used to measure two separate factors of\nself-criticism and self-compassion instead of one bipolar construct\n(Lépez et al, 2015). We therefore analyzed these data using\nthese two factors. Intolerance of uncertainty was assessed with\nthe Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-short form (Carleton et al.,\n2007), which showed good internal consistency (a = .84 [TO]; .89\n[T1]; .89 [T2]; .91 [T3]). Perceived body awareness was assessed\nwith the Awareness scale of the Scale of Body Connection (Price &\nThompson, 2007), which showed good internal consistency (a = .82\n[TO]; .86 [T1]; .87 [T2]; .87 [T3]). To assess the trust-aspect of\nbody awareness, we used three additional items of the Multidimen-\nsional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Scale (Mehling et al.,\n2012), which demonstrated good internal consistency («= .86 [TO];\n85 [T1]; .89 [T2]; .85 [T3]). Mindfulness was measured by the\nFive Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer et al., 2006; Bohlmeijer\netal,, 2011), which showed acceptable to good internal consistency\n(a = .76 [TO]; .85 [T1]; .98 [T2]; .88 [T3]).\n\nTwo additional mediators consisted of reaction time tasks. The\nexogenous cueing task (ECT), based on Koster et al. (2005) was used\n\n\n\nhrough the Americ\n\nent may be\n\n930 VOLLBEHR ET AL.\n\nto assess attentional bias (AB) toward depression-related words. The\nECT was programed with the E-prime 2.0 software package. We\nused a Dutch version of the ECT that has been used in depression\nresearch (Elgersma et al., 2018, 2019), with words that score high on\nsubjective familiarity in the Dutch language (Hermans & Dehouwer,\n1994). Cues consisted of 10 depression-related, 10 positive, and 10\nneutral words that were selected based on representing depression-\nrelated, positive, and neutral categories (see Supplemental Materials,\nfor a complete description of the procedure of the ECT). We\ncalculated the internal consistency of the ECT by calculating the\nsplit half reliability for the first and second half of the ECT for each\ntype of trial as well as for the AB scores (calculation of the AB scores\ncan be found in “Data preparation, ECT analyses”), as recommended\nby Elgersma et al. (2019). The Spearman-Brown correlations were\nhigh for all types of trials, ranging from 0.75 (neutral valid) to 0.80\n(positive invalid) at TO, and from .74 (depressive valid/invalid and\npositive valid) to 0.82 (neutral valid) at T1, indicating a good internal\nconsistency. The Spearman-Brown correlations were low for the\nAB scores, ranging from 0.004 to 0.067 at TO (n = 167), and from\n0.053 to 0.089 at T1 (n = 155).\n\nDepressive self-identity was assessed with the Implicit Associa-\ntion Test (IAT; Greenwald et al., 1998). A self-depressed IAT was\nused to assess the strength of implicit self-depressed associations,\nbased on Glashouwer et al. (2012). Target categories consisted of\nwords indicating self or other and attribute categories consisted of\ndepression- or elated-related words. Each category consisted of five\nstimuli (see Supplemental Materials, for a complete description of\nthe IAT procedure). The IAT score was calculated using the D1\nalgorithm from Greenwald et al. (2003). Larger IAT scores indicated\na relatively stronger self-depression (vs. self-elation) association.\nTnternal consistency was assessed by creating two IAT scores (blocks\ncand f and blocks d and g). Split-half reliabilities of the IATs were\ngood, with Spearman-Brown corrected correlations between test\nhalves of 0.77 at TO (n = 169) and 0.77 at T1 (n = 155), which\nis comparable to previous research (Glashouwer & de Jong, 2010).\n\nEvaluation of the Yoga Intervention and\nTreatment Adherence/Fidelity\n\nAfter the intervention, participants were asked to rate (a) to what\nextent the MYT was successful in reducing their depression (range\n1-9, not successful to very successful), (b) the overall quality of the\ntraining, (d) the online module, and (¢) the instructor (for these four\nitems: range 1-10, very low quality to very high quality). Partici-\npants also rated the extent to which MYT had positive effects for\nthem with a 4-point scale of not, a little, somewhat, and a lot.\n\nTreatment accuracy, consistency of the intervention, and quality of\nthe teacher were assessed by having two independent raters observe a\nrandom 10% of the group sessions. Raters were senior yoga teachers\nwith at least 5 years of yoga practice and 2 years of teaching\nexperience. They rated whether (a) the practices and postures were\ntaught as described in the manual and (b) a mindful cue was given at\neach posture (e.g., a moment of silence, “notice,” “observe”. The\nrates also assessed the therapist's intervention skills (e.g., ability to\n‘model and embody the spirit of mindful yoga; being focused on the\npresent moment, showing a nonjudgmental/accepting attitude toward\nparticipants), and use of mindful cues (e.g., extent to which the\ntherapist used mindful cues to elicit awareness of the present moment,\nacceptance of current experience and self-compassion) on a 5-point\n\nscale ranging from 1 (low) to 5 (high). The teacher’s competence (e.g.,\noverall quality of the intervention in this session delivered by the\nteacher), and quality of the yoga exercises during the session were\nrated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (nof) to 5 (excellent). These\nquestions were adapted from a questionnaire designed to rate mind-\nfulness interventions (Chawla et al., 2010).\n\nThe mean of the two raters for treatment adherence was 97.7% for\npostures and 95.6% for mindful cues given with the postures. Mean\nteacher's attitude was 4.50 and mean quality of the mindful cues was\n4.14. Competence of the teacher was rated with a mean of 4.04\nindicating good overall quality and the yoga exercises were rated\nwith a mean of 3.84, also indicating good overall quality.\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nWe aimed for a sample of n = 64 per condition to provide power of\n80% (oe = .05) to detect medium effect size differences for the primary\noutcome measures of symptoms of depression (Cohen’s d = 0.5;\nCohen, 1988). We therefore recruited 171 participants (MYI + TAU:\nn = 88, TAU: n = 83), using a conservative attrition rate of 25%\n(comparable studies show rates of 15%-20%; Butler et al., 2008;\nSarubin et al., 2014). At 12-month follow-up, we had n =77 (MYI +\nTAU) and n = 70 (TAU) per group for our primary outcome\n‘measures. Power analysis using G * Power (Version 3.1.9.4; Faul\net al, 2007) indicated that the current sample size provided a\nstatistical power of 33% to detect small effect size differences,\n97% to detect medium effect size differences, and 100% to detect\nlarge effect size differences between conditions.\n\nAll analyses were performed based on intention-to-treat. Missing\ndata on the outcome measures were handled using Multiple Impu-\ntation through Chained Equations (MICE; van Buuren, 2018a).\nMICE uses linear regression to estimate missing values on variables,\nusing the other variables as predictors, and logistic regression to\nestimate missing values on these variables. We had a maximum of\n11% (MYI + TAU) and 17% (TAU) missing for our primary\noutcome measures. The missing completely at random test was\nnot significant, indicating that our data were missing completely at\nrandom. We therefore decided to generate m = 5 imputed data sets\nusing the Multiple Imputation Macro in SPSS 26.0 (Van Buuren,\n2018b). In order to reduce the number of variables in the data set, we\ncreated different data sets for the analyses of the primary outcome\n‘measures (12 variables), secondary outcome measures (23 vari-\nables), mediators (34 variables), and moderators (111 variables).\nDue to missing data handling limitations in SPSS 26.0, the results of\nthe analyses on the imputed data sets were manually converted into\none set of results, using an Excel datasheet. To ensure the accuracy\nof this conversion and the subsequent calculations, these were\nchecked by our methodologist (CJA).\n\nWe also conducted per protocol analyses. For these analyses, we\nused three factors to determine which participants were selected for\nthe per protocol analyses. First, participants of both conditions were\nincluded if they were still receiving TAU at T1. Second, participants\nin the TAU-only condition were selected if they did not practice\nyoga at T1. Third, participants in the MYI + TAU condition were\nselected if they attended >5 of 9 MYT sessions (Kuyken et al., 2010;\nTeasdale et al., 2000).\n\n‘We used IBM SPSS Statistics 26 for all analyses. Repeated\nmeasures ANOVAs were used for the primary and secondary\nhypotheses, with the values of the primary and secondary outcome\n\n\nhrough the Americ\n\nent may be\n\nYOGA FOR YOUNG WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION 931\n\n‘measures as dependent variables, condition as the between-subjects\nfactor, and time (all four assessment points) as the within-subjects\nfactor. Between-group effect sizes were calculated using n>\n(Kelley, 1935). For the HDRS, we also assessed the minimal\nclinically important difference (MCID). Based on previous research\n(Hengartner & Ploederl, 2022), we set the MCID as a difference\nof three points.\n\nNext, the mediation hypotheses were tested with 10,000 samples\nbootstrapping regression model using the PROCESS macro for\nSPSS (Hayes, 2012). We tested the indirect effects of condition\n(MYI + TAU vs. TAU) on all three primary outcome measures\n(baseline to follow-up) through the potential mediating variables\n(baseline to postintervention, nine variables in total) according to the\n‘methods suggested by Preacher and Hayes (2008). We conducted a\ntotal of 27 mediation analyses. Potential moderators were tested with\nregression analyses. We used regression analyses with a total of 132\nanalyses, with change in the primary outcome measures from baseline\nto 12-month follow-up as dependent variable (except for the SCID\noutcome measure where we used diagnostic status at 12-months),\nand the interaction term of condition and the (standardized) potential\n‘moderating variable as moderator. We tested all potential modera-\ntors, including baseline depression information from the SCID\n(three variables; e.g., number of previous episodes), demographic\nvariables (six variables; e.g., age), rating of treatment, motivation,\nand expectations (three variables), clinical variables (six variables;\ne.g, additional diagnosis), primary and secondary outcome mea-\nsures at baseline (six variables), potential mediators at baseline (nine\nvariables), and TAU variables at baseline (11 variables; e.g., type of\ntreatment). Mediation and moderation analyses were per protocol.\n\nData Preparation\n\n‘The data of one participant (in MYI + TAU) were excluded from\nall analyses because of having already completed treatment at the\nstart of the study (she had entered the study due to an error). For\nseveral outcome measures, the assumption of normality was vio-\nlated. Yet, since the variance was equally distributed in both groups,\nwe retained the planned analyses (Ernst & Albers, 2017). As the\nLevene's test of variance was significant for the SCID and DASS\ndepression outcomes at T3, we calculated the ratio of the variances.\nThese values were between one and two (1.34 and 1.42) and\ntherefore not problematic for the analyses. In several cases, the\nsphericity assumption was violated (main analyses: HDRS, WSAS,\nquality of life and health, purpose and growth; per protocol analyses:\nHDRS, DASS). In these cases, we reported the Huyn-Feldt cor-\nrected results (Howell, 2002).\n\nAnalyses of the Exogenous Cueing Task (ECT)\n\nFor MYI + TAU, there were n = 84 remaining at TO and n = 82 at\nT1. For TAU, there were n = 82 at TO and n = 72 at T1. Incorrect\nresponses were removed. After visual inspection of the data, as\nrecommended by Koster et al. (2005) and in line with previous\nstudies (Elgersma et al., 2018, 2019), reaction times (RTs) < 200 ms\n\nand RTs > 1,000 ms were excluded as outliers, indicating anticipa-\ntory responding and distractions. A total of 97.68% (T0) and\n97.44% (T1) of data were used in the analyses. Median RTs\nwere generated per individual, per type of trial (positive invalid,\npositive valid, depression invalid, depression valid, neutral invalid,\nneutral valid). We followed previous studies in using the median RT\n(rather than the mean) as itis a simple and robust way of dealing with\npotential outliers (e.g., Elgersma et al., 2018, 2019).\n\nWe calculated a general AB score for depression, as recommended\nby Mogg et al. (2008) and used in previous studies (Elgersma et al.,\n2019), using the following formula:\n\n(See below)\n\nThe general AB was scored such that larger values indicate\nrelatively greater AB for the depression stimuli.\n\nAs recommended in similar studies (Elgersma et al., 2019), scores\ndeviating more than 3 SDs from the group mean were considered\noutliers. At TO, we found two outliers (one in each condition). At\nT1 there were no outliers. We conducted analyses with and without\nthese outliers.\n\nAnalyses of the Implicit Association Task\n\nMean error rate was 6.10% for TO (SD = 4.39 range 0%-33.8%),\nand 6.43 for T1 (SD = 4.70, range 0%-32.5%). There were no\nparticipants with more than 10% of trials below 300 ms, and no\nparticipants were found to have an unusual D-score (>5 SD from\nmean), therefore no additional participants were excluded from the\nanalyses (c.g., Glashouwer & de Jong, 2010). At TO, there were n=\n86 remaining in MYI + TAU, and n = 82 at T1. For TAU, these\nwere n =82 at TOand n=72 at T1.\n\nResults\nRecruitment, Attrition and Baseline Characteristics\n\nFigure 1 shows the participant flow. A total of 171 participants\nwere randomized, of whom 88 received the MYI + TAU. All\nparticipants completed baseline assessments of symptoms of depres-\nsion and 169 completed the demographic characteristics question-\nnaires. At 12-month follow-up, in MYI + TAU n = 77 (89%)\ncompleted the assessments and in TAU n = 70 (84%). Table 1 shows\nan overview of the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics\nof the participants for each condition (see Supplemental Materials,\nfor additional baseline characteristics). Mean level of clinician-rated\ndepression using the HDRS was 18.57 (SD = 5.94, range 7-33),\nindicating moderate depression (Zimmerman et al., 2013). Mean\nlevel of self-reported depression using the DASS was 21.11 (SD =\n9.29, range 2-42), indicating severe depression (Lovibond &\nLovibond, 1995). No serious adverse events related to the yoga\ntraining were reported during the course of the study.

A minority reported three or more\nprevious episodes (n = 33). For the majority of participants, the\ncurrent episode started more than 2 years ago (n = 55), or between\none and 2 years ago (n = 54). The mean age at the start of the first\nepisode was 18 years (SD = 5.24, range 6-33).\n\nAt T1, five participants (3%) had completed treatment. Mean\nnumber of received sessions of the participants still in treatment\nwas 9.67 (SD = 6.15, range 0-38). Sixty-one additional participants\n(37%) had completed treatment at T2. Of the participants still in\ntreatment, the mean number of sessions was 17.97 (SD = 12.69, range\n0-74). At T3, another 23 participants (22.3%) had completed their\ntreatment. Of the participants still in treatment, mean number of\ncontacts was 16.10 (SD = 9.85, range 0-48). There were no group\ndifferences on any of these variables (ps > 315), except for the rating\nof the current treatment, with participants in MYI + TAU being more\nsatisfied about their treatment (M = 7.69, SD = 0.86, range 6-9)\ncompared to participants in TAU (M = 7.09, SD = 1.21, range 4-9),\nF(1, 68) = 5.81, p = 0.019, with an effect size of Cohen's d = 0.32.\n\nIntervention and Yoga Practice\n\nOf the 88 participants who were randomized into MYI + TAU, 86\nstarted the intervention and 69 (79%) completed at least five sessions.\nMost common reasons for noncompletion were scheduling issues\n(n= 28) and insufficient motivation (n = 6). Mean number of attended\nsessions was six (SD = 2.38, range 0-9). After the intervention, the\nquality of the MYT was rated with a mean score of 7.7 (SD = 1.42,\nrange 4-10), the online module with 6.5 (SD = 1.98, range 1-10),\nand the teacher with 8.8 (SD = 1.17, range 5-10). Most participants\nindicated that they experienced some (n = 27, 34%), followed by\nquite some (n = 25, 31%) and a lot (n = 15, 19%) of positive effects\nof the training. Thirteen participants (16%) indicated they did not\nexperience positive effects.\n\nPostintervention, MYT participants indicated that they practiced\nyoga once a week (n = 28), 2-3 times a week (n = 19), 1-2 times a\nmonth (n = 15), and less than once a month (n = 8). Fifteen\nparticipants (17%) did not practice at all. Data regarding the use of\nthe online module during the MY1 were taken from track records of\nthe online system. Mean number of completed online sessions was\n3.6 (SD = 3.1, range 0-9). Eighteen participants did not complete\nany session. Four completed all nine sessions.\n\nSix months after the intervention, 58% of the MYI participants\nreported that they continued to practice yoga, at the frequency of less\nthan once a month (n = 22), once a week (n = 12), once or twice a\nmonth (n = 10), or 2-3 times per week (1 = 5). At the 12-month\nassessment, 56% of participants reported they were still practicing\nyoga, at the frequency of less than once a month (n = 18), once or twice\namonth (n= 13), once a week (n = 13) or 2-3 times per week (n= 3).\nIn the control group, several participants started to practice yoga over\nthe course of the study (7 =9 at TI; n= 7 at T2; n = 9 at T3).\n\nCorrelations\n\nWe correlated all variables assessing yoga practice, completed\nnumber of sessions of the MYI and online module, expectations,\n\nVOLLBEHR ET AL.\n\npositive effects, evaluation of the training, online module and\nthe teacher with change on the primary outcome measures from\nTO to T3.

We did not\nfind substantial evidence for any of the potential moderators (i.e.,\nshowing a significant interaction effect on at least two out of three\nprimary outcome measures).\n\nDiscussion\nSummary of the Main Findings\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first RCT to investigate the efficacy\nof adding a MYT to TAU in young women with depression and to\nstudy potential mediators and moderators of the MYI effects.\nRegarding our primary hypothesis, compared to TAU-only, adding\nMYI to TAU did not result in a larger decrease of symptoms of\ndepression at postintervention or follow-up or in fewer MDD\ndiagnosis at 12-month follow-up. The findings showed that there\nwas a 1.25-point difference between the conditions in decline on the\nHamilton depression measure at 12-months follow-up, which is\nroughly half the 3-point criterion for a minimal clinically relevant\ndifference (Hengartner & Ploederl, 2022).\n\nThe results also did not support our secondary hypothesis, as we\ndid not find that adding MYT to TAU led to larger increases of well-\nbeing and general functioning. The third hypothesis was mostly\nunsupported as we did not find any of the candidate mediating\nvariables to mediate the relation between condition and outcomes,\nexcept for self-compassion on self-reported symptoms of depres-\nsion. Further, the moderation analyses did not support a role for any\nof the potential moderators.\n\nComparing the Current Findings With\nPrevious Research\n\nOur findings are in line with previous studies that have compared\nyoga with TAU on depression outcomes in clinical samples. Con-\nsistent with the majority of these studies (Vollbehr et al., 2018),\nwe did not find a significant difference between MYI + TAU and\nTAU-only in reducing depression. As most of the previous research\nhad methodological shortcomings such as small sample sizes, short\nfollow-up periods, and the absence of a manualized intervention, the\nvalidity of the previous results may have been suboptimal. One way\nthat the present study contributes to the literature is by addressing\nthese methodological issues with design elements such as using a\nclinical sample, a large sample size, having a blinded rater, admin-\nistering the intervention with a manual, and using a control condi-\ntion of evidence-based interventions. The improved design elements\nmake the current results more reliable and increase confidence in\ntheir interpretation with regard to the clinical value of adding MYI to\nTAU. Further, our study is one of the few trials that has examined\nthe effectiveness of a yoga intervention for MDD in a clinical\nsetting, as most studies have used community samples (Vollbehr\netal, 2018).\n\n‘This study examined the efficacy of MY1 by adding it to TAU for\nyoung women with MDD. Regarding the addition of a yoga\nintervention to TAU, we found six other studies that compared\n\n\nent may be shared at no\n\n936\n\nFigure 4\nBar Graphs of the Difference Scores on the General Functioning\n(Top), Quality of Life and Health (Middle) and Purpose and\nGrowth (Bottom) Secondary Outcome Measures From Baseline\nto Postintervention, 6-Month, and 12-Month Follow-Up\n\n2 120\n\nF\n|:\n\nvention Baseline-G-month FU Baseline-12-month FU\n\nBaseline post intervention Boseline-6-month FU Basclne-12-month FU\n\nBaseline-postintervention  Baseline--month FU Baselines 2-month FU\n\nm0\n\nBaseline-12-month FU\n\n50\n3 so\n3 40\nH\n2 0\nFIED ;\ngw E | I\nEe = | i\nBosclue-postintervetion Baselne-G-month FU Baslie-12-month FU\nSTAU + MYT aTAU\nNote.

Two of these studies had similar findings to\nours with no group differences between the yoga group and the\ncontrol group (Ravindran et al., 2021; Sarubin et al., 2014). The\nother four studies found a significant difference in decrease of\nsymptoms of depression in favor of the yoga group (Broota &\nDhir, 1990; Falsafi, 2016; Subbanna et al., 2021; Tolahunase et al.,\n2018). A potential explanation for the discrepancy with our findings\nmight relate to differences in the TAU that was offered to the\nparticipants. In our study, all participants received an individualized\nstandard form of TAU that could include medication as well as other\nforms of treatment, while in three out of four of the other studies the\nonly treatment allowed was psychiatric medication (Broota & Dhir,\n1990; Subbanna et al., 2021; Tolahunase et al., 2018), and in one\nstudy, only part of the participants received actual treatment (56.6%\n‘medication and 22.4% psychotherapy; Falsafi, 2016). Intensity of\nintervention is another potential reason for the positive findings in\nthe other studies. Compared to the 1.5 hr/session a week for 9 weeks\nin the present study, the studies with positive findings all had more\nintensive interventions—three 20-30-min sessions in 3 days in\nBroota and Dhir (1990), 2 hr/session, five sessions per week for\n12 weeks in Tolahunase et al. (2018), or four-to-six 1-hr sessions per\nweek for 3 months in Subbanna et al. (2021). Another indication of\nthe less intensive nature of our intervention is that the participants\nshowed relatively low amounts of home practice.\n\nSeveral other studies that compared a yoga intervention to various\ncontrol conditions have found positive results as well (Butler et al.,\n2008; Field etal., 2012, 2013; Mitchell et al., 2012; Prathikanti et al.,\n2017; Schuver & Lewis, 2016; Uebelacker et al., 2015). However,\nmost of these studies used a psychoeducation control group (Butler\netal., 2008; Field et al., 2012, 2013; Mitchell et al., 2012; Prathikanti\net al., 2017; Uebelacker et al., 2015), controlling only for nonspe-\ncific factors. In contrast, yoga interventions have generally not been\nfound to be more effective in reducing depression when compared to\nactive control groups such as mindfulness training (Falsafi, 2016),\n‘massage therapy (Field et al., 2012), or walking (Schuver & Lewis,\n2016). To summarize, our nonsignificant findings are in line with\nmost other yoga intervention studies that used a strong (active)\ncomparison condition.\n\nIt may be informative to also compare our findings with studies\nthat investigated mindfulness-based interventions for patients with\nacute MDD using the addition of mindfulness interventions to TAU,\ncompared to TAU alone. These studies have generally found a\nsignificant decrease of symptoms of depression in the intervention\ngroup plus TAU compared to the TAU-only group (Barnhofer et al.,\n2009; Kingston et al., 2007; Omidi et al., 2013; van Aalderen et al.,\n2012). However, as in most yoga intervention studies, the exact\nnature of TAU was either unclear (Kingston et al., 2007; van\nAalderen et al., 2012) or was restricted to the use of antidepressant\nmedication without psychological treatments (Barnhofer et al.,\n2009; Omidi et al., 2013). Therefore, it is possible that in these\nmindfulness studies the TAU control was weaker than the TAU\nreceived by all participants in the present study, which consisted of a\nvariety of interventions recommended by the Dutch guidelines.\n\n\nhrough the Americ\n\nent may be\n\nYOGA FOR YOUNG WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION 937\n\nAs most participants in the present study received more than one\ntype of recommended intervention, including psychological treat-\nment such as cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 114) or other\npsychological interventions (n = 53), it might have been the case\nthat TAU in the present study was already rather complete and that\nthe MYT has not been able to add much—for example due to not\nhaving enough time or energy to dedicate to the MYI practices.\n\nConsidering our findings for the general functioning and quality\nof life outcomes, we found three studies investigating a yoga\nintervention that also assessed these positive outcomes in patients\nwith depression. None of these studies found differences between\nyoga and psychoeducation control on mental health quality of life\n(Kinser et al., 2014), social and role functioning, and general health\nperception (Uebelacker et al., 2017), or quality of life (Ravindran\netal., 2021). Our null-findings for the secondary outcome measures\nare thus in line with these previous findings.\n\nFinally, regarding potential mechanisms of the yoga intervention,\nthe results did not indicate mediating effects of any of the potential\nvariables, except for self-compassion on self-reported symptoms of\ndepression. Although we could not find any other yoga for depres-\nsion studies that assessed mediation, we did find three studies that\nassessed yoga effects on potential mediating mechanisms. First,\nFalsafi (2016) found that a yoga intervention led to more mindful-\nness compared to wait-list control, but not when compared to a\n‘mindfulness intervention. Also, the yoga intervention did not lead to\n‘more self-compassion, compared to wait-list or mindfulness control.\nSecond, Prathikanti et al. (2017) used self-efficacy and self-worth\nscales and found that there was no significant difference between the\nyoga and control group of psychoeducation on these scales. Last,\nSchuver and Lewis (2016) used a rumination scale and found a\nsignificant group difference in favor of the yoga group postinter-\nvention, compared to walking control, but not at the 1-month follow-\nup. A potential reason for the discrepancy between our null-findings\nfor rumination and the findings of Schuver and Lewis (2016) is that\nthey used a walking intervention control whereas our study used\nTAU, which likely contained elements that targeted rumination\n(such as cognitive behavioral therapy). The type of control group\n‘might also explain the difference between our study and the findings\nof Falsafi (2016) for a change in mindfulness—we used actual\nevidence-based interventions as control where in the Falsafi (2016)\nstudy a wait-list control was used and only part of the participants\nreceived evidence-based treatment.\n\nAlthough there was only one statistically significant mediation\neffect, the results did indicate main effects in favor of the MY1 leading\nto increased self-compassion and perceived body awareness. These\nresults may indicate evidence for MYI as an active intervention.\n‘These findings show that while it appears that there is some evidence\nthat the MYI did what it was intended to do (increase of self-\ncompassion and perceived body awareness), these effects did not\nact as mediators of MYI on depression, with the above noted\nexception of self-compassion on self-reported depression symptoms.\n\nStrengths and Limitations\n\nThe present study has a number of methodological elements that\nadd confidence to the results. First, we preregistered our study and\ndesigned a rigorous trial, adhering to the Consolidated Standards\nof Reporting Trials guidelines. Second, we were able to include a\nrelatively large sample within mental health institutions that showed\n\nlow attrition even at 12-month follow-up (15%, whereas comparable\nstudies showed 29% attrition at 6 months; Uebelacker et al., 2017\nor 67% at 1 year; Kinser et al., 2014). Our ability to include and\nretain this sample helped to provide adequate power for detecting\nmedium to large effect size differences. Third, we used clinician-\nadministered measures to assess symptoms of depression (which\nshowed excellent interrater reliability), thereby augmenting the self-\nreport measures. Fourth, our rater blinding was found to be valid,\nhelping to prevent rater bias and increase confidence in the validity\nof the clinician-administered measures of depression. This is notable\nas we found no other RCTs studying yoga interventions for depres-\nsion that adequately assessed rater blinding (Vollbehr et al, 2018).\nFifth, we used a relatively long follow-up period of 1 year, making it\npossible to also draw longer term conclusions, and not only con-\nclusions right after finishing treatment. Given that a critique of\nprevious research is that due to a lack of longer term follow-up\nassessments, even when benefits of a yoga intervention are found, it\nis unclear whether they are lasting (Vollbehr et al., 2018). With this\nlonger follow-up, we are able to give better information about\nwhether initial benefits are lasting. Sixth, we conducted a thorough\nassessment of TAU through review of participants’ medical files.\n‘This provided knowledge regarding what evidence-based interven-\ntions were used in TAU and helped to ensure that our control group\nwas a strong comparison. This point is important because a weak\nTAU may lead to overestimations of the added value of the target\ntreatment (Baskin et al., 2003). Seventh, we assessed treatment\nadherence of the yoga teacher, who was found to closely follow the\n‘manual by independent raters and received good ratings on quality\nand attitude by the participants. Finally, we assessed whether the\nyoga intervention was doing what it was designed to do by analyzing\ngroup differences on the potential mediators for the MYT completers\nand TAU group from baseline to postintervention. The results\nshowed that the MYI indeed led to more self-compassion and\nperceived body awareness. This is a strength of the study as\nmost other yoga intervention studies have not examined whether\nthe intervention is active in the sense of influencing targeted\n‘mechanisms.\n\nIn addition to the strengths listed above, several limitations are\nrelevant for interpreting the findings. First, participants in both\nconditions received evidence and guideline-based specialized\ncare, which might have hampered the additional effect of MYT\nfor reasons such as having less time and energy for devoting to the\nyoga home practices. Perhaps related, participants generally did\nnot complete the home practice. The MYT was designed to include\nan online module to facilitate the practice of exercises for at least\n30-45 min per day, but none of the participants practiced this often;\nthe majority practiced once a week or less. Although this suboptimal\ncompletion of the intervention might have prevented stronger\nbenefits, this interpretation may not be the best one as correlation\nbetween amount of practice and change in the primary outcomes\n‘measures was not significant. Finally, this study was designed to\nenhance MDD treatment for young women, as they are especially at\nrisk for developing MDD. However, the sample also means that the\ngeneralizability of our findings is limited to young women suffering\nfrom clinical depression, as we did not include men or older adults\nin the sample. This limitation may be important as research has\nshown that meditation interventions have different effects for men\nand women (Rojiani et al, 2017), and that psychotherapeutic\ninterventions have shown larger effects sizes in adults compared\n\n\n\ned publishers.\n\nThis document is\n\nZz\nE\n<\nE!\nEl\nEg\n4\n\nntent in part or wi\n\n938\n\nto adolescents (Cuijpers et al, 2020). Also, as the participants\nconsisted of young women in the northern part of the Netherlands,\nthe sample had relatively little ethnic diversity, which may limit the\ngeneralizability of the results.\n\nRecommendations for Clinical Practice and\nFuture Research\n\nFindings that yoga is a popular practice among young women\n(Cramer et al., 2016a; Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2020) were sup-\nported in our study, as participants positively evaluated MYI as a\nform of treatment. This suggests that MYI may be beneficial for\noptimizing the attractiveness of treatment. Additional research may\nprovide information regarding whether other groups such as the\nelderly or populations with chronic mood and anxiety disorders\nbenefit more strongly from MYL Further, given that the mean group\ndifference of 1.25 is nearly half of the MCID and in the expected\ndirection, there may be subgroups of young women with MDD that\nderive greater benefit from MYL Clinical practice would benefit\nfrom research that determines such subgroups. Finally, it is possible\nthat MY may be more helpful when patients are recovered and have\nthe energy and psychological resources that allow for more com-\n‘mitted practice. From this perspective, future research may benefit\nfrom examining the potential of MYT as a relapse prevention\ntreatment.\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson, S., & Sovik, R. (2000). Yoga.
