This holds particularly\ntrue for patients with major depressive disorders. The aim of the present study was to explore whether patients with major depressive\ndisorders (MDD) and a history of suicide attempts differed in their early maladaptive schemas from patients with MDD but without such a\nhistory or from healthy controls.\n\nMethod: Ninety participants took part in the study. Of these, 30 were patients with MDD who had made a recent suicide attempt; 30 were\npatients with MDD but no suicide attempts, and 30 were gender- and age-matched healthy controls. Participants completed questionnaires\ncovering socio-demographic characteristics and the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ- RE2R) to assess early maladaptive schemas.\nExperts rated patients\u2019 MDD with the Montgomery\u2014Asberg Depression Rating Scale.\n\nResults: Patients did not differ in experts\u201d ratings of symptoms of depression. Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD recorded\nhigher scores on maladaptive schemas such as recognition seeking, negativity/pessimism, and insufficient self-control. Compared to patients\nwithout suicide attempts and healthy controls, those who had made a suicide attempt had higher scores on dimensions such as failure,\n\u2018mistrust, emotional inhibition, social isolation, and abandonment/instability.\n\nConclusion: Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD had more pronounced maladaptive schemas, but this was more marked in\npatients with a history of suicide attempts. The results suggest that suicide attempts and poorer psychological functioning are related.\n\n\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n1.

Ahmadpanah et al. / Comprehensive Psychiatry 77 (2017) 71-79\n\nincrease during economic crises [7]. However, recent\nfindings from Greece [8] have not supported this notion\nwhen factors such as psychiatric disorders and the social\nenvironment are taken into at account. Nonetheless, on a\nmicro-level, economic hardship has been reported as one of\nseveral factors in attempted suicide in Iran [9].\n\nNext, evidence from psychiatry points to a close\nassociation of suicide and suicidal behavior with psychiatric\ndisorders [1,10], and specifically with major depressive\ndisorders [11,12]. Further, Ajdacic-Gross [13] reported the\nfollowing increases in suicide risk (compared to healthy\ncontrols): patients immediately following discharge,\n200-fold increase; patients during stay in psychiatric\nhospitals, 50-fold increase; more than one psychiatric\ndiagnose within the last 4 weeks, 90-fold increase; different\npsychiatric diagnoses, 10-25-fold increase. With respect to\ncompleted suicides, Arsenault-Lapierre et al. [10] reported in\ntheir meta-analysis the following: a) a mental disorder was\ndiagnosed in 87% of the 3275 cases included in the studies, b)\nwith respect to gender, diagnoses of substance-related\nproblems, personality disorders, and childhood disorders\nwere more common among male suicides, while affective\ndisorders, including depressive disorders, were more common\namong female suicides. More specifically, suicide and suicidal\nbehavior were associated with bipolar and unipolar mood\ndisorders [1,14]. In the present study, we focused on major\ndepressive disorders, as depression contributes most strongly to\nsuicide attempts (population attributable risk (PAR) of 26.6%;\n[12,15,16]). In this view and most importantly, Pompili ct al.\n[11] showed that, among patients with MDD, non-adherence\nwas a significant predictor of negative outcomes such as high\nrates of recurrence/relapse and active suicidal ideation and\nsuicidal behavior. A positive history of non-adherence has also\nbeen associated with both prior suicide attempts and active\nsuicidal ideation. Improving adherence generally may prevent\nsuicidal behaviors. We took this observation into account; in\nthe present study we investigated inpatients under stable and\nsupervised psychopharmacological treatment.\n\nResearch based on neurophysiological approaches to\nunderstanding suicidal behavior has not produced satisfac-\ntory prediction rates. Thus, while some researchers have\nclaimed that dramatically lower cholesterol levels predict\nsuicidal behavior, this has not been the case in other studies\n(see Shaker et al. [17] for more detail; they concluded that\nmost probably a broad variety of socio-demographic, social,\nphysiological and psychological factors impact concomi-\ntantly and independently on suicidal behavior).\n\nIn the present study we focused on psychological dimensions\nto gain more insight into the cognitive-\u2014emotional processes that\nmight underlie suicidal behavior. To this end, patients with\n\u2018major depressive disorders (MDD) and with or without a history\nof suicide attempts completed the Young Schema Questionnaire\nto assess carly maladaptive schemas. More specifically, we\nanticipated that patients with such a history would be more\nfocused on interpersonal relationship issues such as disconnec-\ntion, rejection, inhibition, and abandonment, when compared\n\ncither to patients without this history or to healthy controls. In\nthis respect, Joiner et al. [18] and Bryan et al. [19] argue that,\namong other factors, interpersonal-psychological dimensions\nsuch as perceived burdensomeness (that is, the belief to be\nliability to other people), and thwarted belongingness (i.c., the\nbelief that one does not belong to a social group, or to be\nunimportant and useless to other people) increase the risk of\ncommitting suicide. Likewise, O'Connor and Nock [12]\nconcluded in their review that feelings of defeat, social rejection,\nentrapment, and humiliation, along with subjectively perceived\nlow social support (all reflecting negative and stressful social\nrelation and interactions) were particular contributors to\nincreased risk of committing suicide. We took these observa-\ntions into account and asked to what extent inpatients with\nmajor depressive disorders and with a recent history of suicide\nattempts might differ in their carly maladaptive schemas,\ncompared to inpatients with major depressive disorders but\nwithout any suicide attempts.\n\nAccording to Becks cognitive view of the emergence and\nmaintenance of depression [20], mental concepts such as the\nassumptions, schemas, memories, beliefs, goals, expecta-\ntions, hopes, plans, assignments and cognitive biases of\npersons influence their behavioral and emotional responses\nto the social environment [20]. Such mental concepts might\nbe particularly biased in people with suicidal ideation and\nbehavior, and this reasoning also draws on the concept of\nevolutionary psychology. According to De Catanzaro [21]\nand Joiner [18] people are more prone to suicide the less\nattached they feel to a social group (family, relatives,\nreligious society, etc.), the more of a burden they feel to the\nsocial group, and the weaker they feel the prospects to be of\nbecoming integrated within a social community. Thus, we\nwould expect a higher salience of issues related to social\ninteraction among patients with suicide attempt history than\namong those without (see also [22-24]).\n\nAccording to Ball and Cecero [25], after becoming acute,\ncarly maladaptive schemas act as personality traits, and we\nexpected greater prevalence of early maladaptive schemas in\npeople suffering from MDD, and more so among those with\na history of suicide attempts [25]. According to Young ct al.\n[26], schemas that are foundations for later psychological\ndisorders can be described as maladaptive. Early maladap-\ntive schemas are self-defeating emotional and cognitive\npatterns established in childhood and repeated throughout\nlife. Following Young et al. [26] and Amtz and Gitta [27], 18\nmaladaptive schemas are identified, and grouped into five\nschema domains as follows:\n\nA: The first domain concerns disconnection/rejection\nand includes five schemas formed as a consequence\nof unmet needs such as security and empathy. These\nare abandonment/instability, mistrust/abuse, emo-\ntional deprivation, defectiveness/shame, and social\nisolation/alienation.\n\nB: The second domain includes schemas centered on\nimpaired autonomy/performance, schemas formed\n\n\nM. Ahmadpanah et al. / Comprehensive Psychiatry 77 (2017) 71-79 7\n\nin the context of families in which children\u2019s\nself-esteem is belittled and their autonomy under-\nmined. These are: dependence/incompetence, vul-\nnerability to harm or illness, enmeshment/\nundeveloped self, failure.\n\nC: The third domain includes the schemas of entitlement/\ngrandiosity, and insufficient self-control/self-\ndiscipline, which focus on lack of commitment,\nirresponsibility and lack of respects for others\u201d rights\nor appreciation of limits.\n\nD: With an emphasis on extreme attention to others\u2019\nneeds and emotions, the fourth domain is named\nother-directedness and includes three schemas: sub-\njugation, self-sacrifice, and approval-seeking/\nrecognition-secking.\n\nE: The fifth domain is hyper vigilance/inhibition. It\nincludes four schemas: negativity/pessimism, cmo-\ntional inhibition, unrelenting standards/hypercritical-\nness, and punitiveness.\n\nStudies have shown that carly maladaptive schemas play\npivotal roles in addiction [28-30], obsessive/compulsive\ndisorder [31,32], PTSD [33-36], and depression and anxiety\n[37]. However, while there are at least three different studies\nexamining carly maladaptive schemas and suicidal behavior\namong patients with BPD [38,39] and borderline personality\ndisorders [40], to the best of our knowledge no research has yet\nlooked at patients with MDD and suicidal behavior. We believe\nsuch research could contribute to improvements in counseling\nand prevention and could decrease the risk of suicidal behavior.\nSpecifically, counseling might focus on strengthening patients\u2019\nsocial skills and interactional behavior; Brand et al. [41]\nshowed that, among patients with environment-related com-\nplaints, poor interaction was related to psychiatric complaints.\nFurthermore, Jahangard et al. [42] showed that training\nemotional intelligence was feasible and had the effect of\nreducing symptoms of depression and raising social skills\namong patients with borderline personality disorders.\n\nThe following hypotheses were formulated. First, fol-\nlowing Akbarian ct al. [33], Ahmadian et al. [43], Beck [20],\nand others, we expected that, compared to healthy controls,\npatients with major depressive disorders would have higher\nscores for carly maladaptive schemas. Second, following De\nCatanzaro [21], Joiner et al. [18], and Arsenault-Lepierre ct\nal. [10], O'Connor and Nock [12], and Bryan ct al. [16] we\nanticipated that, compared to healthy controls and to patients\nwith MDD but with no history of suicide attempts, patients\nwith MDD and a history of suicide attempts would have\nhigher scores for carly maladaptive schemas.\n\n2. Method\n2.1. Procedure\n\nInpatients of the Sina and Farshchian Hospitals (Hamadan,\nIran) with major depressive disorders were approached to\n\nparticipate in the present cross-sectional study. Healthy age-\nand gender-matched controls were also recruited. All\neligible participants were informed about the aims of the\nstudy, and the voluntary basis of participation. Once written\ninformed consent was signed, participants completed\nquestionnaires covering socio-demographic variables, the\nBeck Depression Inventory (see below) and the Young\nSchema Questionnaire (YSQ- RE2R; sce below) to assess\ncarly maladaptive schemas. Experts conducted a psychiatric\ninterview to diagnose major depressive disorders according\nto the DSM 5, and rated patients\u2019 major depressive disorders\nwith the Montgomery\u2014Asberg Depression Rating Scale.\nThe ethics committee of the Hamadan University of Medical\nSciences (Hamadan, Iran) approved the study, which was\nperformed in accordance with the rules laid down in the\nDeclaration of Helsinki.\n\n2.2. Samples\n\n2.2.1. Patients with major depressive disorders\n\nInpatients with major depressive disorders and with or\nwithout a history of suicide attempts were enrolled in the\nstudy. Inclusion criteria were: 1. age between 18 and\n50 years; 2. diagnosis of a major depressive disorder, as\nascertained by a trained psychiatrist or clinical psychologist,\nand based on a structured clinical interview for psychiatric\ndisorders (M.LN.L; Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview [44]\nbased on the DSM 5; we note that the core symptoms of\nmajor depressive disorders have not changed from the\nDSM-IV to the DSM 5); 3. current stable and continuous\ntreatment with a standard antidepressant; 4. willing and able\nto participate in the study; 5. written informed consent.\nFurther, to be enrolled in the group of patients without\nsuicide attempts: never made a suicide attempt in her/his life.\nNext, to be enrolled in the group of patients with suicide\nattempts: made a suicide attempt within the last three to six\nweeks. Exclusion criteria were: 1. not meeting the inclusion\ncriteria; specifically, reporting a suicide attempt more than\nsix weeks ago; 2. further psychiatric comorbidities, specif-\nically symptoms of depression as a result of substance abuse,\npersistent depressive disorders, disruptive mood dysregula-\ntion disorders, bereavement, posttraumatic stress disorders\n(PTSD), and anxiety disorders; features of psychotic\ndisorders; 3. current state of suicidal behavior.\n\n2.2.2. Suicide attempts\n\nA patient was assigned to the group of patients with a\nhistory of suicide attempts (SAH-MDD), if the following\ncriteria were met: 1. meeting the inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria as described above; 2. suicide attempted between\nthree to six weeks earlier, as reported by the patient and as\nconfirmed by medical records.\n\nCorrespondingly, a patient was assigned to the group of\npatients without a history of suicide attempts (N-SAH-MDD),\nif she/he reported no such attempts during her/his lifetime, and\nif no suicide attempts were mentioned in the medical records.\nAs examples, if a patient had never attempted suicide and met\n\n\n74 M.

Healthy controls\n\nIn parallel, a gender- and age-matched group of healthy\ncontrols (HC) was enrolled. A trained psychiatrist performed\nthe psychiatric interview (M.LN.L; Mini Neuropsychiatric\nInterview), [44] to ensure that the controls had no signs of\npsychopathology. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were: 1.\nage between 18 and 50 years; 2. no signs of psychopathol-\nogy, as ascertained by a psychiatric interview; 3. regular\nfull-time or at least 50% employment; 4. no shift-working; 5.\nno intake of sleep- or mood-altering substances; 6. written\ninformed consent.\n\nParticipants\u2019 socio-demographic and illness-related infor-\nmation are reported in Table 1.\n\nThe three groups did not differ as regard mean age or\ngender distribution; the two patient groups did not differ as\nregard symptoms of depression (self-rating: BDI; experts\u2019\nratings: MADRS), the duration of the current depressive\nepisode, or number of previous depressive episodes.\n\n2.2.4.

Patients completed the Farsi version of the BDI\n[45] (for psychometric properties of the Farsi version:\nGhassemzadeh ct al. [46]). The questionnaire consists of 21\nitems and addresses dimensions such as depressive mood,\nloss of appetite, sleep disorders, suicidality and similar.\n\nEach question has a set of at least four possible responses,\nordered in intensity; c.g. \u2018sadness: 0 = I do not feel sad\u2019;\n1 = \u2018I feel sad\u2019; 2 = \u20181am sad all the time and I can\u2019t snap out\nof it\u2019; 3 = I am so sad or unhappy that I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d\nHigher scores reflecting greater severity of depressive\nsymptoms (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = .85).\n\n2.2.4.2. Experts\u2019 ratings of depression: Montgomery\u2014\nAsberg Depression Rating Scale. Experts rated patients\u201d\nsymptoms of depression with the Montgomery\u2014Asberg\nDepression Rating Scale (MADRS; original: [47]; Farsi\nvalidation: Ahmadpanah et al., [48]). The 10 items forming\nthis scale assess the following symptoms: 1. apparent\nsadness; 2. reported sadness; 3. inner tension; 4. reduced\nsleep; 5. reduced appetite; 6. concentration difficulties; 7.\nlassitude; 8. inability to feel; 9. pessimistic thoughts; 10.\nsuicidal thoughts. Ratings are on a 6-point Likert scale\nranging from 0 (= not at all) to 6 (= definitely), with higher\nscores reflecting more severe symptoms of depression\n(Cronbach\u2019s alpha = .89). Categorization was made as\nfollows [47,48]: 0-6 points: no depression; 7-19 points:\nmild depression; 20-34 points: moderate depression; > 34\npoints: severe depression.\n\n2.2.4.3. Young schema questionnaire.

Differences in early maladaptive schemas between\npatients with major depressive disorders with suicide\nattempts history (SAH-MDD) and without suicide attempts\nhistory (N-SAH-MDD), and healthy controls (HC)\n\nCompared the to the other two groups, patients with MDD and\nsuicide attempt history had higher scores on all five dimensions of\nthe carly maladaptive schema domain disconnection/ejection\n(abandonment/instability; mistrust/abuse; emoti\n\nand failure), and on three out of four dimensions of the domain\nhyper vigilance/inhibition (emotional inhibition, unrelenting\nstandards/hyper criticalness, and punitiveness).\n\nFor the domains of entitlement/grandiosity and other\ndirectedness, patients with MDD and a suicide attempt\nhistory did not have higher (or lower) scores than the patients\nwith MDD without a suicide history or the healthy controls.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe key findings of the present study were that, compared\nto healthy controls, patients with major depressive disorders\nhad higher scores for carly maladaptive schemas. Further, a\nhistory of suicide attempts was associated with higher scores\nfor carly maladaptive schemas in the key domains of\ndisconnection/rejection, impaired autonomy, and hypervigi-\nlant/inhibition. The present pattern of results adds to the\ncurrent literature in showing that suicide attempts among\npatients with MDD are associated with psychological factors,\nand more precisely with carly maladaptive schemas under-\nstood as dysfunctional concepts related to social interaction.\n\nTwo hypotheses were formulated and these are now\nconsidered in turn.\n\nOur first hypothesis was that patients with MDD would\nhave higher scores for carly maladaptive schemas than\nhealthy controls, and this was fully confirmed. In this respect\nthe present results are consistent with findings for patients\nwith addiction disorders [28-30], PTSD [33,43], and for\nthose with obsessive\u2014compulsive disorders [31,32]. How-\never, the present study expands upon previous findings in\nthat this pattern of results related to patients with severe\nmajor depressive disorders as indicated by the BDI (self-\nrating) scores and the MADRS (experts ratings).\n\nOur second hypothesis was that patients with a history of\nsuicide attempts would score higher for carly maladaptive\nschemas than patients without such a history and higher than\nhealthy controls, and again this was confirmed. Accordingly,\nto our knowledge, the present study is the very first to\ndemonstrate a relation between poor carly maladaptive\nschemas and suicide attempts.\n\nTo explain this pattem of results, we draw upon Young\nct als [26] observation that emotional deprivation is\nprobably the most common schema in clinical situations\n[26], and patients with this schema often feel alone,\nfrustrated and sad. Likewise, individuals with such schemas\ndo not expect other people to notice, support or nurture them.\n\n\nM. Ahmadpanah et al. / Comprehensive Psychiatry 77 (2017) 71-79 7\n\nThey feel emotionally deprived, and may feel that they do\nnot receive enough affection and warmth, attention, support\nor strong emotional reaction. They may feel that there is no\none who understands them. These patients may feel that they\nare completely alone in the world. They may feel cheated of\nlove, invisible, and empty. Typically, these patients often do\nnot express their desire for love, affection or emotional needs\nto significant others. Their interactions suggest that they do\nnot need warmth or affection. Since these patients do not\nexpect emotional support, they do not ask for it and\nconsequently usually do not receive it. As a result of these\nemotions and behaviors, depression is inevitable and,\ndepending on the severity and durability of the schema,\nthere is the possibility of suicide attempts. The present\nfindings are consistent with those of Stopa and Waters [51],\nwho investigated the effect of mood on responses to\nthe Young Schema Questionnaire. They showed that\nthe severity of the emotional deprivation schema increased\nafter induction of depressed mood. This reaction suggests\nthat while emotional deprivation causes depression, the\nintensity of a depressed mood increases the severity of this\nschema.\n\nWe found, more specifically, that among patients with\nMDD and a history of suicide attempts the schemas of\nemotional and social detachment were particularly pro-\nnounced. Not surprisingly, this group also had high scores\nfor domains such as disconnection/rejection, impaired\nautonomy/performance and hyper vigilance/inhibition. We\nregard this pattern of results as consistent with concepts\nderived from evolutionary psychology. Specifically, De\nCatanzaro [21] argued that the odds of suicidal behavior\nincrease in inverse proportion to feelings of being attached to\na social group (family, relatives, religious community, etc.),\nand in direct proportion to feelings of being a burden to the\nsocial group and of having little prospect of integration\nwithin a community. Consistent with this view, Bryan and\nRudd [16] observed that the odds of suicide attempts\nincrease with increasing hopelessness, which is in tum\nnegatively associated with the presence of social support and\nhopefulness. Or to put it more briefly, perceived social\nsupport is associated with a lower risk of suicide attempts.\nAlong the same lines, Joiner\u2019s interpersonal\u2014psychological\ntheory of suicide [18,19] proposes that dimensions such as\nperceived burdensomeness (that is, the belief one is a liability\nto other people), and thwarted belongingness (i.c., the belief\nthat one does not belong to a social group, or that one is\nunimportant and useless to other people) increases the risk of\ncommitting suicide. Similarly, O'Connor and Nock [12]\nreported in their review that feelings of defeat, social\nrejection, entrapment, and humiliation, along with subjec-\ntively perceived low social support (all of these reflecting\nnegative and stressful social relation and interactions) appear\nto be at the root of increased risk of committing suicide. We\nbelieve that the dimensions of perceived burdensomeness,\nthwarted belongingness, feelings of defeat, social rejection,\nentrapment, and humiliation, do match with the present\n\nresults, as patients with MDD and with a suicide attempt\nwithin the last three to six weeks also recorded higher scores\non schemas related to interpersonal issues such a social\ndetachment and social isolation/alienation.\n\nDespite the novelty of the findings, several limitations\nwarrant against their overgeneralization. First, the explor-\natory and cross-sectional design precludes any inferences\nabout causal relationships. This holds particularly true as\nregard the association between carly maladaptive schemas\nand symptoms of depression. Even if on a theoretical level\nschemas are assumed to be trait-like cognitive\u2014emotional\nconstructs producing symptoms of depression, influence in\nthe opposite direction is also possible. Second, latent and\nunassessed psychological and physiological factors might\nhave biased two or more dimensions in the same or opposite\ndirections. Specifically, in addition to carly maladaptive\nschemas understood as dysfunctional orientations to social\ninteraction, personality traits such as impulsivity and\nperfectionism, and dysfunctional cognitive information\nprocessing styles such as cognitive rigidity, rumination,\nthought suppression and autobiographical memory bias [12]\nmight be important, but unassessed confounders. Third,\ninformation on the characteristics of the most recent suicide\nattempt, along with the number of previous suicide attempts,\nhistory of attempted and completed suicides by family\nmembers, peers and others in their social environments is\nmissing. Such information might have shed more light on\nthe association between suicide characteristics and carly\nmaladaptive schemas. Fourth and related to this point, it\nwould have been useful to know whether specific circum-\nstances or adverse events had triggered the suicide attempt.\nOn this point, O'Connor and Knock [12] showed that\nimpulsivity as a result of a particularly adverse event was an\noften observed correlate of suicide attempts. Fifth, no\npsychophysiological were assessed, though previous studies\nhave not shown biomarkers to be reliable predictors of\nsuicidal behavior.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe present pattern of results suggests that, compared to\nhealthy controls, higher scores for carly maladaptive\nschemas are characteristic of patients with major depressive\ndisorders. Further, this is particularly true for such patients\nwho also have a history of suicide attempts. We propose that\ncounseling and psychotherapy with patients with MDD\nshould focus more directly on improving patients\u2019 social\nskills and reducing their withdrawal from social interaction.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nWe thank Nick Emler (University of Surrey, Surrey UK)\nfor proofreading the manuscript.\n\n\n78 M.
