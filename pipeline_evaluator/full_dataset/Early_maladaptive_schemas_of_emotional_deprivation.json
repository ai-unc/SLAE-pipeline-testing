This holds particularlytrue for patients with major depressive disorders. The aim of the present study was to explore whether patients with major depressivedisorders (MDD) and a history of suicide attempts differed in their early maladaptive schemas from patients with MDD but without such ahistory or from healthy controls.Method: Ninety participants took part in the study. Of these, 30 were patients with MDD who had made a recent suicide attempt; 30 werepatients with MDD but no suicide attempts, and 30 were gender- and age-matched healthy controls. Participants completed questionnairescovering socio-demographic characteristics and the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ- RE2R) to assess early maladaptive schemas.Experts rated patients' MDD with the Montgomery \u2013Asberg Depression Rating Scale.Results: Patients did not differ in experts' ratings of symptoms of depression. Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD recordedhigher scores on maladaptive schemas such as recognition seeking, negativity/pessimism, and insufficient self-control. Compared to patientswithout suicide attempts and healthy controls, those who had made a suicide attempt had higher scores on dimensions such as failure,mistrust, emotional inhibition, social isolation, and abandonment/instability.Conclusion: Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD had more pronounced maladaptive schemas, but this was more marked inpatients with a history of suicide attempts. The results suggest that suicide attempts and poorer psychological functioning are related.\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionSuicide is the act of deliberately taking one's own life [1],and seems to be unique to Homo sapiens [2]. The averageinternational suicide rate in the general population isapproximately 11 in 100,000 per annum (0.011%/year;[3,4]), and the reported ratio of attempts to completedsuicides (A/S) is approximately 30 \u201350 in 100,000 per annum[3]. As regard suicide in Iran, recent estimates have putprevalence rates at 5.3 per 100,000, with a higher rate formales (7 per 100,000) than for females (3.6 per 100,000; [5]).Suicide and suicidal behavior demand particular attention asthey cause dramatic suffering for those who commit orattempt suicide and for those in their social worlds.Socio-economic and psychiatric explanations have beenadvanced for the complex phenomenon of suicide andsuicidal behavior, but no neurophysiological correlates haveso far been identified [6].Among socio-economic explanations is the propositionthat, at a macro-level, suicide and suicidal behavior mayAvailable online at www.sciencedirect.comScienceDirectComprehensive Psychiatry 77 (2017) 71 \u201379www.elsevier.com/locate/comppsych\u204eCorresponding author at: University of Basel, Psychiatric Clinics(UPK), Center for Affective, Stress and Sleep Disorders (ZASS), WilhelmKlein-Strasse 27, 4002 Basel, Switzerland.

However, recentfindings from Greece [8]have not supported this notionwhen factors such as psychiatric disorders and the socialenvironment are taken into at account. Nonetheless, on amicro-level, economic hardship has been reported as one ofseveral factors in attempted suicide in Iran [9].Next, evidence from psychiatry points to a closeassociation of suicide and suicidal behavior with psychiatricdisorders [1,10] , and specifically with major depressivedisorders [11,12] . Further, Ajdacic-Gross [13] reported thefollowing increases in suicide risk (compared to healthycontrols): patients immediately following discharge,200-fold increase; patients during stay in psychiatrichospitals, 50-fold increase; more than one psychiatricdiagnose within the last 4 weeks, 90-fold increase; differentpsychiatric diagnoses, 10 \u201325-fold increase. With respect tocompleted suicides, Arsenault-Lapierre et al. [10]reported intheir meta-analysis the following: a) a mental disorder wasdiagnosed in 87% of the 3275 cases included in the studies, b)with respect to gender, diagnoses of substance-relatedproblems, personality disorders, and childhood disorderswere more common among male suicides, while affectivedisorders, including depressive disorders, were more commonamong female suicides. More specifically, suicide and suicidalbehavior were associated with bipolar and unipolar mooddisorders [1,14] . In the present study, we focused on majordepressive disorders, as depression contributes most strongly tosuicide attempts (population attributable risk (PAR) of 26.6%;[12,15,16] ). In this view and most importantly, Pompili et al.[11]showed that, among patients with MDD, non-adherencewas a significant predictor of negative outcomes such as highrates of recurrence/relapse and active suicidal ideation andsuicidal behavior. A positive history of non-adherence has alsobeen associated with both prior suicide attempts and activesuicidal ideation. Improving adherence generally may preventsuicidal behaviors. We took this observation into account; inthe present study we investigated inpatients under stable andsupervised psychopharmacological treatment.Research based on neurophysiological approaches tounderstanding suicidal behavior has not produced satisfac-tory prediction rates. Thus, while some researchers haveclaimed that dramatically lower cholesterol levels predictsuicidal behavior, this has not been the case in other studies(see Shakeri et al. [17]for more detail; they concluded thatmost probably a broad variety of socio-demographic, social,physiological and psychological factors impact concomi-tantly and independently on suicidal behavior).In the present study we focused on psychological dimensionsto gain more insight into the cognitive \u2013emotional processes thatmight underlie suicidal behavior. To this end, patients withmajor depressive disorders (MDD) and with or without a historyof suicide attempts completed the Young Schema Questionnaireto assess early maladaptive schemas. More specifically, weanticipated that patients with such a history would be morefocused on interpersonal relationship issues such as disconnec-tion, rejection, inhibition, and abandonment, when comparedeither to patients without this history or to healthy controls. Inthis respect, Joiner et al. [18]and Bryan et al. [19]argue that,among other factors, interpersonal \u2013psychological dimensionssuch as perceived burdensomeness (that is, the belief to beliability to other people), and thwarted belongingness (i.e., thebelief that one does not belong to a social group, or to beunimportant and useless to other people) increase the risk ofcommitting suicide. Likewise, O \u2032Connor and Nock [12]concluded in their review that feelings of defeat, social rejection,entrapment, and humiliation, along with subjectively perceivedlow social support (all reflecting negative and stressful socialrelation and interactions) were particular contributors toincreased risk of committing su icide. We took these observa-tions into account and asked to what extent inpatients withmajor depressive disorders and with a recent history of suicideattempts might differ in their early maladaptive schemas,compared to inpatients with major depressive disorders butwithout any suicide attempts.According to Beck's cognitive view of the emergence andmaintenance of depression [20], mental concepts such as theassumptions, schemas, memories, beliefs, goals, expecta-tions, hopes, plans, assignments and cognitive biases ofpersons influence their behavioral and emotional responsesto the social environment [20]. Such mental concepts mightbe particularly biased in people with suicidal ideation andbehavior, and this reasoning also draws on the concept ofevolutionary psychology. According to De Catanzaro [21]and Joiner [18] people are more prone to suicide the lessattached they feel to a social group (family, relatives,religious society, etc.), the more of a burden they feel to thesocial group, and the weaker they feel the prospects to be ofbecoming integrated within a social community. Thus, wewould expect a higher salience of issues related to socialinteraction among patients with suicide attempt history thanamong those without (see also [22\u201324]).According to Ball and Cecero [25], after becoming acute,early maladaptive schemas act as personality traits, and weexpected greater prevalence of early maladaptive schemas inpeople suffering from MDD, and more so among those witha history of suicide attempts [25]. According to Young et al.[26], schemas that are foundations for later psychologicaldisorders can be described as maladaptive. Early maladap-tive schemas are self-defeating emotional and cognitivepatterns established in childhood and repeated throughoutlife. Following Young et al. [26]and Arntz and Gitta [27],1 8maladaptive schemas are identified, and grouped into fiveschema domains as follows:A: The first domain concerns disconnection/rejectionand includes five schemas formed as a consequenceof unmet needs such as security and empathy. Theseare abandonment/instability, mistrust/abuse, emo-tional deprivation, defectiveness/shame, and socialisolation/alienation.B: The second domain includes schemas centered onimpaired autonomy/performance, schemas formed72 M. Ahmadpanah et al. / Comprehensive Psychiatry 77 (2017) 71 \u201379in the context of families in which children'sself-esteem is belittled and their autonomy under-mined. These are: dependence/incompetence, vul-nerability to harm or il lness, enmeshment/undeveloped self, failure.C: The third domain includes the schemas of entitlement/grandiosity, and insufficient self-control/self-discipline, which focus on lack of commitment,irresponsibility and lack of r espects for others' rightsor appreciation of limits.D: With an emphasis on extreme attention to others'needs and emotions, the fourth domain is namedother-directedness and includes three schemas: sub-jugation, self-sacrifice, and approval-seeking/recognition-seeking.E: The fifth domain is hype r vigilance/inhibition. Itincludes four schemas: negativity/pessimism, emo-tional inhibition, unrelentin g standards/hypercritical-ness, and punitiveness.Studies have shown that early maladaptive schemas playpivotal roles in addiction [28\u201330], obsessive/compulsivedisorder [31,32] , PTSD [33\u201336], and depression and anxiety[37]. However, while there are at least three different studiesexamining early maladaptive schemas and suicidal behavioramong patients with BPD [38,39] and borderline personalitydisorders [40], to the best of our knowledge no research has yetlooked at patients with MDD and suicidal behavior. We believesuch research could contribute to improvements in counselingand prevention and could decrease the risk of suicidal behavior.Specifically, counseling might focus on strengthening patients'social skills and interactional behavior; Brand et al. [41]showed that, among patients with environment-related com-plaints, poor interaction was related to psychiatric complaints.Furthermore, Jahangard et al. [42] showed that trainingemotional intelligence was feasible and had the effect ofreducing symptoms of depression and raising social skillsamong patients with borderline personality disorders.The following hypotheses were formulated. First, fol-lowing Akbarian et al. [33], Ahmadian et al. [43], Beck [20],and others, we expected that, compared to healthy controls,patients with major depressive disorders would have higherscores for early maladaptive schemas. Second, following DeCatanzaro [21], Joiner et al. [18], and Arsenault-Lepierre etal.[10],O\u2032Connor and Nock [12], and Bryan et al. [16]weanticipated that, compared to healthy controls and to patientswith MDD but with no history of suicide attempts, patientswith MDD and a history of suicide attempts would havehigher scores for early maladaptive schemas.2. Method2.1. ProcedureInpatients of the Sina and Farshchian Hospitals (Hamadan,Iran) with major depressive disorders were approached toparticipate in the present cross-sectional study. Healthy age-and gender-matched controls were also recruited. Alleligible participants were informed about the aims of thestudy, and the voluntary basis of participation. Once writteninformed consent was signed, participants completedquestionnaires covering soci o-demographic variables, theBeck Depression Inventory (see below) and the YoungSchema Questionnaire (YSQ- RE2R; see below) to assessearly maladaptive schemas. Experts conducted a psychiatricinterview to diagnose major dep ressive disorders accordingto the DSM 5, and rated patients' major depressive disorderswith the Montgomery \u2013Asberg Depression Rating Scale.The ethics committee of the Hamadan University of MedicalSciences (Hamadan, Iran) approved the study, which wasperformed in accordance with the rules laid down in theDeclaration of Helsinki.2.2. Samples2.2.1. Patients with major depressive disordersInpatients with major depressive disorders and with orwithout a history of suicide attempts were enrolled in thestudy. Inclusion criteria were: 1. age between 18 and50 years; 2. diagnosis of a major depressive disorder, asascertained by a trained psychiatrist or clinical psychologist,and based on a structured clinical interview for psychiatricdisorders (M.I.N.I.; Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview [44]based on the DSM 5; we note that the core symptoms ofmajor depressive disorders have not changed from theDSM-IV to the DSM 5); 3. current stable and continuoustreatment with a standard antidepressant; 4. willing and ableto participate in the study; 5. written informed consent.Further, to be enrolled in the group of patients withoutsuicide attempts: never made a suicide attempt in her/his life.Next, to be enrolled in the group of patients with suicideattempts: made a suicide attempt within the last three to sixweeks. Exclusion criteria were: 1. not meeting the inclusioncriteria; specifically, reporting a suicide attempt more thansix weeks ago; 2. further psychiatric comorbidities, specif-ically symptoms of depression as a result of substance abuse,persistent depressive disorders, disruptive mood dysregula-tion disorders, bereavement, posttraumatic stress disorders(PTSD), and anxiety disorders; features of psychoticdisorders; 3. current state of suicidal behavior.2.2.2. Suicide attemptsA patient was assigned to the group of patients with ahistory of suicide attempts (SAH-MDD), if the followingcriteria were met: 1. meeting the inclusion and exclusioncriteria as described above; 2. suicide attempted betweenthree to six weeks earlier, as reported by the patient and asconfirmed by medical records.Correspondingly, a patient was assigned to the group ofpatients without a history of suicide attempts (N-SAH-MDD),if she/he reported no such attempts during her/his lifetime, andif no suicide attempts were mentioned in the medical records.As examples, if a patient had never attempted suicide and met73 M. Ahmadpanah et al. / Comprehensive Psychiatry 77 (2017) 71 \u201379all inclusion and exclusion criteria, she or he was assigned tothe group of N-SAH-MDD. If a patient had made a suicideattempt in the last three to six weeks, she or he was assigned tothe group of SAH-MDD. If a patient had made a suicideattempt but more than six weeks ago, she or he was notenrolled in the present study. In all, 189 patients wereapproached to achieve the target sample sizes of 30 patients percondition (2 \u00d7 30 = 60 patients; 31.74%).2.2.3. Healthy controlsIn parallel, a gender- and age-matched group of healthycontrols (HC) was enrolled. A trained psychiatrist performedthe psychiatric interview (M.I.N.I.; Mini NeuropsychiatricInterview), [44] to ensure that the controls had no signs ofpsychopathology. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were: 1.age between 18 and 50 years; 2. no signs of psychopathol-ogy, as ascertained by a psychiatric interview; 3. regularfull-time or at least 50% employment; 4. no shift-working; 5.no intake of sleep- or mood-altering substances; 6. writteninformed consent.Participants' socio-demographic and illness-related infor-mation are reported in Table 1 .The three groups did not differ as regard mean age orgender distribution; the two patient groups did not differ asregard symptoms of depression (self-rating: BDI; experts'ratings: MADRS), the duration of the current depressiveepisode, or number of previous depressive episodes.2.2.4. Tools2.2.4.1. Depression; self-rating Beck depression inventory(BDI). Patients completed the Farsi version of the BDI[45] (for psychometric properties of the Farsi version:Ghassemzadeh et al. [46]). The questionnaire consists of 21items and addresses dimensions such as depressive mood,loss of appetite, sleep disorders, suicidality and similar.Each question has a set of at least four possible responses,ordered in intensity; e.g. \u2018sadness \u2019:0= \u2018Id on o tf e e ls a d \u2019;1= \u2018If e e ls a d \u2019;2= \u2018I am sad all the time and I can't snap outof it \u2019;3= \u2018I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it. \u2019Higher scores reflecting gr eater severity of depressivesymptoms (Cronbach's alpha = .85).2.2.4.2. Experts' ratings of depression: Montgomery \u2013Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Experts rated patients'symptoms of depression with the Montgomery \u2013AsbergDepression Rating Scale (MADRS; original: [47]; Farsivalidation: Ahmadpanah et al., [48]). The 10 items formingthis scale assess the following symptoms: 1. apparentsadness; 2. reported sadness; 3. inner tension; 4. reducedsleep; 5. reduced appetite; 6. concentration difficulties; 7.lassitude; 8. inability to feel; 9. pessimistic thoughts; 10.suicidal thoughts. Ratings are on a 6-point Likert scaleranging from 0 (= not at all) to 6 (= definitely), with higherscores reflecting more severe symptoms of depression(Cronbach's alpha = .89). Categorization was made asfollows [47,48] :0\u20136 points: no depression; 7 \u201319 points:mild depression; 20 \u201334 points: moderate depression; N34points: severe depression.2.2.4.3. Young schema questionnaire. The Young SchemaQuestionnaire \u2013Long Form [49] (Farsi validation: [50])consists of 232 items and assesses 18 different schemasacross five schema domains (see Table 2 and Introduction).Answers are given on 6-point Likert scales with the anchorpoints 1 (= not at all true) to 6 (= completely true); highertotal scores reflect more marked early maladaptive schemas(Cronbach's alphas from 0.83 to 0.89).2.2.4.4. Medications. All participants in the two patientgroups were receiving treat ment with antidepressants(citalopram; escitalopram; v enlafaxine, mirtazapine,Table 1Statistical indices (descriptive and inferential statistics) for socio-demographic information, illness-related data and values of self-repor ted (BDI) and experts'reported (MADRS) symptoms of depression, separately for the three groups: Patients with major depressive disorders and a history of suicide attempt s[SAH-MDD]; patients with major depressive disorders without a history of suicide attempts [N-SAH-MDD], and healthy controls [HC].Study conditions StatisticsSAH-MDD N-SAH-MDD HCN3 0 3 0 3 0Gender (female/male) 21/9 19/11 18/12 X2(N = 90, df = 1) = 0.98, p N0.6M (SD) M (SD) M (SD)Age (years) 45.34 (8.94) 44.73 (7.34) 45.40 (4.87) F(2, 87) = 0.29, p N0.7BDI (self-rating) 37.60 (7.23) 38.93 (5.80) 2.85 (0.871) F(2, 87) = 19.34, p b0.001MADRS (experts' ratings) 36.43 (6.45) 37.00 (9.02) 1.90 (0.74) F(2, 87) = 25.34, p b0.001Duration of current episode (months) 2.45 (1.45) 1.98 (0.99) - t(58) = 0.67, p = 0.65Number of episodes 3.45 (2.13) 3.00 (3.12) - t(58) = 0.54, p = 0.71Antidepressants (number of participants)citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine,mirtazapine, trazodone, fluoxetine,trimipramine, moclobemide)9/9/4/2/3/1/2/0 6/7/6/3/3/2/2/1 - X2(N = 60, df = 7) = 0.02, p = .98BDI = Beck Depression Inventory; MADRS = Montgomery \u2013Asberg Depression Rating Scale.74 M.

Statistical analysisA series of one-way ANOVAs (three groups: SAH-MDD;N-SAH-MDD; HC) was performed to calculate differences onsocio-demographic dimensions (age) and with respect tosymptoms of depression (BDI, MADRS). A X2-test wasperformed to calculate gender distribution between the threegroups. Next, t-tests (two groups: SAH-MDD; N-SAH-MDD)were performed to calculate differences in the duration of thecurrent episode and in the number of depressive episodes.A series of multivariate ANOVAs (three groups:SAH-MDD; N-SAH-MDD; HC) w as performed to calculatedifferences in early maladaptive schemas. Post-hoc analyseswere performed with Bonferroni-Holm corrections for p-values.The statistics was performed with SPSS\u00ae 24.0 (IBM Corpora-tion, Armonk NY, USA) for Apple MacIntosh\u00ae.3. Results3.1. Differences in early maladaptive schemas betweenpatients with major depre ssive disorders (MDD) andhealthy controls (HC)Table 2 reports all descriptive and inferential statisticalindices; accordingly, statistical indices are not reported in the text.The pattern of results is as follows: compared to healthycontrols, patients with major depressive disorders hadsignificantly higher scores for early maladaptive schemas.3.2. Differences in early maladaptive schemas betweenpatients with major depressive disorders with suicideattempts history (SAH-MDD) and without suicide attemptshistory (N-SAH-MDD), and healthy controls (HC)Again, Table 2 reports all descriptive and inferentialstatistical indices; accordingly, statistical indices are notreported in the text.Compared the to the other two groups, patients with MDD andsuicide attempt history had higher scores on all five dimensions ofthe early maladaptive schema domain disconnection/rejection(abandonment/instability; mistrus t/abuse; emotional deprivation;defectiveness/shame, and social isolation/alienation), on three outof four dimensions of the domain Impaired autonomy(dependence/incompetence; vulnerability to harm and illness,and failure), and on three out of four dimensions of the domainhyper vigilance/inhibition (emo tional inhibition, unrelentingstandards/hyper criticalness, and punitiveness).For the domains of entitlement/grandiosity and otherdirectedness, patients with MDD and a suicide attempthistory did not have higher (or lower) scores than the patientswith MDD without a suicide history or the healthy controls.4. DiscussionThe key findings of the present study were that, comparedto healthy controls, patients with major depressive disordershad higher scores for early maladaptive schemas. Further, ahistory of suicide attempts was associated with higher scoresfor early maladaptive schemas in the key domains ofdisconnection/rejection, impaired autonomy, and hypervigi-lant/inhibition. The present pattern of results adds to thecurrent literature in showing that suicide attempts amongpatients with MDD are associated with psychological factors,and more precisely with early maladaptive schemas under-stood as dysfunctional concepts related to social interaction.Two hypotheses were formulated and these are nowconsidered in turn.Our first hypothesis was that patients with MDD wouldhave higher scores for early maladaptive schemas thanhealthy controls, and this was fully confirmed. In this respectthe present results are consistent with findings for patientswith addiction disorders [28\u201330], PTSD [33,43] , and forthose with obsessive \u2013compulsive disorders [31,32] . How-ever, the present study expands upon previous findings inthat this pattern of results related to patients with severemajor depressive disorders as indicated by the BDI (self-rating) scores and the MADRS (experts' ratings).Our second hypothesis was that patients with a history ofsuicide attempts would score higher for early maladaptiveschemas than patients without such a history and higher thanhealthy controls, and again this was confirmed. Accordingly,to our knowledge, the present study is the very first todemonstrate a relation between poor early maladaptiveschemas and suicide attempts.To explain this pattern of results, we draw upon Younget al.'s [26] observation that emotional deprivation isprobably the most common schema in clinical situations[26], and patients with this schema often feel alone,frustrated and sad. Likewise, individuals with such schemasdo not expect other people to notice, support or nurture them.Table 2 ( continued )Early maladaptive schema Group Mean (SD) F (df = 2, 87) Group comparisons with Bonferroni \u2013Holm corrections for p-valuesHC 14.13 (4.22)Punitiveness SA-MDD 24.47 (3.82) 61.50 \u204e\u204e\u204e SA-MDD; N-SA-MDD NHCN-SA-MDD 20.77 (2.10) SA-MDD NN- SA-MDDHC 7.73 (1.95)\u204e\u204eP\u22640.01; \u204e\u204e\u204eP\u22640.001.76 M. Ahmadpanah et al. / Comprehensive Psychiatry 77 (2017) 71 \u201379They feel emotionally deprived, and may feel that they donot receive enough affection and warmth, attention, supportor strong emotional reaction. They may feel that there is noone who understands them. These patients may feel that theyare completely alone in the world. They may feel cheated oflove, invisible, and empty. Typically, these patients often donot express their desire for love, affection or emotional needsto significant others. Their interactions suggest that they donot need warmth or affection. Since these patients do notexpect emotional support, they do not ask for it andconsequently usually do not receive it. As a result of theseemotions and behaviors, depression is inevitable and,depending on the severity and durability of the schema,there is the possibility of suicide attempts. The presentfindings are consistent with those of Stopa and Waters [51],who investigated the effect of mood on responses tothe Young Schema Questionnaire. They showed thatthe severity of the emotional deprivation schema increasedafter induction of depressed mood. This reaction suggeststhat while emotional deprivation causes depression, theintensity of a depressed mood increases the severity of thisschema.We found, more specifically, that among patients withMDD and a history of suicide attempts the schemas ofemotional and social detachment were particularly pro-nounced. Not surprisingly, this group also had high scoresfor domains such as disconnection/rejection, impairedautonomy/performance and hyper vigilance/inhibition. Weregard this pattern of results as consistent with conceptsderived from evolutionary psychology. Specifically, DeCatanzaro [21] argued that the odds of suicidal behaviorincrease in inverse proportion to feelings of being attached toa social group (family, relatives, religious community, etc.),and in direct proportion to feelings of being a burden to thesocial group and of having little prospect of integrationwithin a community. Consistent with this view, Bryan andRudd [16] observed that the odds of suicide attemptsincrease with increasing hopelessness, which is in turnnegatively associated with the presence of social support andhopefulness. Or to put it more briefly, perceived socialsupport is associated with a lower risk of suicide attempts.Along the same lines, Joiner's interpersonal \u2013psychologicaltheory of suicide [18,19] proposes that dimensions such asperceived burdensomeness (that is, the belief one is a liabilityto other people), and thwarted belongingness (i.e., the beliefthat one does not belong to a social group, or that one isunimportant and useless to other people) increases the risk ofcommitting suicide. Similarly, O \u2032Connor and Nock [12]reported in their review that feelings of defeat, socialrejection, entrapment, and humiliation, along with subjec-tively perceived low social support (all of these reflectingnegative and stressful social relation and interactions) appearto be at the root of increased risk of committing suicide. Webelieve that the dimensions of perceived burdensomeness,thwarted belongingness, feelings of defeat, social rejection,entrapment, and humiliation, do match with the presentresults, as patients with MDD and with a suicide attemptwithin the last three to six weeks also recorded higher scoreson schemas related to interpersonal issues such a socialdetachment and social isolation/alienation.Despite the novelty of the findings, several limitationswarrant against their overgener alization. First, the explor-atory and cross-sectional design precludes any inferencesabout causal relationships. T his holds particularly true asregard the association betw een early maladaptive schemasand symptoms of depression. Even if on a theoretical levelschemas are assumed to be trait-like cognitive \u2013emotionalconstructs producing symptoms of depression, influence inthe opposite direction is also possible. Second, latent andunassessed psychological and physiological factors mighthave biased two or more dimensions in the same or oppositedirections. Specifically, in addition to early maladaptiveschemas understood as dysfunctional orientations to socialinteraction, personality traits such as impulsivity andperfectionism, and dysfunc tional cognitive informationprocessing styles such as co gnitive rigidity, rumination,thought suppression and autobiographical memory bias [12]might be important, but unassessed confounders. Third,information on the characteristics of the most recent suicideattempt, along with the number of previous suicide attempts,history of attempted and completed suicides by familymembers, peers and others in their social environments ismissing. Such information might have shed more light onthe association between sui cide characteristics and earlymaladaptive schemas. Fourth and related to this point, itw o u l dh a v eb e e nu s e f u lt ok n o w whether specific circum-stances or adverse events had triggered the suicide attempt.On this point, O \u2032Connor and Knock [12] showed thatimpulsivity as a result of a par ticularly adverse event was anoften observed correlate of suicide attempts. Fifth, nopsychophysiological were assessed, though previous studieshave not shown biomarkers to be reliable predictors ofsuicidal behavior.5. ConclusionsThe present pattern of results suggests that, compared tohealthy controls, higher scores for early maladaptiveschemas are characteristic of patients with major depressivedisorders. Further, this is part icularly true for such patientswho also have a history of suicide attempts. We propose thatcounseling and psychotherapy with patients with MDDshould focus more directly on improving patients' socialskills and reducing their withdr awal from social interaction.AcknowledgmentWe thank Nick Emler (University of Surrey, Surrey UK)for proofreading the manuscript.77 M.
