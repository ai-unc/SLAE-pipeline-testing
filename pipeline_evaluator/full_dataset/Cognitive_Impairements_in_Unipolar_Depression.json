Karger AG, Basel  Introduction  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with a wide range of affective and somatic symptoms as well as cognitive impairments in the acute state  [1\u20134]   and may be long lasting despite symptom reduction and recovery  [5, 6]  . Rumination is often discussed as an important po-tential underlying cognitive mechanisms in the context of cognitive impairments in MDD. Rumination is a style of thinking characterized by repetitive, recurrent, intrusive, and uncontrollable thoughts  [7] . These persistent nega-tive thoughts are a hallmark feature of MDD. People who ruminate repetitively contemplate reasons for and conse-quences of their sadness  [8] .

People with depression also tend to focus on and think about their prob-lems (\u201cruminate\u201d) more than people without depression. Re-cent studies indicate that depressive rumination is connect-ed to cognitive impairments in MDD. However, there is little scientific understanding of the role of rumination in these deficits.  Sampling and Methods:   The current study exam-ined the performance of 62 outpatients suffering from uni-polar major depression with a low tendency to ruminate ver-sus outpatients with a high tendency to ruminate using a neuropsychological battery covering the 5 cognitive do-mains: attention, memory, working memory, executive func-tions and processing speed.  Results:   The results indicated that high ruminators show a lower performance than low ruminators with regard to processing speed and executive function tasks with low effect sizes. However, these findings were not significant after Bonferroni correction.

Moreover, rumination has been identified as a core risk factor for depression with serious clinical im-plications due to more depressed mood, longer depres-sive episodes and the occurrence of future depressive ep-isodes  [7\u201310]  . Recent studies indicate that depressive ru-mination is connected to cognitive impairments in MDD. It is discussed as an important underlying cognitive mechanism. However, there is little understanding of the extent to which rumination influences cognitive perfor-mance, especially in single domains.  Rumination and Cognitive Impairments   Resource allocation theory posits that rumination ab-sorbs cognitive capacities which can thus not be directed towards task-relevant processes  [11\u201313]  . According to this theory, valuable cognitive resources are allocated to irrelevant depressive and ruminative thought processes. Indeed, there are many findings that support the link be-tween reduced cognitive performance and rumination as put forward in the dual-process model of cognitive vul-nerability in depressed persons. According to this model, the ability of depressed individuals to implement correc-tive reflective processing in order to overcome automatic negative biases is impaired, because this processing re-quires effort and cognitive resources that are not available  [14] . Thus, rumination might reduce  cognitive flexibility   and raise interference levels above a critical threshold. In line with these results, Davis and Nolen-Hoeksema  [15]  showed that participants who scored high on a self-report measure of ruminative style made more perseverative er-rors than nonruminators in the Wisconsin card sorting test, a widely used measure of  executive control   and  cogni-tive flexibility  .  In addition, the dual-process model posits that the cognitive resources of depressed individuals might al-ready be strained by competing mood-congruent and ru-minative thought processes  [14] . In particular the brood-ing, maladaptive component of rumination has been found to be associated with higher negative  attentional biases    [16] , suggesting that depressed individuals with high levels of brooding have tightly connected negative schemata from which they have difficulty in breaking away. Some scholars, on the other hand, have related ru-mination to major deficits in  cognitive control  , regardless of the valence of the processed material. Specifically, ru-minators are thought to exhibit an impaired ability to flexibly shift  attention   or  inhibit  irrelevant information [e.g.  15 ,  17 ].  Previous research has also reported that rumination is related to  memory deficits   and  memory biases   [18, 19]  . For example, when people are asked to recall memories of specific autobiographical events, depressed patients are more likely to retrieve overgeneral, categorical memories that are summaries of repeated occasions than controls [for a review, see  20 ]. Watkins et al.  [21]  found that the distraction induction (as a composite of rumination in-duction) significantly reduced overgeneral memory at preinduction levels.   Rumination has also been associated with  working memory   deficits. Joormann and Gotlib  [22]  proved a link between rumination, impaired  working memory,   and de-pression. They found that the interference of negative ir-relevant words was correlated with self-reported rumina-tion. This relation with rumination was limited to the MDD group and remained significant even after partial-ing out the level of depressive symptomatology: the high-er the participants\u2019 scored for the self-reported measure of rumination, the greater their difficulty in removing task-irrelevant negative content from their working memory. The connection between rumination and im-paired working memory was also reported by other au-thors  [23, 24]  .  There have also been several experimental research studies on the effect of induced rumination on  executive functions   [e.g.  25\u201327  ]. In the study by Watkins and Brown  [13] , for example, the performance of depressed patients and nondepressed controls was compared for a random number generation task, performed after either a rumina-tion or a distraction induction. Compared with the dis-traction induction, the rumination induction produced a significant increase in stereotyped counting responses (reflecting a failure of inhibitory executive control) in de-pressed patients but not in controls. However, after dis-traction, no difference was found between the 2 groups. The authors concluded that the rumination induction may interfere with concurrent executive processing.  In sum, findings from the studies reviewed above ten-tatively support a connection between rumination and deficits in cognitive performance. However, previous re-search on the impact of rumination on cognitive impair-ments in MDD has a number of shortcomings and has left open questions of which 3 seem especially important:   Previous studies reported the influence of ruminative thinking on memory, attention, or executive functions. However, most studies have assessed only 1 or very few aspects of the specific domains such as attentional inflex-ibility, cognitive control, cognitive inflexibility, or task switching. So far there have been no studies that system-Downloaded from http://karger.com/psp/article-pdf/50/5/347/3492414/000478785.pdf by UNC Chapel Hill user on 09 January 2024 Cognitive Impairments in Unipolar Depression Psychopathology 2017;50:347\u2013354DOI: 10.1159/000478785349atically examine all cognitive domains. Therefore, gen-eral knowledge on the impact of rumination on different cognitive domains in MDD is still very limited.  Furthermore, many studies on rumination and cogni-tive dysfunctions have not controlled for the influence of other factors such as the severity of depression, the amount of depressive episodes in the past, medication or duration of the current episode. Previous research has shown that these factors can strongly influence the extent of cognitive deficits in MDD  [28] . Moreover, it seems es-sential to control for general factors such as age, patients\u2019 intelligence, or level of education  [29] . However, these factors have not been taken into consideration so far.   Previous investigations have also failed to explore the relationship between rumination in everyday life and cognitive performance. Most studies have assessed the in-fluence of rumination in an experimental design, which required participants to complete several cognitive tasks after introducing rumination. Therefore, it stands to rea-son that rumination induced shortly before examination has an impact on the ability to solve cognitive tasks. How-ever, it is unclear as to whether depressive patients who ruminate a lot about themselves and their diseases in ev-eryday life also exhibit higher cognitive impairments than depressive patients whose tendency to ruminate in every-day life is not as pronounced.  The current study aims at answering the above-men-tioned questions, thus closing a gap in research by sys-tematically analyzing the relationship between assessed everyday-life rumination and different cognitive func-tions in MDD by controlling for as many influencing fac-tors as possible. Based on previous research, we hypoth-esize that the severity of cognitive deficits in MDD is re-lated to ruminative thinking.  Methods  Participants  The sample consisted of 62 outpatients (age 18\u201366 years, mean = 43.32, SD = 12.93, 46 female) currently diagnosed with MDD. All participants fully met the criteria for a current unipolar MDD episode of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders   (4th ed., text rev., DSM-IV-TR  [30] ) on the basis of the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID-I  [31] ). They were recruited for the study from a university teaching outpatient clinic. Thirteen participants were diagnosed with comorbidity in addition to MDD: dysthymia (10 participants), bulimia nervosa (2 participants), and undifferentiated somatoform disorder (1 par-ticipant). Participants with comorbid anxiety disorder, posttrau-matic stress disorder, substance dependence, a history of head in-jury, neurological disease, opioid or antipsychotic medication were excluded. The clinical sample was divided into 2 groups: low ruminators and high ruminators based on their scores on the Re-sponse Style Questionnaire, German version (RSQ-D)  [32] , with a sum score of 40 and above indicating high rumination. Thirty-six participants (22% of low ruminators and 38% of high ruminators) were taking antidepressants. Twenty-two participants were taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 5 selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, 11 noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants, 5 tricyclic antidepressants, and 1 was taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.  Measures  Hamilton Depression Rating Scale  The 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)  [33]  was used. The HAMD is the most commonly used clinical scale to assess the severity of depression in clinical practice and research  [34] .  Response Styles Questionnaire, German Version  The RSQ  [32]  is a self-report instrument that assesses the ten-dency to respond to negative emotions with ruminative thoughts. Participants respond to items on a 4-point scale anchored by \u201cal-most never\u201d and \u201calmost always.\u201d The authors report high test-retest reliability and internal consistency for the RSQ-D.  Neuropsychological Assessment  The neuropsychological tests were taken from the COGBAT test battery of the Vienna test system  [35] . The test set measures subdimensions in the areas of attention, memory, verbal working memory, executive functions, and processing speed and has been validated across neurological and psychiatric populations.  Procedure  All participants were recruited from the outpatient psychother-apy clinic of the University of Landau, Germany, where they asked for psychotherapy. As it is usual routine of the outpatient clinic, potential patients were invited for a first screening interview. If depressive symptoms were identified and were of major concern to the patients, they were informed of the study. If they agreed to participate, informed consent was obtained.   The assessment was divided into two 1-h sessions. In the first session, trained interviewers administered the structured clinical Interview for the DSM-IV  [36]  to participants to ensure that they fully met the criteria for a current unipolar MDD episode. After-wards participants were interviewed regarding further criteria for being included in or excluded from the study and were rated on the HAMD  [33] . In a next step, they completed the RSQ-D  [32] . A few days after the first session, participants came to our laboratory to complete the cognitive tasks with the neuropsychological test battery COGBAT. All participants were tested individually after having completed the informed consent form. The research was approved by the Local Research Ethics Committees.  Statistical Analysis  All statistical comparisons were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows, version 21). The neuropsychological test scores were transformed into stan-dardized ( z ) scores and polarized in 1 direction (with higher scores indicating a better performance). Performance was calculated sep-arately for the 5 cognitive domains of information-processing speed, attention, verbal working memory, memory, and executive Downloaded from http://karger.com/psp/article-pdf/50/5/347/3492414/000478785.pdf by UNC Chapel Hill user on 09 January 2024 Schwert/Aschenbrenner/Weisbrod/Schr\u00f6der Psychopathology 2017;50:347\u2013354DOI: 10.1159/000478785350function by combining the test scores, shown in  Table\u00a01 , in accor-dance with the published recommendations (Wiener Test-System, 2012, M\u00f6dling, Schuhfried GmbH). These scores demonstrated an acceptable internal consistency ranging from \u03b1 = 0.63 (attention) to \u03b1 = 0.95 (memory).  In the preliminary analyses  t  tests were conducted to compare the group of depressive patients ( n = 62  ) with the normative data of COGBAT ( n  = 62) matched on gender, age, and education level on cognitive performance. Further  t  tests were conducted to com-pare the differences between low- and high-rumination groups on the same cognitive domains. The relation between rumination and distinct domains of cognitive performance was examined through a series of hierarchical regression analyses. In each analysis the general factors age, years of education and gender were entered into the model in step 1. In step 2, depression-related variables \u2013 number of depressive episodes in the past, severity of depression (score on the HAMD), intake of medication and duration of the current episode \u2013 were included into the model. Finally, in step 3, the rumination score was added to the model.  Results  The descriptive statistics for the main study variables, separated according to the level of rumination (low vs. high) are presented in  Table\u00a02 . There were no significant differences in age, years of education, amount of past de-pressive episodes, and duration of current depressive ep-isode as well as HAMD score between the groups. The 2 groups only differed significantly on the RSQ-D score.   The results of the  t  tests comparing the differences be-tween depressive patients and normative data indicate a worse performance of the patients in processing speed tasks ( t (60) = 2.59;  p  < 0.05; Cohen\u2019s  d  = 0.47), attention tasks ( t (60)  =  4.69;  p  < 0.001; Cohen\u2019s  d  = 0.84), memory tasks ( t (59)  =  3.84;  p  < 0.001; Cohen\u2019s  d  = 0.69), verbal working memory tasks ( t (60)  =  1.61; ns; Cohen\u2019s  d  = 0.29), and executive function tasks ( t (60)  =  2.64;  p  < 0.01; Cohen\u2019s  d  = 0.47). The results of the  t  tests relating to the different rumination groups are presented in  Table\u00a03 . The findings indicate that high ruminators perform worse than low ru-minators in processing speed tasks ( t (59)  =  1.70;  p  < 0.05; Cohen\u2019s  d  = 0.41) and executive function tasks ( t (60)  =  1.82;  p  < 0.05; Cohen\u2019s  d  = 0.48) with low effect sizes. How-ever, the results become nonsignificant after Bonferroni-Holm \u03b1-level adjustment (\u03b1 fam  = 0.05,  s =  5 comparisons). Table 1.

The addition of the rumination score in step 3 only produced a significant in-crement in  R  2  for the processing speed tasks (\u03b2 = \u20130.22; \u0394 R  2  = 0.05;  p  < 0.05). For the executive function tasks, adding rumination led to a nonsignificant increment (\u03b2 = \u20130.19; \u0394 R  2  = 0.03;  p  > 0.05). Rumination did not ex-plain cognitive performance in attention, verbal working memory, and memory either. Moreover, age was found to be a significant predictor of worse cognitive performance on processing speed (\u03b2  =  \u20130.60;  p  < 0.001), attention (\u03b2  =  \u20130.53;  p  < 0.001), and memory (\u03b2  =  \u20130.64;  p  < 0.001). At-tention was significantly predicted by duration of current depressive episode (poorer attention in case of prolonged episode) (\u03b2 = \u20130.29;  p  < 0.05) as well as by years of educa-tion (higher attention in case of more years of education) (\u03b2 = 0.30;  p  < 0.01). The HAMD score significantly pre-dicted the memory (\u03b2  =  \u20130.25;  p  < 0.05) of MDD patients.  Discussion  The aim of the current study was to determine wheth-er there is a connection between everyday-life rumination and cognitive impairments in attention, verbal working memory, memory, executive functions, and processing speed, respectively, in MDD patients. The results indicate that everyday rumination is associated with increased cognitive impairments with regard to information-pro-cessing speed in MDD. Moreover, high-ruminating de-pressive persons tend to exhibit impaired executive func-tions compared to low-ruminating persons. However, the impact of rumination on executive functions disappears after a hierarchical regression analysis. Beyond that, there is no association of rumination with impairments in the domains of attention, working memory as well as mem-ory. These results imply that rumination in everyday life does not necessarily lead to problems in cognition in gen-eral. Furthermore, we identified age, the duration of the  Table 4.

Our results indicate that cognitive impairments in MDD are linked to rumination in the domain of process-ing speed. This was the only cognitive domain that was influenced by rumination after including other predic-tors in the hierarchical regression analysis. To our knowl-edge, there has been no previous research on the impact of rumination on processing speed. This is, however, a basic cognitive domain which affects cognitive perfor-mance in general. In line with these results, previous stud-ies have suggested that cognitive impairments in depres-sion may be mediated in part or wholly by more basic deficits such as processing speed [e.g.  37\u201339  ]. These stud-ies did not, however, examine the influence of rumination in this context. It seems that rumination could be an un-derlying mechanism for the connection between process-ing speed and cognitive impairments in MDD. Further research is needed to assess this relationship and to gen-eralize the findings if possible.  Furthermore, our findings are partially consistent with the results of Davis and Nolen-Hoeksema  [15] , who ex-amined the influence of self-reported rumination on ex-ecutive functions, especially on executive control and cognitive flexibility. In their study, high ruminators made more preservative errors than nonruminators. In line with this finding high-ruminating MDD patients of the current study reached a lower score in the executive do-main (indicating greater deficits) than low ruminators. The decreasing influence of rumination on the executive domain score in further calculations may be due to the fact that the range between high and low rumination in the current study is smaller than between the high and nonruminators in Davis and Nolen-Hoeksema\u2019s  [15]  in-vestigation.  In contrast to previous reports from experimental studies, which showed an association between rumina-tion and attentional deficits [e.g.  16 ,  22 ], we found no significant difference between the 2 rumination groups in our analysis. Furthermore, our study does not support the existence of a link between rumination and memory def-icits as well as working memory deficits found by other researchers [e.g.  23 ,  24 ]. In this context the findings of Teasdale et al.  [40]  and Antrobus  [41]  have to be taken into consideration. They observed that increasing the cognitive demands of the current external task led to a reduction in the frequency of off-task thoughts, resulting in an improvement in task performance. These results suggest that attention-demanding tasks may disrupt ru-mination. In the current study, we observed rumination in the everyday life of patients, with no rumination induc-tion. For this reason, one could argue that a 1-h neuro-psychological examination already constitutes an in-creased cognitive demand, which interrupts rumination. In this brief period of time, participants of our study may exhibit a relative improvement in their cognitive perfor-mance compared to their performance in everyday life.  Another important point should be taken into consid-eration when interpreting the results concerning the in-fluence of rumination on memory. Based on evidence from \u201cchoking under pressure\u201d  [42, 43]  , it is plausible to assume that rumination as a predominantly verbal phe-nomenon mainly absorbs verbal capacities. Using a vi-sual but not a verbal memory test may cause less interfer-ence with rumination and therefore mask possible rela-tionships between rumination and memory. This fact may Iimit the interpretations to a nonsignificant relation-ship between rumination and visual memory, although there is a nonsignificant relationship between rumination and verbal working memory.  To our knowledge, the present investigation is the first that has attempted to systematically determine the impact of rumination on cognitive impairments in MDD in a broad range of cognitive domains. A differentiated stan-dardization was available for each domain. Another im-portant difference between the current study and the ma-jority of previous studies is the absence of induced rumi-nation. Typically, participants are induced to ruminate or distract from rumination, before being asked to complete cognitive tasks. These rumination and distraction induc-tions may produce stronger differences in cognitive per-formance in the laboratory compared to selecting par-ticipants based on their RSQ-D score.   However, there are some limitations to this study that should be addressed in future research. The first limita-tion is due to the outpatient MDD sample. Only 3 of 21 patients of the high-rumination group were male. There-fore, no conclusions can be drawn about the influence of gender. Furthermore, the variance of rumination scores in this sample was restricted; therefore, our results might underestimate the association between rumination and cognitive deficits. Further research should extend the sample in addition to inpatients and healthy controls. Secondly, one could argue that the lack of impact of ru-mination on some cognitive domains is due to the com-puting of the neuropsychological variables. Our cognitive performance parameters were computed by combining the test scores into a single index of specific cognitive do-mains. The score of the attention domain demonstrated Downloaded from http://karger.com/psp/article-pdf/50/5/347/3492414/000478785.pdf by UNC Chapel Hill user on 09 January 2024 Cognitive Impairments in Unipolar Depression Psychopathology 2017;50:347\u2013354DOI: 10.1159/000478785353moderate internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.63) and was below the recommended Cronbach \u03b1 of 0.70. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that the attention score was the only one with \u03b1 < 0.70; all other computed domain scores showed a high internal consistency (\u03b1 > 0.80). The third problem concerns the unequal distribution of partici-pants. The group of low ruminators was almost twice as large as that of the high ruminators. This restricted only the mean value analyses on the basis of  t  tests, but not the hierarchical regression analysis. Finally, it is also impor-tant to note that the present study did not allow us to draw any causal conclusions about the relationship between rumination and cognitive impairments in MDD. Due to the limitations mentioned above, it is important to verify whether our results can be generalized.  The current findings offer new insights into the fre-quently observed link between rumination and cognitive impairments in MDD. We have proved that patients who tend to ruminate in everyday life only show limitations in processing speed, but not a general reduction in their cog-nitive performance. For a limited period of time they can exhibit the cognitive performance comparable to that of low ruminators. Inpatients and healthy controls should be included in the samples of subsequent studies to enable generalization of this study\u2019s findings. Another question unanswered by this study concerns the point in time at which attention starts to tilt and provide space for rumi-nation under conditions of increasing cognitive demands. These prevailing ruminating thoughts can occupy cogni-tive resources and lead to a decreased cognitive perfor-mance, as shown in many experimental studies. This question is highly relevant in everyday life and highlights the necessity for further investigations.
