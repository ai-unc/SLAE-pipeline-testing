People with\ndepression also tend to focus on and think about their prob-\nlems (\u201cruminate\u201d) more than people without depression. Re-\ncent studies indicate that depressive rumination is connect-\ned to cognitive impairments in MDD. However, there is little\nscientific understanding of the role of rumination in these\ndeficits. Sampling and Methods: The current study exam-\nined the performance of 62 outpatients suffering from uni-\npolar major depression with a low tendency to ruminate ver-\nsus outpatients with a high tendency to ruminate using a\nneuropsychological battery covering the 5 cognitive do-\nmains: attention, memory, working memory, executive func-\ntions and processing speed. Results: The results indicated\nthat high ruminators show a lower performance than low\nruminators with regard to processing speed and executive\nfunction tasks with low effect sizes. However, these findings\nwere not significant after Bonferroni correction. Hierarchical\nlinear regression revealed that the effect on processing\n\nspeed could be partially attributed to rumination, but an ef-\nfect on executive functions was not established. Conclu-\nsions: The current study is the first to systematically investi-\ngate the impact of rumination on cognitive impairments in\nMDD, exploring a broad range of cognitive domains. The re-\nsults partially support the hypothesis that rumination has an\nimpact on single cognitive domains and highlight the neces-\nsity for further investigations in order to generalize these\nfindings. \u00a92017 5. Karger AG, Basel\n\nIntroduction\n\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with a\nwide range of affective and somatic symptoms as well as\ncognitive impairments in the acute state [1-4] and may\nbe long lasting despite symptom reduction and recovery\n[5, 6]. Rumination is often discussed as an important po-\ntential underlying cognitive mechanisms in the context of\ncognitive impairments in MDD. Rumination is a style of\nthinking characterized by repetitive, recurrent, intrusive,\nand uncontrollable thoughts [7]. These persistent nega-\ntive thoughts are a hallmark feature of MDD. People who\nruminate repetitively contemplate reasons for and conse-\nquences of their sadness [8]. Although ruminators believe\n\n\u00a92017 5.

Moreover, rumination has been identified as\na core risk factor for depression with serious clinical im-\nplications due to more depressed mood, longer depres-\nsive episodes and the occurrence of future depressive ep-\nisodes [7-10]. Recent studies indicate that depressive ru-\nmination is connected to cognitive impairments in MDD.\nIt is discussed as an important underlying cognitive\nmechanism. However, there is little understanding of the\nextent to which rumination influences cognitive perfor-\nmance, especially in single domains.\n\nRumination and Cognitive Impairments\n\nResource allocation theory posits that rumination ab-\nsorbs cognitive capacities which can thus not be directed\ntowards task-relevant processes [11-13]. According to\nthis theory, valuable cognitive resources are allocated to\nirrelevant depressive and ruminative thought processes.\nIndeed, there are many findings that support the link be-\ntween reduced cognitive performance and rumination as\nput forward in the dual-process model of cognitive vul-\nnerability in depressed persons. According to this model,\nthe ability of depressed individuals to implement correc-\ntive reflective processing in order to overcome automatic\nnegative biases is impaired, because this processing re-\nquires effort and cognitive resources that are not available\n[14]. Thus, rumination might reduce cognitive flexibility\nand raise interference levels above a critical threshold. In\nline with these results, Davis and Nolen-Hoeksema [15]\nshowed that participants who scored high on a self-report\nmeasure of ruminative style made more perseverative er-\nrors than nonruminators in the Wisconsin card sorting\ntest, a widely used measure of executive control and cogni-\ntive flexibility.\n\nIn addition, the dual-process model posits that the\ncognitive resources of depressed individuals might al-\nready be strained by competing mood-congruent and ru-\nminative thought processes [14]. In particular the brood-\ning, maladaptive component of rumination has been\nfound to be associated with higher negative attentional\nbiases [16], suggesting that depressed individuals with\nhigh levels of brooding have tightly connected negative\nschemata from which they have difficulty in breaking\naway. Some scholars, on the other hand, have related ru-\nmination to major deficits in cognitive control, regardless\nof the valence of the processed material. Specifically, ru-\nminators are thought to exhibit an impaired ability to\nflexibly shift attention or inhibit irrelevant information\n[e.g. 15,17].\n\n348 Psychopathology 2017;50:347-354\nDOI: 10.1159/000478785\n\nPrevious research has also reported that rumination is\nrelated to memory deficits and memory biases (18, 19]. For\nexample, when people are asked to recall memories of\nspecific autobiographical events, depressed patients are\nmore likely to retrieve overgeneral, categorical memories\nthat are summaries of repeated occasions than controls\n[for a review, see 20]. Watkins et al. [21] found that the\ndistraction induction (as a composite of rumination in-\nduction) significantly reduced overgeneral memory at\npreinduction levels.\n\nRumination has also been associated with working\nmemory deficits. Joormann and Gotlib [22] proved a link\nbetween rumination, impaired working memory, and de-\npression. They found that the interference of negative ir-\nrelevant words was correlated with self-reported rumina-\ntion. This relation with rumination was limited to the\nMDD group and remained significant even after partial-\ning out the level of depressive symptomatology: the high-\ner the participants\u2019 scored for the self-reported measure\nof rumination, the greater their difficulty in removing\ntask-irrelevant negative content from their working\nmemory. The connection between rumination and im-\npaired working memory was also reported by other au-\nthors [23, 24].\n\nThere have also been several experimental research\nstudies on the effect of induced rumination on executive\nfunctions [e.g. 25-27]. In the study by Watkins and Brown\n[13], for example, the performance of depressed patients\nand nondepressed controls was compared for a random\nnumber generation task, performed after either a rumina-\ntion or a distraction induction. Compared with the dis-\ntraction induction, the rumination induction produced a\nsignificant increase in stereotyped counting responses\n(reflecting a failure of inhibitory executive control) in de-\npressed patients but not in controls. However, after dis-\ntraction, no difference was found between the 2 groups.\nThe authors concluded that the rumination induction\nmay interfere with concurrent executive processing.\n\nIn sum, findings from the studies reviewed above ten-\ntatively support a connection between rumination and\ndeficits in cognitive performance. However, previous re-\nsearch on the impact of rumination on cognitive impair-\nments in MDD has a number of shortcomings and has left\nopen questions of which 3 seem especially important:\n\nPrevious studies reported the influence of ruminative\nthinking on memory, attention, or executive functions.\nHowever, most studies have assessed only 1 or very few\naspects of the specific domains such as attentional inflex-\nibility, cognitive control, cognitive inflexibility, or task\nswitching. So far there have been no studies that system-\n\nSchwert/Aschenbrenner/Weisbrod/\nSchroder\n\nIH 19d8UD ONIN AQ Jpd'S828.5000/% L\u00a5Z6YE/LVE/SI0G/Pd-arIe/dsd/uiod sabe. dy woy papeojumoq\n\n207 Arenuer go uo Jest\n\n\natically examine all cognitive domains. Therefore, gen-\neral knowledge on the impact of rumination on different\ncognitive domains in MDD is still very limited.\n\nFurthermore, many studies on rumination and cogni-\ntive dysfunctions have not controlled for the influence of\nother factors such as the severity of depression, the\namount of depressive episodes in the past, medication or\nduration of the current episode. Previous research has\nshown that these factors can strongly influence the extent\nof cognitive deficits in MDD [28]. Moreover, it seems es-\nsential to control for general factors such as age, patients\u2019\nintelligence, or level of education [29]. However, these\nfactors have not been taken into consideration so far.\n\nPrevious investigations have also failed to explore the\nrelationship between rumination in everyday life and\ncognitive performance. Most studies have assessed the in-\nfluence of rumination in an experimental design, which\nrequired participants to complete several cognitive tasks\nafter introducing rumination. Therefore, it stands to rea-\nson that rumination induced shortly before examination\nhas an impact on the ability to solve cognitive tasks. How-\never, it is unclear as to whether depressive patients who\nruminate a lot about themselves and their diseases in ev-\neryday life also exhibit higher cognitive impairments than\ndepressive patients whose tendency to ruminate in every-\nday life is not as pronounced.\n\nThe current study aims at answering the above-men-\ntioned questions, thus closing a gap in research by sys-\ntematically analyzing the relationship between assessed\neveryday-life rumination and different cognitive func-\ntions in MDD by controlling for as many influencing fac-\ntors as possible. Based on previous research, we hypoth-\nesize that the severity of cognitive deficits in MDD is re-\nlated to ruminative thinking.\n\nMethods\n\nParticipants\n\nThe sample consisted of 62 outpatients (age 18-66 years,\nmean = 43.32, SD = 12.93, 46 female) currently diagnosed with\nMDD. All participants fully met the criteria for a current unipolar\nMDD episode of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (4th ed., text rev., DSM-IV-TR [30]) on the basis of the\nStructured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID-I [31]). They\nwere recruited for the study from a university teaching outpatient\nclinic. Thirteen participants were diagnosed with comorbidity in\naddition to MDD: dysthymia (10 participants), bulimia nervosa\n(2 participants), and undifferentiated somatoform disorder (1 par-\nticipant). Participants with comorbid anxiety disorder, posttrau-\nmatic stress disorder, substance dependence, a history of head in-\njury, neurological disease, opioid or antipsychotic medication\nwere excluded. The clinical sample was divided into 2 groups: low\n\nCognitive Impairments in Unipolar\nDepression\n\nruminators and high ruminators based on their scores on the Re-\nsponse Style Questionnaire, German version (RSQ-D) [32], with a\nsum score of 40 and above indicating high rumination. Thirty-six\nparticipants (22% of low ruminators and 38% of high ruminators)\nwere taking antidepressants. Twenty-two participants were taking\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 5 selective norepinephrine\nreuptake inhibitors, 11 noradrenergic and specific serotonergic\nantidepressants, 5 tricyclic antidepressants, and 1 was taking\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors.\n\n\u2018Measures\n\nHamilton Depression Rating Scale\n\nThe 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\n(HAMD) [33] was used. The HAMD is the most commonly used\nclinical scale to assess the severity of depression in clinical practice\nand research [34].\n\nResponse Styles Questionnaire, German Version\n\nThe RSQ [32] is a self-report instrument that assesses the ten-\ndency to respond to negative emotions with ruminative thoughts.\nParticipants respond to items on a 4-point scale anchored by \u201cal-\nmost never\u201d and \u201calmost always.\u201d The authors report high test-\nretest reliability and internal consistency for the RSQ-D.\n\nNeuropsychological Assessment\nThe neuropsychological tests were taken from the COGBAT\ntest battery of the Vienna test system [35]. The test set measures\nsubdimensions in the areas of attention, memory, verbal working\nmemory, executive functions, and processing speed and has been\nvalidated across neurological and psychiatric populations.\n\nProcedure\n\nAll participants were recruited from the outpatient psychother-\napy clinic of the University of Landau, Germany, where they asked\nfor psychotherapy. As it is usual routine of the outpatient clinic,\npotential patients were invited for a first screening interview. If\ndepressive symptoms were identified and were of major concern\nto the patients, they were informed of the study. If they agreed to\nparticipate, informed consent was obtained.\n\nThe assessment was divided into two 1-h sessions. In the first\nsession, trained interviewers administered the structured clinical\nInterview for the DSM-IV [36] to participants to ensure that they\nfully met the criteria for a current unipolar MDD episode. After-\nwards participants were interviewed regarding further criteria for\nbeing included in or excluded from the study and were rated on\nthe HAMD [33]. In a next step, they completed the RSQ-D [32]. A\nfew days after the first session, participants came to our laboratory\nto complete the cognitive tasks with the neuropsychological test\nbattery COGBAT. All participants were tested individually after\nhaving completed the informed consent form. The research was\napproved by the Local Research Ethics Committees.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nAll statistical comparisons were performed using the Statistical\nPackage for the Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows, version 21).\nThe neuropsychological test scores were transformed into stan-\ndardized (2) scores and polarized in 1 direction (with higher scores\nindicating a better performance). Performance was calculated sep-\narately for the 5 cognitive domains of information-processing\nspeed, attention, verbal working memory, memory, and executive\n\nPsychopathology 2017;50:347-354 349\nDOI: 10.1159/000478785\n\nH\n3\nH\n2\n8\nES\ng\ng\nB\ne\na\nH\nH\nc\nH\n3\n2\nH\nz\n\n207 Arenuer go uo Jest\n\n\nTable 1.

The results indicate\nthat everyday rumination is associated with increased\ncognitive impairments with regard to information-pro-\ncessing speed in MDD. Moreover, high-ruminating de-\npressive persons tend to exhibit impaired executive func-\ntions compared to low-ruminating persons. However, the\nimpact of rumination on executive functions disappears\nafter a hierarchical regression analysis. Beyond that, there\nis no association of rumination with impairments in the\ndomains of attention, working memory as well as mem-\nory. These results imply that rumination in everyday life\ndoes not necessarily lead to problems in cognition in gen-\neral.

This was the only cognitive domain that was\ninfluenced by rumination after including other predic-\ntors in the hierarchical regression analysis. To our knowl-\nedge, there has been no previous research on the impact\nof rumination on processing speed. This is, however, a\nbasic cognitive domain which affects cognitive perfor-\nmance in general. In line with these results, previous stud-\nies have suggested that cognitive impairments in depres-\nsion may be mediated in part or wholly by more basic\ndeficits such as processing speed [e.g. 37-39]. These stud-\nies did not, however, examine the influence of rumination\nin this context. It seems that rumination could be an un-\nderlying mechanism for the connection between process-\ning speed and cognitive impairments in MDD. Further\nresearch is needed to assess this relationship and to gen-\neralize the findings if possible.\n\nFurthermore, our findings are partially consistent with\nthe results of Davis and Nolen-Hoeksema [15], who ex-\namined the influence of self-reported rumination on ex-\necutive functions, especially on executive control and\ncognitive flexibility. In their study, high ruminators made\nmore preservative errors than nonruminators. In line\nwith this finding high-ruminating MDD patients of the\ncurrent study reached a lower score in the executive do-\nmain (indicating greater deficits) than low ruminators.\nThe decreasing influence of rumination on the executive\ndomain score in further calculations may be due to the\nfact that the range between high and low rumination in\nthe current study is smaller than between the high and\nnonruminators in Davis and Nolen-Hoeksema\u2019s [15] in-\nvestigation.\n\nIn contrast to previous reports from experimental\nstudies, which showed an association between rumina-\ntion and attentional deficits [e.g. 16, 22], we found no\nsignificant difference between the 2 rumination groups in\nour analysis. Furthermore, our study does not support the\nexistence of a link between rumination and memory def-\nicits as well as working memory deficits found by other\nresearchers [e.g. 23, 24]. In this context the findings of\nTeasdale et al. [40] and Antrobus [41] have to be taken\ninto consideration. They observed that increasing the\ncognitive demands of the current external task led to a\nreduction in the frequency of off-task thoughts, resulting\nin an improvement in task performance. These results\nsuggest that attention-demanding tasks may disrupt ru-\n\n352 Psychopathology 2017;50:347-354\nDOI: 10.1159/000478785\n\nmination. In the current study, we observed rumination\nin the everyday life of patients, with no rumination induc-\ntion. For this reason, one could argue that a 1-h neuro-\npsychological examination already constitutes an in-\ncreased cognitive demand, which interrupts rumination.\nIn this brief period of time, participants of our study may\nexhibit a relative improvement in their cognitive perfor-\nmance compared to their performance in everyday life.\n\nAnother important point should be taken into consid-\neration when interpreting the results concerning the in-\nfluence of rumination on memory. Based on evidence\nfrom \u201cchoking under pressure\u201d [42, 43], it is plausible to\nassume that rumination as a predominantly verbal phe-\nnomenon mainly absorbs verbal capacities. Using a vi-\nsual but not a verbal memory test may cause less interfer-\nence with rumination and therefore mask possible rela-\ntionships between rumination and memory. This fact\nmay limit the interpretations to a nonsignificant relation-\nship between rumination and visual memory, although\nthere is a nonsignificant relationship between rumination\nand verbal working memory.\n\nTo our knowledge, the present investigation is the first\nthat has attempted to systematically determine the impact\nof rumination on cognitive impairments in MDD in a\nbroad range of cognitive domains. A differentiated stan-\ndardization was available for each domain. Another im-\nportant difference between the current study and the ma-\njority of previous studies is the absence of induced rumi-\nnation. Typically, participants are induced to ruminate or\ndistract from rumination, before being asked to complete\ncognitive tasks. These rumination and distraction induc-\ntions may produce stronger differences in cognitive per-\nformance in the laboratory compared to selecting par-\nticipants based on their RSQ-D score.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to this study that\nshould be addressed in future research. The first limita-\ntion is due to the outpatient MDD sample. Only 3 of 21\npatients of the high-rumination group were male. There-\nfore, no conclusions can be drawn about the influence of\ngender. Furthermore, the variance of rumination scores\nin this sample was restricted; therefore, our results might\nunderestimate the association between rumination and\ncognitive deficits. Further research should extend the\nsample in addition to inpatients and healthy controls.\nSecondly, one could argue that the lack of impact of ru-\nmination on some cognitive domains is due to the com-\nputing of the neuropsychological variables. Our cognitive\nperformance parameters were computed by combining\nthe test scores into a single index of specific cognitive do-\nmains. The score of the attention domain demonstrated\n\nSchwert/Aschenbrenner/Weisbrod/\nSchroder\n\nIH 19d8UD ONIN AQ Jpd'S828.5000/% L\u00a5Z6YE/LVE/SI0G/Pd-arIe/dsd/uiod sabe. dy woy papeojumoq\n\n207 Arenuer go uo Jest\n\n\nmoderate internal consistency (a = 0.63) and was below\nthe recommended Cronbach a of 0.70. In this respect, it\nis worth mentioning that the attention score was the only\none with a < 0.70; all other computed domain scores\nshowed a high internal consistency (a > 0.80). The third\nproblem concerns the unequal distribution of partici-\npants. The group of low ruminators was almost twice as\nlarge as that of the high ruminators. This restricted only\nthe mean value analyses on the basis of t tests, but not the\nhierarchical regression analysis. Finally, it is also impor-\ntant to note that the present study did not allow us to draw\nany causal conclusions about the relationship between\nrumination and cognitive impairments in MDD. Due to\nthe limitations mentioned above, it is important to verify\nwhether our results can be generalized.\n\nThe current findings offer new insights into the fre-\nquently observed link between rumination and cognitive\nimpairments in MDD. We have proved that patients who\ntend to ruminate in everyday life only show limitations in\nprocessing speed, but not a general reduction in their cog-\nnitive performance. For a limited period of time they can\nexhibit the cognitive performance comparable to that of\nlow ruminators. Inpatients and healthy controls should\n\nbe included in the samples of subsequent studies to enable\ngeneralization of this study\u2019s findings. Another question\nunanswered by this study concerns the point in time at\nwhich attention starts to tilt and provide space for rumi-\nnation under conditions of increasing cognitive demands.\nThese prevailing ruminating thoughts can occupy cogni-\ntive resources and lead to a decreased cognitive perfor-\nmance, as shown in many experimental studies. This\nquestion is highly relevant in everyday life and highlights\nthe necessity for further investigations.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\u2018Weare grateful to all participating patients and control subjects\nas well as Schuhfried GmbH, M\u00e9dling, for supporting the study\nwith non-monetary resources.\n\nDisclosure Statement\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the ab-\nsence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be\nconstrued as a potential conflict of interest.\n\nReferences\n\nBora E, Harrison BJ, Yiicel M, Pantelis C: ~~ 9 Moberly NJ, Watkins ER: Processing mode 18 Hertel PT: The relationship between rumina-\nCognitive impairment in euthymic major de- influences the relationship between trait ru- tion and impaired memory in dysphoric\npressive disorder: a meta-analysis.
