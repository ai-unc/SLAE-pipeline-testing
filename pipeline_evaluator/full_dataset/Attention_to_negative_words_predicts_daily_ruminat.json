Nezlekd,eaFaculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland;bPsychology Department, SWPS University of Social Sciences andHumanities, Warsaw, Poland;cInstitute of Psychology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland;dDepartment of Psychology,SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Pozna \u0144, Poland;eDepartment of Psychology, College of William & Mary,Williamsburg, VA, USAABSTRACTThe present study examined relationships between attention to negative words anddaily rumination and daily adjustment in a sample of clinically depressedindividuals. We recorded eye movements of 43 individuals diagnosed with majordepression while they were freely viewing dysphoric, threat-related, neutral, andpositive words. Then, each day for one week, participants provided measures oftheir daily rumination and psychological adjustment. Multilevel analyses found thatattention to dysphoric and threat-related words was positively related to dailyrumination and attention to threat-related words was negatively related to dailyadjustment. These \ufb01ndings suggest that the impaired ability to disengage fromnegative words is positively related to rumination in daily life and is negativelyrelated to well-being, as de \ufb01ned in terms of Beck \u2019s Triad.ARTICLE HISTORYReceived 13 February 2018Revised 17 October 2018Accepted 18 October 2018KEYWORDSRumination; attentional bias;eye movements; diary studyCognitive theories of depression posit that persistentnegative cognitions and cognitive biases, such asattentional bias to negative information, lead to thedevelopment and maintenance of depression (e.g.Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979 ). Negative cognitions,characterized by repetitive, recurrent, intrusive, anduncontrollable thoughts, have been broadly de \ufb01nedas rumination (Brinker & Dozois, 2009 ). Moreover,attentional biases and rumination play key roles inthe NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of NegativeValence Systems construct of Loss (NIMH, 2008 ).Although research has found that depression isrelated to attentional biases (e.g. Armstrong & Olatunji,2012 ) and increased ruminative thinking (e.g. Aldao,Nolen-Hoeksema, & Schwiezer, 2010 ), only a fewstudies have examined direct relationships betweenattentional biases and ruminative style in depression.In a study of a clinically depressed sample, Donald-son, Lam, and Mathews ( 2007 ) found a positiverelationship between trait rumination and attentionalbiases to depression-related information using a dot-probe task. Similarly, Joormann, Dkane, and Gotlib(2006 ) reported that rumination was associated withincreased attention to sad faces in currently depressedadults.1Sustained visual processing of negative faceswas found to be associated with a stronger ruminativestyle in dysphoric and non-dysphoric students (Duque,Sanchez, & Vazquez, 2014 ). Consistent with this, Owensand Gibb ( 2017 ) found that rumination was positivelyrelated to attention to sad faces and was negativelyrelated to happy faces in non-depressed individuals.Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no study hasexamined relationships between attention to negativewords and daily rumination in clinically depressedindividuals. Moreover, to our knowledge, no studyhas used eye-tracking to examine relationshipsbetween attentional biases and rumination amongthose with clinical depression. The present studyexamined relationships between attention toemotional words and daily reports of rumination andpsychological adjustment among the clinicallydepressed.\u00a9 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupCONTACT Pawe \u0142Holas pawel.holas@psych.uw.edu.plCOGNITION AND EMOTION2019, VOL. 33, NO. 6, 1277 \u20131283https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2018.1541168Attentional biases in depressionAlthough a recent meta-analysis questioned theassociation between attentional bias and depressivesymptoms (Marchetti et al., 2018 ), the bulk of researchhas found that attentional biases in depression consistof greater maintenance of gaze on negative infor-mation and a lack of the positive attentional biasthat is typically reported in healthy people in eye-tracking studies (Armstrong & Olatunji, 2012 ). Biasedattention to emotional stimuli a \ufb00ects the course ofdepression by elevating the rate of incoming negativeemotional information and decreasing the rate ofincoming positive information, which leads to morepersistent sad moods (Joormann & Arditte, 2013 ). Con-sistent with this, in a study of depressed individuals,Disner, Shumake, and Beevers ( 2017 ) found that atten-tion to negative words was positively related toincreases over time in depressive symptoms, andDonaldson et al. ( 2007 ) found that attentional biasfor negative words was positively related to traitrumination.Impaired disengagement hypothesis ofruminationThe impaired disengagement hypothesis of rumina-tion posits that the positive relationship between theamount of time spent processing negative self-refer-ential material and levels of rumination is due toimpaired attentional disengagement (Koster, De Liss-nyder, Derakshan, & De Raedt, 2011 ), and as discussedby Koster et al. ( 2011 ), several studies have found thatrumination is related to impairments and valence-speci\ufb01c biases in attentional control. A lack of inhibi-tory control over negative information prevents indi-viduals from implementing emotion regulationstrategies that may be more adaptive than rumination,such as redirection of attention or positive reappraisal(Joormann & D \u2019Avanzato, 2010 ) and leads to increasesin the amount of negative information enteringworking memory (Koster et al., 2011 ). Consistentwith this, Southworth, Grafton, MacLeod, andWatkins ( 2017 ) found that rumination was positivelyrelated to dif \ufb01culty in disengaging attention fromnegative to positive words.Issues in measuring ruminationStudies of relationships between rumination andattentional processes have used single-assessmentmeasures of dispositional rumination such as theRuminative Responses Sca le (RRS) (Treynor, Gonza-lez, & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2003 ). Respondents indicatehow they are on average or usually, often withoutreferring to speci \ufb01c temporal or situational circum-stances. As discussed by Nezlek ( 2012 ), measuringindividual di \ufb00erences using single-assessments hasimportant limitations. Single assessments mayre\ufb02e c tm o r er e c e n to rm o r ei m p o r t a n ts t a t e st h a nmore temporally distant or less important states,e.g. a negative event from the past week in \ufb02uencesresponses more than the po sitive events from theweek. Also, the temporal frame of questions isoften not speci \ufb01ed, and individual di \ufb00erences inhow people interpret \u201cgenerally \u201dor\u201ctypically \u201dcanin\ufb02uence responses. To overcome some of theselimitations, in the present study we measured rumi-nation on a daily basis using a measure that focusedon the present day.The present studyDespite the results of previous studies, the role ofvisual processing of negative stimuli in maintenanceof depression needs to be clari \ufb01ed. Although severalstudies have found positive relationships betweenrumination and impaired executive control, fewstudies have examined the impaired attentional disen-gagement hypothesis using methods that can dis-tinguish engagement and disengagement biases(Southworth et al., 2017 ) or that included continuousmeasures of eye behaviour (Owens & Gibb, 2017 ).The present study examined relationships betweenattention to negative words and daily ruminationand daily psychological adjustment in depressed indi-viduals. We assumed that attention to negative wordswould be related to a depressogenic thinking style/process, rumination, and would be related to depres-sogenic thought content, a measure of adjustmentbased on Beck \u2019s cognitive triad.We measured attention to negative words usingeye-tracking. This provided a direct measure of atten-tion which we believe is an improvement overmethods that evaluate the allocation of attentionindirectly from response latencies to probes.Di\ufb03culty in disengaging attention from negativestimuli should be manifested by longer attention(dwell time) to negative stimuli. We hypothesizedthat dwell time on negative words would be positivelyrelated to daily rumination and negatively related todaily adjustment.1278 P .H O L A SE TA L .MethodParticipantsParticipants were recruited via an open call posted oninternet portals. The call invited volunteers to participatein a study about how people feel and how they processinformation in their daily lives. Initially, 221 peopleresponded to this call, and of these, 199 completed anonline version of the CES-D (Radlo \ufb00,1977). Individualswho had CES-D scores of greater than 20 ( N=7 3 )w e r einvited for an individual interview during which theMini-International Neuropsy chiatric Interview (V. 5.0.0;Sheehan et al., 1998 ) was administered by a trained clin-ician. To be eligible for the study, individuals had to bediagnosed as currently experiencing a major depressiondisorder episode. Individuals were excluded if they hadbipolar disorder, substance abuse, a current or lifetimepsychotic disorder or current suicidal tendencies. Tenparticipants dropped out from the study after beginningthe study. Due to technical problems with recording eyemovements (e.g. poor calibration) or compliance withinstructions the \ufb01nal sample consisted of 43 participants(F=2 9 , Mage=3 4 . 4 2 , SD= 12.71). Thirty-two participants(74%) had a comorbid diagnosis, 27 of whom were diag-nosed with an accompanying anxiety disorder. Partici-pants were paid approximately 30USD.ProcedureFirst, participants came the laboratory and completedthe eye-tracking task and three questionnaires. Theythen maintained an online diary for at least 7 consecu-tive days.The research protocol was approved by the IRB ofthe authors \u2019institution. All participants providedwritten informed consent.Self-report measuresParticipants completed three measures: the Centerfor Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D:Radlo \ufb00,1977 ), the trait subscale of the State-TraitAnxiety Inventory (STAI: Spielberger, 1989 ), and thePenn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ: Meyer,Miller, Metzger, & Borkovec, 1990 ). Descriptive stat-istics for these measures are presented in Table 1 .Eye tracking measuresFour words taskFollowing the procedure used by Ellis, Beevers, andWells ( 2011 ), we presented 12 slides with 4 words oneach, and participants were asked to read the words.Words were selected from the A \ufb00ective Norms forEnglish Words (ANEW, Bradley & Lang, 1999 ). Therewere four categories of words: dysphoric (e.g. gloom,sad), threat-related (e.g. killer, angry), neutral (e.g.ankle, sphere), and positive (e.g. home, sun). Eachslide was presented for 10 sec and contained oneword from each category. Words presented on thesame slide were matched for length, and the orderof slides was randomized. At the beginning of eachtrial a \ufb01xation cross appeared in the middle of thescreen for 1000 ms.ApparatusThe stimuli were presented on a 22 \u2019diameter monitorat a viewing distance of 70 cm. Participants \u2019eye move-ments were recorded with a SMI RED eye-tracker, witha sampling rate of 120 Hz and a 9-point calibrationbefore the task. Measurements were made in a roomwith no windows and constant ambient light. SMI \u2019sstandard BeGaze dispersion-based algorithm wasused for detecting \ufb01xations and saccades. Theminimal \ufb01xation duration was set to 80 ms.Rectangular areas of interest were drawn aroundeach word, and we calculated the total time spent\ufb01xating on the target stimuli (dwell time). One partici-pant had an extreme value (+ 3SD) of dwell time onpositive words. We conducted the analyses with andwithout this case, and the results were similar, so wereport the results with all cases included.Table 1.

Dailyrumination was measured using three items from theRumination-Re \ufb02ection Questionnaire (Trapnell & Camp-bell, 1999 ) that were reworded for daily administration.Participants answered the following questions: Howmuch today did you \u201cruminate \u201dor dwell on thingsthat happened to you? How much today did you playback over in your mind how you acted in a past situ-ation? How much time today did you spend rethinkingthings that are over and done with? Daily adjustmentwas measured with three items based on Beck et al. \u2019s(1979 ) cognitive triad: Thinking about today ingeneral how positive were your thoughts about your-self? How well did things go today? Today, how opti-mistic are you about how your life (in general) will betomorrow? Participants answered using 1 \u20137s c a l e s ,scored so that higher numbers indicated more rumina-tion and better adjustment during the day.Compliance with instructionsBefore analysing the data, we inspected the time ofparticipants \u2019entries. Valid entries were de\ufb01 ned asthose provided after 6 pm of the day in questionand no later than 6 am of the following day. Followingthis procedure, we analysed 251 days, and participantsprovided on average 6.0 days of diary data.ResultsThe data were conceptualized as a two level structurein which days were nested within individuals. We ana-lysed the data using multilevel models using the pro-gramme HLM following guidelines described byNezlek ( 2012 ). Before the primary analyses, thereliability of our measures was examined using threelevel models in which items were nested within daysand days were nested within persons (Nezlek, 2017 ).These analyses provided the multilevel equivalent ofa Cronbach \u2019s alpha, corrected for di \ufb00erencesbetween persons and days. The reliabilities were satis-factory (see Table 2 ).Descriptive statistics for daily rumination andadjustmentThe\ufb01rst analyses were null models (no predictors ateither level of analysis). These analyses estimated themeans and the within- and between-variances of ourdaily measures, and the results are summarized inTable 2 . The model is below. There were idaysnested within jpersons. The variance of rijis thewithin-person (level 1) variance, and the variance ofu0jis the between-person (level 2) variance.Within-person: yij=\u03b20j+rijBetween-person: \u03b20j=\u03b300+u0jThese analyses found that there was su \ufb03cientwithin-person variability to conclude that peoplevaried from day to day, while there was alsosu\ufb03cient stability within-persons (the between-person variance) to make it meaningful to examinebetween-person di \ufb00erences in means of our dailymeasures. Moreover, the means for both measureswere toward the midpoint of the scale, suggestingthat\ufb02oor and ceiling e \ufb00ects would not in\ufb02 uence ourresults.Relationships between attention to words andself-report measuresNext, we examined relationships between attention tothe four word categories and trait measures ofdepression, worry, and anxiety. Descriptive statisticsfor and correlations between these measures are pre-sented in Table 1 . There were signi \ufb01cant positive cor-relations between attention to threat-related,dysphoric, and neutral words. Attention to positivewords was negatively related to worry, whereasanxiety was positively correlated with worry. Attentionto threat-related and neutral words was not signi\ufb01 -cantly related to any trait measure, and dysphoricwords at statistical tendency level were positivelyrelated to depression.Relationships between attentional bias andmean daily rumination and daily adjustmentNext, we examined relationships between eye-track-ing measures and daily rumination and adjustmentby including measures of dwell times as level 2 predic-tors (see below). We conducted separate analyses foreach measure of dwell time. The results of these ana-lyses are summarized in Table 3 . Level 2 predictorswere standardized before analysis.Table 2. Descriptive statistics for daily measures.Daily measureVarianceReliabilityMean Between WithinRumination 3.25 1.03 1.28 .76Adjustment 4.20 .26 .62 .711280 P .H O L A SE TA L .Between-person: \u03b20j=\u03b300+\u03b301*(dwell time) + u0jAs expected, we found signi \ufb01cant relationshipsbetween dwell time on negative words and dailyrumination and adjustment. Daily rumination waspositively related to dwell time on dysphoric words(\u03b301= .36, t= 3.23, p< .01) and to dwell time onthreat-related words ( \u03b301= .63, t= 3.96, p< .001), anddaily adjustment was negatively related to dwelltime on threat-related words ( \u03b301=\u2212.21, t= 2.53,p< .02). In general, the longer participants dwelledon both dysphoric and threat-related words, themore they ruminated each day, and the more theydwelled on threat-related words the poorer was theirpsychological adjustment each day. In contrast, wefound no signi\ufb01 cant relationships between attentionto positive words and daily rumination or adjustment.To control for individual di \ufb00erences in attention perse, we calculated the amount of time participantsspent looking at parts of the stimuli that were notwords. The relationships we found between rumina-tion and dwell time on dysphoric and threat-relatedwords and between adjustment and dwell time onthreat-related words remained signi\ufb01 cant after con-trolling for time spent looking at parts of the stimulusarray that were not words. The coe \ufb03cient betweendaily rumination and dysphoric words was \u03b301= .33(p= .005), the coe \ufb03cient between daily ruminationand threat-related words was \u03b301= .62 ( p= .001), andthe coe \ufb03cient between daily adjustment and threat-related words was \u03b301=\u2212.18 ( p< .05).Using similar models, we examined relationshipsdaily rumination and adjustment and the CES-D,STAI, and PSWQ (see Table 3 ). Daily rumination waspositively related to CES-D scores ( \u03b301= .24, t= 2.14,p< .04) and daily adjustment was negatively relatedto PSWQ scores ( \u03b301=\u2212.20, t= 2.31, p< .03). We thenexamined relationships between our daily measuresand the self-report and eye-tracking measures thatwere signi \ufb01cant in the original analyses. For daily rumi-nation, when attention to dysphoric words, attentionto threat-related words, and depression were simul-taneously included as level 2 (person-level predictors),only attention to threat-related words remained sig-ni\ufb01cant related to daily rumination ( \u03b301= .64, t= 2.97,p< .01). For daily adjustment, when attention to dys-phoric words, attention to threat-related words, andworry were simultaneously included as level 2(person-level predictors), attention to threat-relatedwords and worry were negatively related to dailyadjustment, although not at the .05 level ( \u03b301=\u2212.17,t= 1.76, p= .087; \u03b301=\u2212.18, t= 1.96, p= .057,respectively).Within-person relationship betweenrumination and adjustmentWe examined within-person relationships betweendaily rumination and daily adjustment by includingdaily adjustment as a level 1 predictor of rumination,and we found a signi \ufb01cant negative relationship ( \u03b310=\u2212.32,t= 2.88, p< .01). Analyses of trait level moder-ation did not \ufb01nd that this relationship varied as afunction of our trait level variables (all ps> .2).DiscussionAs expected, attention to negative words (dysphoricand threat-related) was positively related to howmuch depressed people ruminated each day. In con-trast, attention to positive and neutral words wasnot related to daily rumination or adjustment. Theseresults are consistent with the proposal that sustainedprocessing of negative information leads to rumina-tion (Koster et al., 2011 ; Whitmer & Gotlib, 2013 ).Previous research has consistently found positiverelationships between rumination and biases in atten-tional control, inhibition, and set shifting functions(e.g. Koster et al., 2011 ); however, these studiesassessed cognitive control functions, not attentionitself. Moreover, most previous research has notstudied people who were clinically depressed, butindividuals (often undergraduates) with elevateddepressive symptoms, and they measured ruminationusing single assessment questionnaires. The currentstudy represents an improvement over the existingresearch because it examined a clinically depressedsample, measured attention directly, and measuredrumination on a daily basis.Table 3.

As noted pre-viously, 30 of our 43 participants had been diagnosedwith an anxiety disorder, and analyses of participantswho did not have an accompanying anxiety diagnosisfound the same relationships that were found in theanalyses of the full sample. These results suggestthat depressed individuals may be more hypersensi-tive to threatening stimuli independent of the factthey also tend to be anxious.On the other hand, some have suggested that theheightened threat response observed amongdepressed people might be due to the comorbidityof depression and anxiety (Engels et al., 2010 ), andthe mean STAI score was elevated compared toPolish norms for a distressed sample (e.g. Wrze \u015b-niewski, Matusik, & Sosnowski, 2002 ). The results ofanalyses that included only participants with STAIscores below the mean reported by Wrze \u015bniewskiet al. were similar to the results that included all par-ticipants. We address this issue below.We also found that attention to threat-relatedwords was negatively related to a measure of dailyadjustment based on Beck \u2019s depressive cognitivetriad. Biased attention to negative words may facilitatesustained processing of negative information which inturn may manifest itself by increased depressivethoughts and catastrophizing about the self, thecurrent day, and the near future (Beck \u2019s triad). Wealso found a negative relationship between adjust-ment and worry, which suggests that the aspects ofdepression we measured are related more to threatsensitivity than to sadness per se. Consistent withsuch a possibility, Rochat, Billieux, and Van derLinden ( 2012 ) found that di \ufb03culty in disengagingfrom negative stimuli was positively related to mala-daptive self-referential thinking, including rumination,self-blame, and catastrophizing.Limitations and future directionsAlthough the present study supported our predictions,it had limitations. For example, even though there areno data or theoretically based reasons that suggestthat our results are speci \ufb01c to our use of end of dayreports, it is possible that other data collection proto-cols, e.g. multiple assessments each day, would haveproduced di \ufb00erent results. Also, we did not have alarge enough sample to provide a basis for comparingindividuals who were depressed but not anxious toindividuals who were depressed and anxious.More important, our design did not provide a basisfor making strong inferences about causality. Furtherresearch is needed to verify that attention to negativewords leads to increases in daily rumination. Thiscould be done by examining if modifying attentionalbiases alters daily rumination. Although there is pre-liminary evidence that modi \ufb01cation of attentionalbiases may reduce state rumination (Cohen, Daches,Mor, & Henik, 2014 ), and although the unidirectionalnature of the relationship between attentional pro-cesses and rumination is assumed in prominent theor-etical accounts (cf. Koster et al., 2011 ), suchrelationships are far from clearly established. Asidefrom the concerns about whether attentional biasand depressive symptoms are related (e.g. Marchettiet al., 2018 ) there is possibility that rumination maybe triggered by higher-order processes and constructs(for example, metacognitions) that in turn in\ufb02 uenceboth attention and attentional biases.The present \ufb01ndings suggest some directions fordevelopment of attention bias modi \ufb01cation pro-grammes in depression. If attention to negativestimuli leads to rumination, it may be possible toreduce rumination by reducing attention to negativestimuli, which may be associated with or lead to areduction in depressive symptoms. Moreover, rumina-tion is a transdiagnostic process that is related toseveral forms of psychopathology (Aldao et al.,2010 ), and so understanding the sources of rumina-tion could be important for the prevention and treat-ment of variety of a \ufb00ective disorders, including mood,anxiety, and eating disorders.Note1. Based on the distinction between re \ufb02ection and rumina-tion as two types of self-focused attention made by Trap-nell and Campbell ( 1999 ) we use the term \u201crumination \u201dtorefer to what some describe as \u201cbrooding rumination \u201d.Disclosure statementNo potential con \ufb02ict of interest was reported by the authors.1282 P .H O L A SE TA L .FundingSupport for this research was provided by the NarodoweCentrum Nauki, Grant/Award Number: [2012/04/M/HS6/00/470to Izabela Krejtz].ReferencesAldao, A., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., & Schwiezer, S.
