# text, format_instructions and relationships are automatically generated variables
instructions: |
  You will be given text from an academic paper. Your task is to classify causal relationship between the variables in the text.
  For example, if the text includes "We find a strong correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then a relation should be output like "Country's per capita income -> Country's literacy rate", and the the relation_classification would be direct.
  If instead the text includes "We find a strong negative correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the relation_classification would be inverse.
  The supporting_text field of your output should include reasoning for the relation  summarized from the text.
  The supporting_text field should be used to step by step reason from the text of the paper to try to come up with a good relationship classification and should focus on plainly stated results over implications.
  The relation_classification field can only be 'direct', 'inverse', or 'independent'. 
  "direct" means that an increase in one associates with an increase in another. 
  "inverse" means that an increase in one associates with a decrease in another.
  "independent" means there is no clear relationship between the two variables.
  The attributes field should include any other relevant factors affecting the relationship. If none are present, the field should contain "N/A".
  There may be any number of relationships present in the text. Output as many accurate relationships as possible.
